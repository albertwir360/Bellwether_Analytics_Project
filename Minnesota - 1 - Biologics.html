    Arrhythmic cardiomyopathy can cause severe problems including cardiac arrest and death. Unfortunately, many of the therapeutics to treat arrhythmias can actually have pro-arrhythmic side effects. This technology is an antagomir
    targeting miR-448 (anti-miR-448), a microRNA linked to the downregulation of the sodium channel SCN5A. Relieving the inhibition of miR-448 facilitates the upregulation of SCN5A, which is protective against arrhythmia, while bypassing
    the potential pro-arhythmic side-effects of existing therapies.

    Currently, there is no clinically approved drug to specifically treat the SARS-CoV-2 viral infections, and owing to the catastrophic nature of the pandemic there is a race to find a viable treatment. Unfortunately, many traditional drug
    types have limitations that slow the speed at which they can be identified and developed. Small molecule drugs often suffer from relatively low specificity (resulting in side effects). Conversely, traditional antibody drugs often have
    poor pharmacokinetics, are unstable and are expensive to produce. As an alternative route to avoid these limitations, Dr. Fang Li’s lab and Dr. Aaron LeBeau’s lab at the University of Minnesota have developed a series of camelid
    nanobodies (“Nanosota-1”) that are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
</p>
,
<p>
    Nanobodies are single domain antibodies produced by camels and llamas that are much smaller than traditional antibodies, but still bind with high affinity and specificity. Representative nanobodies in the Nanosota series have been
    experimentally shown to bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with high affinity, block binding of the protein to the human ACE2 receptor, and inhibit entry into mammalian cells. Owing to their optimal therapeutic and physical properties, these
    camelid nanobodies have high potential for development into a novel COVID-19 treatment. Development is ongoing and animal trials are underway. Preliminary results have shown that one representative nanobody protected hamsters from
    SARS-CoV-2 infections both prophylactically and therapeutically.

    More than one-third of adults in the US are obese and anually $190 billion is spent on the treatment of obesity and obesity-related complications. Health care providers are in need of new approaches to combat this growing health crisis.
    While there are many pathways in the body that control appetite and weight, the final step is controlled by two receptors in the brain, melanocortin receptors 3 and 4 (MC3R and MC4R). Previous work research failed to identify agonists
    for MC3R, so much effort has been put into anti-obesity compounds targeting MC4R. Unfortunately, these molecules have resulted in increased blood pressure in humans. Dr. Haskell-Luevano at the University of Minnesota has developed the
    first compounds that activate MC3R, while inhibiting MC4R. This unique activity profile is anticipated to increase weight-loss in patients without causing hypertension.
</p>
,
<p>
    Using an uncommon (but powerful) screening approach, Dr. Haskell-Luevano identified compounds in a brand new chemical space for melanocortin agonists. As the first compounds ever reported to selectively activate MC3R, these cyclized,
    penta-peptides represent promising anti-obesity therapeutics. Furthermore, their antagonistic activity against MC4R, minimizes the risk of high blood pressure observed with previous melanocortin receptor-targeting drugs. Additionally,
    there is evidence for MC3R dependent anti-inflammatory activity in vascular and lung tissue, so these compounds have potential as anti-inflammatory therapeutics. .

    \nResearchers at Prof. Ogle’s System Regeneration Lab have developed a novel bioink composition that supports 3D printing of biological structures. Creation of biological structures that functionally and structurally mimic native human
    tissues and organs has been the holy grail of tissue engineering, and 3D bioprinting is being actively investigated as a means to achieve this. One of the critical challenges with bioprinting lies in formulating a bioink composition
    that is both suitable for printing and able to support cell proliferation. This requirement is particularly difficult to achieve when stem cells are to be grown and differentiated within the printed structures. Requirements such as cell
    expansion after printing, timely delivery of differentiation factors, prevention of undesired modifications, and capacity to support cells through the differentiation process, all pose additional challenges. \n\n<br />

    Spinal cord injuries can result in serious, debilitating outcomes including quadriplegia or paraplegia. There is a dire need to identify treatment strategies for this type of nervous tissue damage. Regenerative therapy has focused on
    the use of stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries and all related clinical trials have reported favorable safety profiles. Unfortunately, these same trials have failed to show improvement in patient nerve function. Drs. Leslie Morse
    and Ricardo Battaglino identified dental pulp stem cells as a promising therapeutic and have developed a method to prepare these cells and subsequently used them in rat models of spinal cord injury. These dental stem cells could be
    developed into treatments for patients with nervous tissue injuries.
</p>

<p>
    The researchers found in a rodent model of spinal cord injury, transplantation of dental pulp stem cells into the damaged tissue enhanced recovery through inhibiting apoptosis, preserving neural fibers and differentiating into mature
    oligodendrocytes. Dental pulp stem cells can be derived from permanent teeth and offer a variety of advantages over current stem cell sources:\n

    Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic, incurable disease affecting 1.5 million Americans with an estimated 40,000 new cases each year. Healthcare associated expenses and lost income due to T1D is estimated at $14 billion annually. T1D is
    treated with regular administration of insulin, however the rising cost of insulin has led patients to ration treatment with devastating effects. 1 in 4 patients have reported cost-related insulin underuse resulting in poor glycemic
    control. Consequently, premature deaths related to such non-adherence are on the rise. T1D results from an autoimmune response in which the body attacks its own insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells. As a result, the pancreas cannot
    produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. This can cause complications ranging from blindness, kidney failure to early death.
</p>
,
<p>
    Researchers at the University of Minnesota seeking to find new interventions for diabetes identified serpin B13 proteinase inhibitor as a potential target for diabetes treatment. The scientists developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb)
    targeting serpin B13 (clone B29) that shows promise as a novel treatment strategy for T1D. When administered to diabetes prone mice, the antibody reduces the number of inflammatory cells (associated with an auto-immune response) and
    leads to increased proliferation of beta cells in the animals. This approach is particularly promising as a human therapeutic since studies in humans have shown that natural serpin B13 autoantibodies are associated with positive
    outcomes in T1D. Instructively, high levels of serpin B13 autoantibodies were correlated with lower risk for T1D. Building on the efficacy observed with the mouse mAb, it is anticipated that a humanized version of the antibody will
    prevent immunogenic effects while offering therapeutic relief.
</p>
,
<p>
    Due to its ability to reduce inflammation and induce tissue regeneration, this novel humanized mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting serpin B13 may also prove therapeutic for inflammatory and/or central nervous system diseases

    This technology encompasses novel vaccine adjuvants with limited systemic exposure. The development of vaccines based on antigen subunits have been plagued by struggles with inducing the necessary T-cell response to confer protection
    while maintaining minimal toxicity. This technology overcomes these challenges using a two-pronged approach. First, the use of novel agonists for TLR7 and TLR8 trigger a prominent T-cell response. Second, conjugation of these agonists
    to a biomolecule that is trafficked to lymph nodes elicits focused immunostimulation. The sum product is a covalent conjugate that is “immune silent” until it travels to the lymph node where it is unmasked, leading to potent adjuvantic
    effects with negligible systemic exposure.
</p>
,
<p>
    Due to their ability to stimulate strong T-cell responses, TLR7 and TLR8 agonists have been prime targets for development as adjuvants. Unfortunately, their propensity to diffuse out of the vaccination site and cause systemic exposure
    and toxicity has been a major drawback. This technology identified novel TLR7/TLR8 stimulating compounds (C2-phenolic imidazoquinoline derivatives) and conjugated them to Hyaluronic Acid (HA) for targeting to lymph nodes. Other
    technologies have attempted similar lymph node delivery, but the strategies or compounds employed to do so are often incredibly complex. HA as a natural biopolymer is optimal for this purpose, with ideal biodegradability,
    biocompatibility and an excellent clinical track record. HA also serves to mask the reactive portions of the agonists and the adjuvant remains unreactive until it is delivered to the target lymphoid tissue and unmasked.

    Base editing is an exciting new genome engineering technology. C-to-T mutations in genomic DNA have been achieved using ribonucleoprotein complexes comprised of rat APOBEC1 single-stranded DNA deaminase, Cas9 nickase (Cas9n), uracil DNA
    glycosylase inhibitor (UGI), and guide (g)RNA. Here, we report the first real-time reporter system for quantification of APOBEC-mediated base editing activity in living mammalian cells. The reporter expresses eGFP constitutively as a
    marker for transfection or transduction, and editing restores functionality of an upstream mCherry cassette through the simultaneous processing of two gRNA binding regions that each contain an APOBEC-preferred 5\'TCA target site. Using
    this system as both an episomal and a chromosomal editing reporter, we show that human APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B base editing complexes are more efficient than the original rat APOBEC1 construct. We also demonstrate coincident enrichment of
    editing events at a heterologous chromosomal locus in reporter-edited, mCherry-positive cells. The mCherry reporter also quantifies the double-stranded DNA cleavage activity of Cas9, and may therefore be adaptable for use with many
    different CRISPR systems. The combination of a rapid, fluorescence-based editing reporter system and more efficient, structurally defined DNA editing enzymes broadens the versatility of the rapidly expanding toolbox of genome editing
    and engineering technologies.

    <i>Bordetella pertussis</i> (<i>Bp</i>) is the bacterial agent of pertussis (whooping cough) in humans. Current acellular pertussis vaccines, which target only a narrow range of<i> Bp</i> virulence factors, lack efficacy in preventing
    respiratory tract colonization or disease transmission. <i>Bp</i> cell surface iron receptors are essential for the uptake of iron and are critical for growth in the host. New methods targeting <i>Bp</i> iron receptors have the
    potential to improve pertussis vaccine efficacy. Receptor-based vaccines would elicit the production of antibodies that could block iron uptake, starving <i>Bp</i> for iron and thus preventing growth. Further, they could enhance immune
    recognition of <i>Bp</i> for elimination by the host immune\nsystem.
</p>
,
<p>This technology uses <i>Bp</i> receptor proteins required for the uptake of iron sources:</p>
,
<p>
    This approach targets iron receptor proteins essential for growth, instead of virulence factors that are dispensable. <i>Bp</i> iron receptor proteins are recognized by the immune system, and adding these proteins (or regions of those
    proteins) to a vaccine formulation stimulates the immune system to target those receptors. This effectively prevents <i>Bp</i> bacteria from obtaining the iron necessary to live and multiply, and improves immune recognition for
    clearance. Both acellular pertussis vaccines and whole cell pertussis vaccines (used in many countries) could benefit. In addition, the technology can be applied to veterinary vaccines for diseases caused by other
    <i>Bordetella</i> species, such as canine kennel cough, feline bordetellosis or atrophic rhinitis.

    Harmless, common bacteria have been engineered to destroy antibiotic-resistant microbial biofilms such as <i>Pseudomonas\naeruginosa</i> infections (associated with cystic fibrosis, burn wounds, prosthetic implants, pneumonia,
    cellulitis, and sepsis). This technology uses a strain of <i>Lactococcus lactis</i>, a common probiotic bacterium found in many fermented foods as well as the human body. The strain is engineered to specifically target
    <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and acts as a microbial “drone” that binds to the biofilm and secretes enzymes that destroy the biofilm’s structure. The concept, which employs surface display technology that enables the probiotic bacterium to
    non-covalently bind to biofilm structures of choice, can be adapted to target other biofilm/bacteria and to express different enzymes and/or antimicrobial therapeutics.
</p>
,
<p>
    While antibiotics are the standard treatment for biofilm-associated infections, they have relatively little effect against such\ninfections. Newer enzymatic and bacteriophage therapies have shown some efficacy, but this new technology
    is expected to be more effective than existing treatments and with fewer side effects. The microbial “drone” is potentially much more effective than antibiotics and costs substantially less to produce (due in part to requiring less
    purification, concentration and extraction) than therapies using enzymes and bacteriophage. By providing a localized dose of therapy to a site of interest, the drone can provide a more effective and concentrated dose while minimizing
    off target effects of systematic treatment (e.g., antibiotic induced <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infections). Furthermore, the host bacterium is unique in that it is a probiotic with no known issues of immunogenic responses in humans,
    and which offers additional immunomodulatory benefits unrelated to the design.

    A promising technology uses radiofrequency (RF) excited biocompatible magnetic nanoparticles (mNPs) to safely and uniformly thaw large-volume cryopreserved tissue samples without devitrification, associated ice damage or cryoprotectant
    toxicity. By evenly distributing mNPs throughout a sample and applying excitation fields (alternating magnetic fields), the mNPs heat up very quickly (hundreds of °C/minute) and can evenly thaw larger biomaterials with less risk of
    damage to tissue.
</p>

<p>
    Keeping samples vitrified (in an ice-free, vitreous state) during cooling lessens potential damage from ice crystal formation.\nHowever, during thawing problems can arise, such as uneven heating, devitrification (ice crystallization) or
    cracking of the sample. While smaller samples like cells or thin tissues are less prone to such problems, larger samples are far more susceptible. Using higher-molarity cryoprotectant solutions helps prevent crystallizing during
    freezing, but as the molarity of such solutions increases, so does the potential toxicity to tissues. This new technology aims to keep tissues viable by uniformly heating samples while also reducing toxicity to them.

    A new method and tool have been developed for the genetic therapy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and related genetic disorders. The dystrophin gene sequence has been genetically corrected by inserting a synthetic exon transcript
    into the gene code prior to the first exon in the natural coding sequence. The inserted construct ends in a stop signal that keeps transcription of mutated exons from occurring, and is able to successfully code for dystrophin. The
    inserted synthetic exons bypass the mutated genes and allows for stronger muscle tissue and reversal of muscular dystrophy to occur. This method may also be a viable option for treatment in similar genetic disorders, where the exons
    that cause the disease are spread out across the megabase.
</p>
,
<p>
    DMD is a recessive genetic disorder that causes muscle degeneration and eventual death through a mutation that makes the body unable to code for the protein dystrophin. In healthy bodies, dystrophin is an integral component to the
    structure of muscle tissue, and the lack of this protein causes the muscles to break down. Researchers have\npreviously found the specific exons in the genetic code that are responsible for the production of dystrophin, and it is known
    that it is the mutation of these exons that causes the genetic issues related to DMD. However, the exons\nare spread across the megabase of the human genome, and it is therefore difficult to correct the DMD locus. There has been little
    success in genetic treatments to correct the mutation responsible for the protein coding error that causes DMD.

    variation introduced by sample handling, sample loading \nand instrument response. PIN uses relative, rather than global scaling factors \nto achieve this aim, eliminating extraneous artifacts.
</p>
,
<p>
    Using PIN reduces the coefficient of variation by \nmore than 50% (compared with 9-25% for current methods) and the Pooled Estimate \nVariance (PEV) by 69-78% (compared with 9-38% for current methods). The result \nof using PIN is that
    complex peptide mixtures with statistically significant \nbiological variation are observed which are often missed by conventional \nnormalization techniques. Potential applications include biomarker discovery, \npharmaceutical studies
    and personalized medicine.

    A drug delivery system that requires \nfewer treatments can improve patient compliance. Many treatments of \nacute to chronic diseases require multiple injections to be administered\n to maintain drug levels. Patient compliance is
    difficult to achieve if \nthe patient has to return to the clinic multiple times or has to \nadminister injections at home. Polymers with controlled drug release \ncould be a solution to this treatment hurdle. If these treatments can
    be\n given in a single injection that lasts days to weeks, the success rate \nof the treatment will increase.

    Electronic light detectors can be used to image and/or map biological samples and for DNA chip analysis. In contrast to \nconventional biological imaging techniques, this method scans across the sample and detects multiple images
    constructed from light emitted by the biological sample. The detector may be a linear charged-couple device (CCD) which gathers slices of the sample to be combined electronically into the full image. The light emitted from the sample
    may include light generated by the sample itself, including chemi-luminescence, fluorescence adsorption and quenching.

    Lantibiotics are peptide-based antimicrobial compounds produced by several types of bacteria that inhibit other closely-related bacteria. The most common lantibiotic exhibits a wide range of effectiveness against most Gram-positive
    bacteria, supporting its common use in extending shelf life. However, this lantibiotic is ineffective in preventing the growth of Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. The researchers at the University of Minnesota have
    discovered a lantibiotic from a culture of Bifidobacterium longum, a dominant species in the human intestines. This lantibiotic is the first bacteriocin described to date to have natural bactericidal and inhibitory action against both
    Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including E.coli and Salmonella.
</p>
,
<p>
    The technology relates to an isolated lantibiotic that is bactericidal to both <strong>Gram-negative</strong> and <strong>Gram-positive</strong> microbes, especially in conditions which do not damage the outer membrane of these
    microbes. Given that the enzymatic activities of gram-negative bacteria, particularly <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>E. coli</em>, are responsible for widespread contamination, safety recalls, and consumer illness, the technology has the
    potential to eliminate the bacterial threats presented by these and other pathogens. This inhibition and elimination of the bacterial threat can extend shelf life in a variety of food products including dairy, eggs, canned meat, and
    canned seafood. It can be used as a food preservative, probiotic and dietary supplement to inhibit a wider variety of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in foods such as deli meats as compared to current lantibiotics. It is a natural
    preservative that can displace artificial chemical preservatives, giving appeal to foods as \'safe\' and \'nutritious\' and can be labeled as \'contains no preservatives\'. As a product of <em>Bifidobacterium longum</em>, the peptide
    has been sequenced, partially purified, and partially characterized and is on the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) list.

    The Sarcoma miRNA Expression Database (S-MED) provides comprehensive information about microRNA expression patterns in sarcomas and other relevant cancer tissue types, helping the diagnosis, classification, prognosis, and treatment of
    malignant tumors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small RNAs regulating expressed genes in human sarcomas, can assist in the development of cancer treatments. However, miRNA expression patterns in sarcomas are poorly understood and no
    central information resource exists. The Sarcoma miRNA Expression Database addresses this gap by systematically providing comprehensive sarcoma miRNA expression profiles. The database is the first of its kind and not available anywhere
    else in the world. The database is web-accessible and provides both basic and advanced search options.
</p>
,
<p>
    The Sarcoma miRNA Expression Database contains the miRNA expression patterns for 310 tissue samples representing 22 sarcoma types. The database replaces frozen tumor tissue samples, the availability of which is a major challenge in
    studying sarcoma miRNA or gene expression patterns. The database also includes experimentally validated unique miRNA expression levels in angiosarcoma and other uncommon sarcomas. In addition, the database includes miRNA expression data
    from normal tissues such as bone, smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle, and from benign tumors such as neurofibroma and leiomyoma for comparative studies with their malignant counterparts. To make the information easy to understand, the
    database uses heat maps to visualize information and color codes to represent data in absolute and relative formats. Each miRNA is linked to the database so that users can easily track its basic information. Statistical details are
    provided, such as fold changes and P-values for differentially expressed miRNAs in each sarcoma type and corresponding normal tissues.
</p>
,
<p>
    DNA microarray studies have identified differentially expressed genes in various sarcomas. Many of these genes are regulated by miRNAs. MiRNAs are non-coding regulatory small RNAs that display tissue and stage specific expression. By
    accelerating the understanding and identification of miRNAs in sarcomas, the Sarcoma miRNA Expression Database facilitates the development of miRNA-based cancer biomarkers for different sarcoma subtypes. These miRNAs can also be used to
    differentiate the stages of the tumors (i.e., primary or metastatic) and the origin of the metastatic tumors. The database facilitates the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of different types of sarcomas, for which very few diagnostic
    markers currently exist.

    MiRNAs were discovered relatively recently and their functions are still being studied. Our lab is the first to study miRNAs in sarcomas using cutting edge ultra high throughput detection procedures. The data in this Sarcoma miRNA
    Expression Database is not available through any other researchers or organizations across the globe. It would be extremely difficult for researchers to independently assemble the tumors in this dataset due to their rarity. The Sarcoma
    MiRNA Expression Database allows users to define the miRNA types or relationships they are interested in studying, instead of being limited by previously analyzed data. This is the first database that allows users across the globe to
    search and view microRNA expression levels in different sarcomas through a web interface.

Multicolor Reporter Cells for Detecting and Quantifying HIV-1," It is estimated that half of new HIV infections in the U.S. are from patients who know they are HIV-positive but underestimate their transmissibility. Identifying and monitoring the latent HIV reservoir in these individuals could inform patient care and significantly reduce the incidence of new infections. Currently, tests for measuring the latent HIV reservoir are difficult to perform, time consuming and expensive. These include the quantitative viral outgrowth assay (Q-VOA). A simple and low-cost alternative could be a gamechanger in global health. "
Porous Silicon Nanomembranes for the Rapid Separation of Macromolecules by Size and Shape," The separation or isolation of proteins from a heterogeneous mixture is a common practice in scientific experimentation and the manufacturing of biologic reagents. Commercially available kits and current laboratory methods to achieve separation are based upon the average size of proteins in solution. This is a limitation when multiple macromolecules of similar calculated mass to a target are present. However, a nanomembrane with openings designed to filter specific structural shapes would allow, for instance, the separation of proteins beyond just their size and molecular weight. In addition, such nanomembranes have utility for the separation of other molecular structures possessing differences in shape as a result of genetic mutation. This includes some cancerous or pathogenic variants such as the pathogen responsible for chronic wasting disease (CWD), a prion protein that causes fatal neurological disease in deer, elk, and moose. While normal and pathogenic prions have identical masses, they differ in their structural shapes. The current methods for detecting these prions and CWD are limited by the proteins’ similarities in size often yielding false positives or resulting in delays in the testing process. Nanomembranes able to distinguish cancer markers or pathogenic species from the healthy or benign forms would provide another tool in the arsenal of advanced healthcare, personalized medicine, disease detection, and treatment. "
Noninvasive Assay for Bovine Embryo Quality," Selection intensity for higher milk production in dairy cattle has contributed to a decline in fertility, posing a challenge to dairy producers. Despite technological advances, the pregnancy rate of cows following in vitro fertilization (IVF) is only 45 percent, with increased risk for abortion and stillbirth. Conventionally, assessment of the quality and potential of embryos produced in vitro is largely based on morphology. However, morphologically similar embryos differ in developmental capacity likely due to underlying genetics. Moreover, the process is subjective and requires invasive sampling of the embryo and parental tissue.  There is clear and commercial opportunity for a noninvasive method that supports the efficient selection of high quality embryos. Such a method would improve the odds of successful IVF procedures, saving tens of thousands of dollars and reducing failed pregnancies. "
Blood Protein Biomarkers for Detection of Colon Cancer," Colorectal cancer is a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality in developed nations, causing more than 600,000 deaths worldwide every year. While early detection of localized colorectal cancer often leads to complete cure by polypectomy or surgery, methods for early detection are limited in sensitivity and specificity, have low patient adherence to screening recommendations and place a strain on the capacity of clinical gastroenterologists. The current recommended screening procedures (e.g., colonoscopy, CT scan, Fecal Occult Blood Test or Exact Science's Cologuard stool test) can be non-specific, insensitive for the earliest operable lesions, are highly invasive or involve the patient handling stool specimens, which can also lead to low patient compliance. By contrast, a detection modality based on blood or serum samples may achieve much broader patient compliance and clinical coverage. "
Predicting Glucoregulatory Dysfunction," The term glucoregulatory dysfunction covers a spectrum of disorders from insulin resistance to prediabetes and diabetes. Problems associated with glucoregulatory dysfunction and obesity dominate health care costs in the U.S. today. The test used to identify glucoregulatory dysfunction (based on high blood glucose levels or glycosylated hemoglobin) works after the fact, i.e., it confirms the problem rather than initially detecting it. A better test, one that could be used to screen at-risk patients before they progress to a more serious condition, would enable earlier intervention and improved patient outcomes. "
Enhanced Endotoxin Detection: New Advantages in Liquid Crystal Assays for Gram-Negative Pathogens," Gram-negative bacterial infections are an ongoing challenge to health care providers worldwide. Detection, treatment and control of such pathogens have gained increasing importance in the context of antimicrobial resistance and emerging infectious disease. The LAL (Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate) assay, derived from the horseshoe crab, is typically used to detect the presence of Gram-negative bacteria and remains the only FDA-approved approach. While effectively detecting lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or lipid A (endotoxins present on membranes of Gram-negative bacteria) with a high degree of sensitivity, this complex, expensive assay is susceptible to low endotoxin recovery (LER) causing false positive and negative results in the presence of masking agents (e.g., buffers surfactants, cations, proteins, chelating agents and nucleic acids).  UW–Madison researchers previously developed a faster, more sensitive and less expensive method utilizing liquid crystals (LCs). LC droplets in an aqueous solution indicate the presence of endotoxin with a readily observable change in configuration from bipolar (two point defects) to radial (one point defect). This structural change allows for the detection of endotoxins at concentrations as low as 1 picogram per milliliter. "
Field Test for Mycobacterial Infections," Mycobacterial infections cause major health problems for people and animals, including human tuberculosis, bovine tuberculosis and Johne’s disease. Johne’s disease (or paratuberculosis) afflicts 91 percent of dairy herds in the U.S. and costs the industry an estimated $500 million every year. Bovine tuberculosis, which is caused by a different subspecies of the bacteria, is endemic in dairy herds and a threat to wildlife in many developed countries including the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Current diagnostic tests miss the early stages of infection and cannot differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (the DIVA principle). Early and reliable detection is imperative to control the infection in herds. "
Identification of Disease Characteristics Using Isotope Ratios in Breath, UW-Madison researchers previously described a method of determining whether or not an animal is suffering from a catabolic change by sampling isotope changes in breath or blood. 
Biomarkers for Detecting Prostate Cancer," Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in American men, causing more than 27,000 deaths every year. An estimated one man in seven will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime. Early detection is critical but today’s screening methods (prostate specific antigen or PSA testing, and digital rectal exam) are far from perfect. For example, PSA tests often detect non-significant cancers, leading to an estimated 50 percent of overdiagnoses. Needle biopsy has become the standard to confirm the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but eight to 30 punches may be required. The procedure is invasive, plagued by false negatives (as high as 34 percent) and may have to be repeated multiple times because of sampling errors. The development of an easy and accurate test to augment PSA screening would be of enormous benefit. "
Assay to Determine Risk of Fungal Infection," Fungal infections such as aspergillosis and Valley Fever can be life threatening, particularly in immune-compromised patients. These patients are vulnerable to fungal strains that flourish in hospitals and cost many thousands of dollars to treat. Currently there is no vaccine against fungi despite the escalating risk of infection and death. However, there is hope. UW–Madison researchers have developed a potential vaccine that could prevent infection by many strains of pathogenic fungi (see WARF reference number P130116US02). The new vaccine contains calnexin – a protein found in fungi and other eukaryotes – and could help a patient’s immune system recognize and combat infection. Building on their work, the researchers are now developing a way to determine the immune response of patients who may have a fungal infection. The ability to check immunity has important applications in human and veterinary medicine. "
Detecting Ovarian Cancer and Risk," Ovarian cancer is the most fatal gynecological cancer, killing 15,000 women in the Unites States every year. The overall five-year relative survival rate for women with ovarian cancer is 46 percent. The survival rate improves to 93 percent if the cancer is diagnosed early. Sadly, a fraction of cases are diagnosed at this curable stage.  Early diagnosis of ovarian cancer can be accomplished by measuring biomarkers in blood or urine. The most widely studied serum marker for ovarian cancer is CA125. Unfortunately, CA125 levels are elevated in only half of women with stage 1 disease. Also, screening is expensive and can lead to false positives and unnecessary surgeries.  There is great interest in finding new biomarkers that could help detect ovarian cancer at a curable stage. "
Diagnostic Kit for Blastomycosis," Blastomyces dermatitidis is a soil fungus found throughout the world, and is especially prevalent in the river valleys and Great Lakes region of the United States. If spores are inhaled, blastomycosis can develop in the lungs, leading to pneumonia-like symptoms and other diseases. Dogs are particularly vulnerable to infection and early treatment is essential.  A variety of techniques have been used for diagnosing blastomycosis. However, these clinical tests suffer from potential false positives due to cross-reactivity with common fungal antigens. One approach to reduce false positives is to use BAD-1, a protein unique to B. dermatitidis, as a biomarker for detecting infection. But isolating the protein has traditionally relied on recombinant methods, using histidine tags or other capture means.  A better approach would aid cheaper and more sensitive testing. "
Simple Test for Diagnosing Antibody-Mediated Rejection in Patients with a Kidney Transplant," Almost 90,000 Americans develop end-stage renal disease each year.  Kidney transplantation is the best therapy for these patients and offers them an improved quality of life.    Although many kidney grafts are successful in the short term, long-term maintenance of the grafts is poor.  A primary cause of transplant failure is cell-mediated rejection (CMR).  Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), which affects 10 to 15 percent of patients, has emerged as another important cause of graft damage and eventual loss.  Unlike other forms of rejection, AMR frequently is irreversible.  Early diagnosis and monitoring of AMR could allow physicians to make informed decisions about anti-rejection therapies, but no inexpensive, single, straightforward test for conclusively diagnosing AMR is available currently. "
One-Step DNA Extraction from Dried Blood Spots for Newborn Screening," Newborn screening is the practice of testing newborns for certain harmful or potentially fatal disorders that are not otherwise apparent at birth. Generally, blood drops are obtained from the heel, finger or ear and then absorbed onto filter paper to produce a dried blood spot collection card. The dried blood spots then are tested for a variety of individual diseases and conditions, including those of metabolic, genetic or hormonal origin. This testing saves millions of dollars each year in health care costs for people who would suffer the long-term effects of these disorders if not treated upon birth. Many of the tests measure enzymes or metabolites in the blood by immunoreaction or tandem mass spectrometry. However, with the growing number of identified DNA biomarkers for genetic disorders, isolating DNA from the dried blood spots is increasingly desirable. But the isolation of DNA from dried blood samples is a laborious process involving multiple buffers and multiple pipetting and aspiration steps and is not amenable to a high throughput format and automation. In addition, blood can contain contaminants that can interfere with subsequent analysis steps. DNA quality is particularly important in the analysis of single copy number genes for which the signal-to-noise ratio is significant. Improved methods for the rapid, low cost extraction of DNA from blood samples are needed. "
Monoclonal Antibodies That Recognize Recombinant Mengovirus 3C Proteinase, Mengovirus is a picornavirus that causes encephalomyocarditis in humans and other animals. 
Monoclonal and Polyclonal Antibodies Raised to Recombinant Mengovirus 3D Polymerase, Mengovirus is a picornavirus that causes encephalomyocarditis in humans and other animals. 
Early Detection of Hemangiosarcoma and Angiosarcoma," Of the approximately 65 million domestic dogs in the United States, between 1.5 and 2.5 million will contract canine hemangiosarcoma, an incurable tumor of the cells that line blood vessels. Death usually results from acute internal hemorrhage following rupture of the tumor. Treatment is ineffective because the disease is diagnosed at a late stage when tumors are resistant to chemotherapy, and no method of early diagnosis currently exists. "
Prostate Cancer and Melanoma Screening," Almost 200,000 men in the United States develop prostate cancer each year. More than 60,000 people develop melanoma. Early diagnosis is key to survival because the best treatment and prognosis for these diseases depends on early detection. However, diagnostic procedures, such as biopsies or imaging tests, are often invasive and uncomfortable. "
Method and Compositions for Detecting Botulinum Neurotoxin," Botulinum neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum are the most potent toxins known. Because of the threat of bio-terrorism, sensitive methods for detecting botulinum neurotoxin are needed; however, current detection methods are expensive, time-consuming and complicated. "
hMREII Antiserum for the Detection of DNA Damage," DNA damage occurs in organisms as a result of exposure to environmental chemicals and radiation. Failure to repair this damage can lead to tumor formation and cancer. Although a gene has been found in yeast that blocks meiotic recombination and confers profound sensitivity to double-strand break DNA damage, a human equivalent has not been found. "
Application of NADH Cytochrome B5 Reductase/System for Direct Metabolism of Xenobiotics," The NADH cytochrome b5 reductase/cytochrome b5 system can transfer electrons to other enzymes, including those involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, toxins and drugs. In the past, NADH cytochrome b5 reductase has been considered a “helper” enzyme, with no direct role in drug metabolism. "
Eight Hybridoma Cell Lines Producing Monoclonal Antibodies Against La Crosse Encephalitis Virus," La Crosse virus is an etiologic agent for childhood encephalitis in North America. Structurally, the nucleocapsid of this virus is enclosed by a host-derived lipid envelope holding two virion glycoproteins, G1 and G2. These proteins are believed to be responsible for attachment of the virus to cells. Although several researchers had been successful at producing specific monoclonal antibodies against the larger G1, production of a monoclonal antibody directed against the G2 viral protein has not been reported. "
Novel Assay for Measuring Stress-Induced CREB Phosphorylation," CREB is a transcription factor that has been implicated as a critical regulator of neuronal function and survival. Knockout mice lacking CREB exhibit a disease similar to ataxia telangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disease primarily seen in children that is characterized by neurodegeneration, extreme sensitivity to UV and ionizing radiation and high susceptibility to cancers. "
DNA Encoding a DNA Repair Protein," Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, immunodeficiency, higher incidence of cancer, cell cycle defects and radiation sensitivity. "
White Blood Cell Assay for Determining Risk of Sepsis and Other Inflammatory Disorders," Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to infection that often leads to low blood pressure, organ failure, and death. Components of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls, such as endotoxin, are a potent trigger of sepsis, and high levels of endotoxin in the blood cause many of its symptoms. The nucleotide receptor P2X7 likely modulates the response of macrophages to endotoxins and may be an indicator of sepsis. "
"Polyplex Delivery System for Proteins, Nucleic Acids and Complexes"," With an increasing interest in using the CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene editing, there comes a strong need to develop tools for delivering the CRISPR machinery safely and efficiently into cells. Existing non-viral strategies may suffer from one or more disadvantages including high cytotoxicity, poor in vivo stability, large particle size, lack of cell/tissue targeting delivery and variable loading of gene editing machinery. These hurdles continue to limit the ability to fully explore new clinical applications for CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, especially in living organisms. "
Nanocapsule Delivery System for Ribonucleoproteins," With the explosion of interest in using the CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene editing, there is a strong focus on developing tools for delivering the CRISPR machinery safely and efficiently into cells. Existing non-viral strategies may suffer from high cytotoxicity, poor in vivo stability, large particle size, lack of cell/tissue targeting ability, and variable loading of gene editing machinery. These hurdles have created a significant bottleneck, limiting the progress in generating new research tools and new clinical applications for CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, especially in living organisms. "
Engineered Probiotics as Systemic Therapeutic Delivery Platform," Polypeptides, such as enzymes, antibodies, hormones and cytokines, are useful therapeutic agents. However, routes for systemically introducing such polypeptides to a subject are limited. Oral administration typically is not feasible, as the polypeptides are either degraded in the gastrointestinal tract or are blocked from reaching the bloodstream. Direct intravenous administration is therefore the major route by which polypeptides are systemically introduced.  Certain types of genetically engineered bacteria have been used as vehicles for locally delivering polypeptides to various tissues and even tumors. However, systemic distribution is potentially deleterious in certain subject populations such as immunocompromised patients.  Needed are engineered bacteria capable of being administered into the gastrointestinal tract and delivering polypeptides into the bloodstream – without systemic levels of the bacteria themselves being increased. "
Rat Model of Alexander Disease," Alexander disease (AxD) is a rare disease of the central nervous system characterized by formation of protein aggregates within astrocytes and disruption of growth or maintenance of the myelin sheath. The cause of the disease has been traced to the gene encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Since the initial discovery of GFAP as the genetic basis for the disease, reported by the Messing laboratory in 2001, several types of AxD models have been developed, including animals. Using these models, significant progress has been made in the development of novel treatments.  Some of these therapeutics are now ready for more rigorous testing in animals – a necessary step prior to the initiation of clinical trials in human patients. However, the existing mouse models are not ideal for this testing. While they display several key features of the human disease, such as hallmark pathological protein aggregates and subtle evidence of subclinical seizures and cognitive deficits, they have no evident disruption in the myelin sheath or any problems with strength or gait.  Overall, the mouse phenotype is very mild and offers little opportunity to test the effects of rescue by experimental treatments. Better animal models are needed for drug development. "
S1mplex: A New Tool for Precision Gene Editing," New tools for human gene editing are rapidly advancing all sectors of biomedicine from basic biology to somatic gene therapy in the clinic. Precise editing of DNA sequences in the human genome can be used to correct mutations or introduce novel genetic functionality for many biomedical purposes. Currently, nonviral delivery of preformed CRISPR ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) is being developed for somatic gene editing applications.  Writing specific DNA sequences into the human genome is challenging with nonviral gene-editing reagents, since most of the edited sequences contain various imprecise insertions or deletions. Faithful writing of DNA – or scarless gene editing – within human cells remains an outstanding challenge, and improved strategies are sought. "
Blood-Brain Barrier Model," Accurately reproducing the blood-brain barrier in an in vitro setting has been a longstanding challenge. Current methods require the independent isolation of multiple cell types, and the quality of these preparations varies. "
"An Injectable Nanovehicle for a Cancer Treatment Combination of Paclitaxel, Rapamycin and 17-AAG"," Two-drug combinations of paclitaxel and rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor) as well as paclitaxel and 17-AAG (an enhanced version of geldanamycin and Hsp90 inhibitor) have progressed into human clinical trials for cancer therapy. UW-Madison researchers have discovered that paclitaxel, rapamycin and 17-AAG exert synergistic anticancer activity against breast cancer cells. They also have discovered that nontoxic, nanoscale poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(lactic acid), or PEG-b-PLA, micelles surprisingly can take up all three cancer drugs, enabling the simple, safe, sterile and synergistic delivery of this three-drug combination, as opposed to conventional vehicles that are toxic, incompatible and require sequential drug administration. "
Research Tool for Protein Conformation Analysis," The three-dimensional structure of proteins can be studied in solution using various methods of covalent and noncovalent labeling in which the readout is accomplished by mass spectrometry (MS). These procedures, collectively known as protein ‘footprinting,’ all involve measuring the solvent accessibility of either the peptide backbone (hydrogen deuterium exchange) or amino acid side chains (covalent modification and cross linking reagents). After labeling, proteins are analyzed using tandem MS and linkages or adducts are quantitatively mapped to specific regions, revealing areas and degrees of intermolecular interactions or solvent accessibility.  The emergence of the quickly expanding protein therapeutics industry has generated a need for easy, sensitive and reproducible methods for detecting changes in protein conformation as part of the rigorous quality control process required for clinical use and for quickly detecting the regions of proteins involved in their binding to ligands and/or protein-protein interactions. "
Genetic Testing for Acquired Peripheral Neuropathy in Dogs," Peripheral neuropathies are a diverse group of diseases marked by degeneration of the peripheral nervous system. These diseases affect both humans and animals. In humans, the most common form is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), which affects about 1 in 2,500 people. Current treatments for CMT manage symptoms rather than modify the disease course. One barrier to developing new and better treatments is the lack of a large animal model. A related disease called acquired peripheral neuropathy (APN) syndrome is common in certain dog breeds. This condition is also referred to as laryngeal paralysis. Labrador retrievers (the most common dog breed in the United States) represent about 70 percent of APN cases, although other breeds can be affected including golden retrievers, poodles and Irish setters. To date, no genetic test for the disease is commercially available. A diagnostic test to predict the likelihood that a patient – human or canine – will exhibit peripheral neuropathy in their lifetime would be of significant value. "
Reagents for Bioreversible Protein Esterification," Chemoselective transformations are of key importance in modern chemical biology. Protein esterification can, for example, be employed for labeling, enhanced cellular uptake and other useful protein modifications. For this reason methods and reagents for selective esterification of carboxyl groups in proteins/polypeptides are of particular interest, especially if the reactions can be carried out in buffered aqueous solution and do not require a catalyst. While there has been some success in this space, there remains a need for more efficient chemoselective esterification reagents for proteins and other biological molecules (e.g., nucleic acids) that result in high-yield, bioreversible ester formation. Such reagents should be synthetically amenable to modification with biologically useful entities. "
Enhanced Drug Delivery Across the Blood-Brain Barrier: pH-Dependent Antibodies Targeting the Transferrin Receptor," Drug delivery to the brain is hampered by the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which excludes more than 98 percent of small molecule pharmaceuticals and nearly 100 percent of all protein and gene therapeutics.  One promising delivery method involves antibodies that target receptor-mediated systems at the BBB. Drug molecules can be attached to the antibodies and transported into brain tissue. Antibodies that target the transferrin and insulin receptor systems currently are available, but these systems are expressed throughout the body, leading to the mistargeting of expensive pharmaceuticals.  Nevertheless, the transferrin receptor (TfR) presents a valuable therapeutic target both on normal and cancerous cells, and can be antagonized directly or exploited indirectly as an intracellular drug delivery vector. Needed in the field is an antibody with pH-sensitive binding capability; this would enable the antibodies to bind TfR at physiological pH and release rapidly at endosomal pH. "
Phage-Cured Lactobacillus Strains for Therapeutic Delivery," In addition to key roles in food and biofuel production, probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria are being exploited in medicine as therapeutic delivery vehicles. One obstacle is that bacteriophages pervasive in the lactobacilli genome can be induced/reactivated as a result of various environmental (stress) factors, which compromises viability and robustness. Several methods have been developed to delete phages from bacterial genomes in vitro, including treatment with ultraviolet light and the chemotherapy drug mitomycin C. But these approaches are known to damage DNA and cause mutations. Furthermore, these approaches generally do not make the strains resistant to future bacteriophage incorporation in the genome. "
Recombinant Rhinovirus A16 for Human Inoculation Studies," Human inoculum strains of rhinoviruses have been used for more than 50 years to induce experimental colds to study disease mechanisms and to test the efficacy of antiviral drugs. Traditional inocula are obtained from the nasal secretions of patients with common cold symptoms, and require extensive safety testing of both the virus and the volunteer to exclude extraneous pathogens. This process can be challenging given the many potential contaminants, and because new viruses and infectious agents continue to be discovered. "
Animal Model of Brittle Bone Disease," Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) or brittle bone disease is an incurable genetic disorder that causes fragile bones and a lifetime of breaks and fractures. Recently, mutations in the gene for bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) were reported in two recessive OI families. BMP1 and a closely related proteinase called mammalian tolloid-like 1 (TLL1) are coexpressed in various tissues including bone, and have overlapping activities related to collagen development. Studying the in vivo roles of theses genes in bones and other tissues could lead to greater understanding of OI and possible therapeutic interventions. Until now, early lethality of BMP1- and TLL1-null mice has precluded the use of such models. "
Photoreceptor Scaffold for In Vitro Modeling and Transplantation Therapy," Photoreceptors are specialized cells that capture and convert light into signals that can be processed by the retina and visual centers of the brain. Supportive cells called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) grow adjacent to the photoreceptors and are critical to their health and function. All blinding disorders of the outer retina involve dysfunction and eventual degeneration of the photoreceptors, either alone (e.g., retinitis pigmentosa) or involving the RPE (e.g., age-related macular degeneration or AMD).  Currently, these patients have limited treatment options. One broadly applicable strategy would be to replace photoreceptors (alone or in combination with RPE). To date the only approved pluripotent stem cell-based clinical trials underway in humans involve transplantation of RPE cells alone (via bolus injection or on planar scaffolds). While representing an important advance, transplanting RPE alone will not rescue vision in advanced disease when photoreceptors have been lost. Furthermore, existing technologies cannot recapitulate the precise spatial orientation and polarization of photoreceptors required for proper function. "
Rhinovirus-C Peptide for Development of Vaccines and Antivirals," Human rhinoviruses (species A, B and C) are responsible for the majority of upper respiratory tract infections (like the common cold) and many infections of the lower respiratory tract as well. Rhinovirus C species (RV-C) was discovered in 2006 and is of special interest because it can cause more severe illnesses in children and is closely associated with asthma exacerbations. However, no vaccines or effective antiviral treatments for RV-C currently are available. "
Yeast-Based Intein Platform for Drug Production," The therapeutic and biochemical properties of proteins including antibodies can be enhanced by custom chemical functionalization that enables modifications, such as small molecule drug conjugation, PEGylation and conjugation to nanoparticles. Expressed protein ligation (EPL) is one common approach to chemically modify proteins in a site-specific manner. In EPL, the target protein is expressed as a fusion partner to a non-self-cleaving intein such as Mxe GyrA, which is able to excise itself and join the remaining portions. These fusion proteins are most often expressed in E. coli bacteria. However, there are many disadvantages to using bacteria for fusion protein production. Drawbacks include protein refolding, instability and high loss (up to 90 percent) of the intein during expression.  Yeast provide a promising alternative to bacterial expression systems, given their eukaryotic nature and quality control mechanisms. To fully realize the advantages of a yeast-based platform, novel inteins must be developed to increase production. "
Bioreversible Boronates Improve Drug Delivery," The utility of many biologic drugs is limited by inefficient delivery into cells. Strategies to overcome this limitation have included enhancing the attraction between positively charged drug agents and the negatively charged cell surface. Other efforts have focused on natural ligands to target and bind agents to specific receptors on the cell surface. Such methods have been used to deliver pharmaceuticals, proteins, peptides, nucleic acids and other particles into cells. While this has yielded some success, there remains a need for additional delivery strategies. In particular, the ability to bioreversibly modify molecules (i.e., enhance cellular uptake without effecting stability, function or immunogenicity) is highly desirable. "
Small Molecule Catalysts of Oxidative Protein Folding," Approximately 20 percent of human proteins – including many of high pharmaceutical relevance – are believed to contain disulfide bonds critical for proper structure and function. However, producing these proteins by recombinant DNA technology often leads to misfolded aggregates that must be denatured or otherwise treated to ensure proper structure. Because this issue is of significant scientific and commercial interest, systems have been designed to study protein folding. It is known that forming proper disulfide bonds is a slow process, especially for proteins that contain cysteine residues. In human cells, the process is catalyzed by an enzyme called protein disulfide isomerase (PDI).  Adding PDI accelerates the process in vitro but on a larger manufacturing scale is impractical due to high cost and instability. Accordingly, the development of synthetic PDI mimics remains a high priority. "
Enhancing Cell Penetration to Improve Drug Delivery," The utility of many biologic drugs is limited by inefficient cellular delivery. There is a particular need for methods and reagents that facilitate delivery of peptides and proteins into the interior fluid (cytosol) of cells. The vast majority (>90 percent) of biologics that enter a cell’s endosomes fail to reach the cytosol, where they can be of greater value. Until now, there have been few methods for modifying a peptide or protein (that does not naturally enter a cell) to enhance its uptake into the cytosol in a bioreversible manner. Being able to do so has implications for biological research as well as the clinic. For example, dysfunctional proteins could be replaced with functional ones, and misbehaving proteins could be antagonized with specific antibodies. "
New Viral Propagation Method Yields Insight Into Childhood Asthma," In addition to the common cold, human rhinoviruses (RV) trigger nearly half of all cases of asthma exacerbation. Wheezing illnesses in infancy caused by RV are associated with a high risk of developing childhood asthma. While the RV-A and B serotypes propagate readily in typical cell culture systems and are relatively well understood, much less is known about the RV-C serotype because it has not been successfully propagated in any cell type. RV-C strains are associated with up to half of rhinovirus illness in young children, and this failure to grow RV-C in typical cell lines has hindered efforts to develop effective antiviral strategies. "
Adapted Rhinovirus C for Maximum Virus Yield," Human rhinoviruses (species A, B and C) encompass more than 160 types that are responsible for the majority of upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) and many of the lower respiratory tract as well. Rhinovirus C species (RV-C) was discovered in 2006 and is of special interest because it can cause more severe illnesses in children and is closely associated with asthma exacerbations. UW–Madison researchers on the forefront of rhinovirus discovery recently developed an enhanced cell line (HeLa-E8) for propagating the virus in culture (patent applied for; see WARF reference number P140382US02 for more details). To maximize the potential of this discovery, they have worked to identify RV-C mutations that increase replication and virus yields. "
Better Living Through Peptides; Improved Approach to HIV Therapy," Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects over 1.2 million Americans each year, with approximately 50,000 new infections per year. Current treatment includes HIV combination regimens comprising reverse transcriptase, protease and fusion inhibitors, among others. While fusion inhibitors like enfuvirtide interrupt HIV binding to proteins on cell surfaces and prevent entry, such drugs are limited because they rely on constituent alpha amino acids, which deteriorate quickly in the face of proteolysis (protein degradation). As a result, the drug wears off and must be re-administered by injection under the skin. This leads to lowered compliance among patients and increases injection site reactions. Resistance to enfuvirtide is also an ongoing challenge as viruses adapt to repeating alpha peptide residues. "
"Lipid-Free Emulsions for Delivering Anesthesia, Other Hydrophobic Drugs"," Emulsions containing soybean oil have been used intravenously for more than 40 years. Recently they have been employed in the delivery of certain hydrophobic drugs such as anti-inflammatory agents and anesthetics like propofol (i.e., Diprivan). Propofol is used extensively to induce and maintain general anesthesia as well as for sedation purposes. However, the oil used in the emulsion is highly susceptible to bacterial and fungal growth. To combat contamination, tubing and open vials of propofol must be replaced every 12 hours. The current formulation also may cause pain, lipid intolerance and other serious complications in some patients. "
"Methods for Detection, Staging and Surveillance of Colorectal Adenomas and Carcinomas"," In 2016, approximately 135,000 new cases of colon and rectal cancers will be diagnosed and nearly 50,000 will die from this disease, making it the one of the most common causes of cancer related death in the United States. The majority of colon cancers begin as a benign adenomatous polyp and progress to invasive carcinomas through the sequential accumulation of genetic mutations. Biopsies of polyps identified during colonoscopy are evaluated by pathologists who determine if a polyp is cancerous. Patients diagnosed with non-cancerous polyps are monitored over time. The ability to accurately predict the lymph node invasion characteristic of stage 3 remains largely unsolved in the field of colon cancer biology. Currently, lymph node invasion can only be detected reliably by surgical resection and pathologic analysis of the lymph nodes. Accordingly, patients must undergo such surgeries to determine whether their lymph nodes are compromised, rather than only when compromised lymph nodes justify the surgery. And unnecessary surgery is undesirable, as up to 35 percent of colorectal surgery patients suffer from post-operative complications. Researchers at UW–Madison believe that the confident prediction of the presence of lymph node metastasis could reduce the need for invasive surgical procedures and reduce post-operative complications. "
Algorithms to Classify T Cell Activation by Autofluorescence Imaging," The importance of T cells in immunotherapy is driving the development of technologies to better characterize T cells and improve therapeutic efficacy. One specific objective is assessing antigen-induced T cell activation because only functionally active T cells are capable of killing the desired targets. Autofluorescence imaging can assess functional activity of individual T cells in a non-destructive manner by detecting endogenous changes in metabolic co-enzymes such as NAD(P)H. However, recognizing robust patterns of T cell activity is computationally challenging in the absence of exogenous labels or information-rich autofluorescence lifetime measurements. Non-invasive, contrast-agent free determination of T cell behavior is imperative for advancing studies of T cells in vivo and for quality control of clinical adoptive immune transfer procedures (e.g., CAR T cell therapies). "
Method and Device to Screen and Sort Cancer Immunotherapy Cells," A new cancer treatment being studied at a few major centers including UW Health is CAR T (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell) therapy. CAR T therapy uses a patient's own cells and 'reengineers' them to fight cancer. The procedure starts with removing the patient's T cells from the blood and sending them to a lab where they are altered to produce cancer-fighting proteins called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on their surface. These 'supercharged' or activated T cells are multiplied at the lab, and then shipped back to the hospital where they are reinjected into the patient's blood.  Determining T cell activation is imperative for studying these cells in vivo and for quality control of cell therapies like CAR T. Current methods to determine T cell activation (e.g., flow cytometry, cytokine release assay) are either invasive, requiring the use of contrast agents and possibly tissue/cell fixation, or cannot capture population heterogeneity. "
‘Smart’ Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunt," Hydrocephalus is a life-threatening condition caused by abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid within the ventricles of the brain. Typically it is treated through the surgical placement of a shunt system that drains the excess fluid from the brain to another part of the body. Valves positioned within the shunt pathway help regulate flow.  Shunt failure is a very common complication and requires immediate medical attention. A leading cause of failure is partial or complete blockage of the shunt. Blockage may be caused by continuous over-draining. Over time the ability of the tissue to rebound diminishes, causing the tissue to become permanently deformed and lodged within the catheter holes. "
"Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surfaces (SLIPS) with Improved Antifouling Properties, Small Molecule Release"," Slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) are an emerging class of materials with unique antifouling properties and applications ranging from biomedical device coatings and consumer products to industrial equipment.  UW–Madison researchers, led by Prof. David Lynn, developed a method to fabricate SLIPS via the infusion of oils into reactive polymer multilayers (see WARF reference number P150342US02). They have continued to investigate the potential of SLIPS as reservoirs for the controlled release of active agents, with a focus on the design of multifunctional chemical-eluting SLIPS capable of combating pathogens through non-biocidal strategies. "
Liquid Crystal-Based Assay for Rapid and Precise Detection of Endotoxin in the Presence of Masking Agents," Bacterial contamination is a major risk in biologics manufacturing and the presence of endotoxin, an outer membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria, is vigorously tested for in protein and DNA/RNA therapeutics. However, many chelators and surfactants can mask endotoxin during testing. This issue, known as low endotoxin recovery (LER), can lead to regulatory delays, including hold times and post-marketing commitments.  Most current methods for detecting or quantifying endotoxin are based on the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay first developed in the 1960s. These LAL-based methods are complex and expensive and require the use of skilled technicians and biological reagents. Over the last few decades, complementary assays that overcome some of the shortcomings of these methods have been developed, but LER is a newer issue that the LAL assay and current alternatives don't address. "
Modular Peptide Binds to Biomaterials and Promotes New Bone Formation," Musculoskeletal conditions cost an estimated $254 billion each year in the United States, and bone and joint diseases account for half of all chronic conditions in adults over the age of 50. Current clinical bone replacement strategies use synthetic materials to bridge gaps in bone tissue.  Hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings have been shown to enhance bone bonding to implant materials.  However, these coatings typically are unable to actively induce new bone formation.  Emerging approaches for bone repair and replacement therapies have focused on delivering growth factors to skeletal defects, as these biomolecules can induce the formation of bone.  But a practical delivery method has not yet been developed for clinical orthopedic applications. "
Minimally Invasive Microwave Ablation Antennas," Microwave ablation is a minimally invasive method for treating cancer, especially solid tumors. The method uses an interstitial antenna that heats tissue with microwave energy. These antennas require coaxial cables, resulting in unwanted electric currents that flow on the outer conductors of the feeding cables. If not properly suppressed, the currents may damage healthy tissue. The problem typically is addressed with a device called a balun, which uses a hollow circular conductor to encompass the feeding cable.  Baluns increase the overall diameter of an antenna, making it more invasive when inserted into the body. "
Multi-Functional Matrix to Promote Wound Healing and for Other Biomedical Applications," Wound healing is a complex and dynamic process of rebuilding skin and tissue. Chronic or impaired wounds result when tissues fail to progress through the necessary stages of healing. This is a significant clinical problem, affecting 5.7 million patients in the United States and costing an estimated $20 billion each year. According to the CDC, the cost of trauma-related deaths in U.S. is 2.4 times higher than cancer and cardiovascular diseases combined. By 2020, trauma will equal or surpass communicable diseases as the number one cause of disability-adjusted life years worldwide.   The choice of treatment and the development of novel therapeutics depend on the underlying biology and co-morbidity. Although current understanding of many cellular and molecular processes has advanced substantially, efficacy of single agent therapeutics is disappointing and more than 50 percent of wounds remain refractory to conventional treatment. This is partly due to the complex biochemical pathways involved in the dynamic wound healing cascade and the underlying pathology. "
"A Low-Cost, Dosimeter Accessory Kit Enabling the Collection of Accurate Sound Level Measurements from within the Ear Canal"," Noise level in the workplace is a concern and is monitored by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). In many instances, providing some form of hearing protection is an easy solution for most workers subjected to sound exceeding acceptable limits. However, for professions that require the use of two-way communication such as police officers, firefighters and construction workers (all of which have a high level of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL)), obtaining accurate measurements of sound level exposure to provide guidance for proper hearing protection has proven difficult. Currently, a dosimeter worn at shoulder level is used to establish levels of sound workers encounter during their shift. This measurement, though, does not accurately reflect the level of sound traveling to the ear canal. As such, an affordable, portable, and durable attachment that is adaptable to existing dosimeters and capable of measuring the sound level while any ear piece or headset is sending a signal into the ear canal would have significant utility. Such measurements would allow Environmental Health and Safety professionals to make recommendations founded on data, understand individual differences and work habits that would result in NIHL, and inform OSHA regulation development. "
Improved wheelchair design utilizing linear rotary motion with enhanced efficiency and reduced injury and pain for users," According to BCC Research, in 2014 the market for home assistive devices was estimated at $2.26 billion and is expected to reach $2.7 billion by 2020. Of this, the wheelchair and scooter market represent roughly 70% of the total market share with light/ultra-light wheelchairs (including sports wheelchairs) and standard wheelchairs making up 40% of this segment. While the wheelchair manufacturing industry has experienced a decline over the past 5-7 years, factors leading to its anticipated recovery include demographic trends, government and private spending on health, as well as advances in medical technology and healthcare regulations, amongst others. In particular, the aging population is anticipated to have a significant effect on this industry with the number of US residents aged 65 and over estimated to be 55.6 million by 2022. In the US alone, it is estimated that around 3 million people use a manual push rim wheelchair for daily mobility. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of manual wheelchair users will suffer pain and injury in their shoulders, wrists, and hands as a result. While research has shown that lever propulsion systems could go toward reducing such injuries and pain, the industry has not successfully adopted a complete system capable of providing a solution that addresses the full needs of the user. As such, there is a clear and unmet need for the development of an improved wheel-chair design capable of providing better quality of life for wheelchair users. "
Growth Factor Regulation in Blood Products for Improved Wound Healing," Growth factor regulation is a key function of the extracellular matrix and critical for proper blood vessel growth and maturation during wound healing. In particular, blood vessel sprouting is essential for effective healing and dependent on the well-regulated activity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Research has shown that blood vessel sprouting can only occur within a limited VEGF concentration range in vivo. The need to maintain VEGF activity within a particular concentration range during angiogenesis has motivated the search for therapeutic interventions when natural regulation is dysfunctional, such as during diabetic wound healing and tumor growth. Unregulated VEGF activity can result in hemangioma formation and is linked to poor musculoskeletal wound healing, ocular disease and other health concerns. "
More Stable Collagen Mimetic Peptides for Wound Healing," Collagen is the most abundant protein in vertebrates, providing support to virtually every tissue including skin, bone and blood vessel. It is of critical importance in wound healing. Given its significance, collagen has become a common target for biomaterials engineering, spurring the development of synthetic collagen mimetic peptides (CMPs) that imitate its strong triple helix structure. In current practice, CMPs are linked together using a cysteine-cysteine bridge. However, this can cause strain that disrupts proper structural formation. "
Implantable Cancer Drug Delivery Device Signals the Future of Personalized Medicine," Cancer treatment planning remains an ongoing challenge to oncologists and patients alike, with each cancer being genetically unique and requiring personalized approaches. Greater outcome success will depend on highly individualized therapy selection as revealed through genomic profiling. Clinical research demonstrates that localized tumor responses predict the benefit of systemic chemotherapy, reflecting outcomes in metastatic disease. Unfortunately, testing single drugs in vivo often involves systemic administration of drugs to determine patient response. Chemical toxicity remains a concern and is exacerbated by repeated trials of ineffective agents, with in vitro drug testing lacking effectiveness as an alternative. Finding optimal combinations may take several iterations with accompanying patient decline. "
"Digital Otoscope for Optimal Access, Visualization"," An otoscope is a classic handheld medical device that allows doctors to look into the ear canal and tympanic membrane (eardrum). It is used to diagnose ear infections, membrane ruptures and foreign objects. Modern otoscopes are equipped with a camera in the funnel-shaped tip that gets inserted into the ear. However, the design is relatively bulky and unable to visualize past earwax or other obstructions. This means the view is often poor and proper diagnosis is compromised. "
Improved System for Stroke Therapy and Rehabilitation," Each year approximately 780,000 Americans experience a new or recurrent stroke.  Approximately 85 percent of these patients survive and require rehabilitation, making stroke the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S.  The most common treatment for stroke is physical rehabilitation.  Passive movement repetition from the afflicted limb can enable recovery of lost function.  However, physical therapists can reasonably provide only a limited number of repetitions during a session, and also are limited in the number of patients that can be seen for therapy.  Additionally, the recovery can be slow, painstaking and suboptimal.  More automated methods of promoting rehabilitation have been developed, but they generally have been too costly, lack effectiveness or are invasive. "
Detection of the Catabolic State by Determining the Rate of Systemic Oscillations in Carbon Isotope Ratios," The catabolic state refers to the condition where the body uses stores of carbohydrates, amino acids or fats as a source of energy for maintenance. The catabolic state may be induced by infection, disease, external pathogens, toxic chemical exposure, malnutrition or other causes. Early detection of the onset of the catabolic state as an indicator of serious disease has broad applications in human and veterinary health. In sepsis alone, the mortality rate can be cut in half through earlier detection and intervention.  A noninvasive, nondoping, stable isotope method to discern the onset of the catabolic state within minutes was previously developed. The method compares the sampled isotope ratio (C13:C12) to a baseline ratio in the organism by testing changes in exhaled breath samples. That technique uses a comparison specimen to determine the onset of the catabolic state. Other methods to determine if an organism is experiencing a viral or bacterial infection require a baseline measurement from a healthy individual and ongoing measurements over several hours or even days, and can be confounded by the individual’s diet. A need exists for additional methods to determine the catabolic or infected state of an organism and the transition from healthy to sick to enable prompt identification and intervention. "
Minimally Invasive Spinal Fusion," An estimated eight out of 10 people will be affected by a spine condition during their lifetime, making treatment options like spinal fusion surgery imperative. Spinal fusion is a surgical procedure in which vertebrae along the spinal column are fused and immobilized. The procedure can reduce back pain and help treat injuries or deformities. In general, the procedure involves joining two or more vertebrae together using temporary stabilizing hardware (e.g., screws, rods) and bone graft material that provides additional support as the hardware inevitably loosens over time. Presently, inserting a bone graft is a highly invasive process, requiring pulling back the body tissue and laying the graft in by hand. A less intrusive technique could ease patients’ pain, minimize scarring, shorten hospital stays and reduce healthcare costs. "
Combined Keyboard and System for Improved Accessibility to Electronics," Modern public information and transaction machines such as kiosks and automated teller machines (ATMs) frequently employ a touch screen in conjunction with a computer to provide multimedia capabilities intended to help members of the public obtain information or conduct transactions. Despite the advantage of touch screens in such applications, they present a barrier to many people with disabilities. Those with impaired vision may be unable to distinguish the features and virtual “buttons” on the screen. Those unfamiliar with the language or with difficulties reading may not be able to analyze the information on-screen and those with hearing impairments may not be able to analyze audio information. Those with limited mobility may be unable to reach or operate the touch screen surface.  Incorporating accessibility into touch screen systems typically has involved adding buttons, keyboards or mechanical controls to the systems. In many designs, these additions may be limited by a lack of space, expense or other constraints. The EZ Access™ set of design guidelines, techniques and hardware components has been developed previously to provide cross-disability access to people who use information technologies. "
Foot Harness for Patients Relearning to Walk," Walking impairment can be caused by many factors such as aging, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy and other conditions that disrupt balance and posture. Stroke, for example, is the leading cause of severe long-term disability. Retraining patients to walk is a challenging but vital part of recovery, and safety is imperative. "
Improved Neuron Electrode Array Uses Graphene," During electrocorticography (ECoG), electrodes are placed directly on the exposed surface of the brain or spinal cord to record electrical signals. The practice is used to conduct neuroscience research and treat patients afflicted with a variety of neuronal disorders. Small, micro-ECoG devices are especially attractive because they strike a balance between invasiveness and signal quality. However, these devices employ opaque conductive materials that make it impossible to stimulate or image the underlying tissue. Transparent arrays have been fabricated using indium-tin oxide, but this material is brittle, requires high temperature processing and is limited in the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) wavelength ranges often used in neural imaging and optogenetic applications. "
Monitoring Tumor Ablation in Real Time," As an alternative to surgery, thermal ablation is a method of treating tumors of the liver, kidney, lung and other body parts. In the process, a slender antenna or probe is inserted through the skin to drive energy into the tumor, causing cells to heat and die. Ultrasound or other medical imaging typically is used before the probe is turned on (for treatment planning) and after it is turned off (for treatment verification). A more dynamic method would empower clinicians to monitor progress in real time. "
Surgical Manipulator with Finer Motion Control and Capability," Minimally invasive surgeries – including robotic procedures – utilize manipulators, which are inserted into patients to help maneuver tissue or tools. Manipulators can be classified either as rigid-link or flexible continuum devices. Flexible manipulators (such as catheters) often are desirable because they are softer and less likely to damage tissue. For this reason they are popular when safety is paramount, such as intracardiac and vascular interventions. On the other hand, flexibility has drawbacks. Soft compliant structures, in combination with internal friction, can be difficult to position and operate. "
An Orthopedic Implant Coating for Enhanced Bone Growth," ""Orthobiologics"" provides an improved method of treating fractures and other bone defects. This therapy employs inductive molecules, such as bone morphogenetic protein-2 or bone morphogenetic protein-4, to stimulate natural bone growth in defects. The proteins are embedded or adsorbed within collagen sponges, porous ceramic blocks or synthetic polymers and then delivered to the defects.  However, clinical use of orthobiologics technology has been problematic. Carrier materials currently used, such as collagen sponges, to deliver bone growth factors have been inappropriate for orthopedic applications, due at least in part to poor bulk mechanical and degradation properties. Diffusion of growth factors from such carrier materials is not controllable and is released too quickly, leading to rapid degradation in vivo. And new tissue regeneration approaches are not designed to integrate with existing surgical procedures. Improved platforms for delivering inductive molecules in a targeted and controlled fashion are needed before orthobiologics can be widely utilized. "
Novel Respiratory Monitoring with Ultrasound," Despite technological advancements, morbidity and mortality rates remain high in patients under sedation, often due to delayed detection of early respiratory compromise and/or failure. UW–Madison researchers have developed a respiratory monitoring device utilizing doppler ultrasound signals acquired from the patient’s airway and comparing them to baseline parameters, often via a machine learning algorithm. When a threshold change is detected, an alarm is provided to indicate respiratory compromise and/or failure, which can include early airway compromise, airway failure and/or airway obstruction. "
"Non-Invasive Device for Measuring Stress in Tendons, Ligaments and Muscles"," Measuring muscle and ligament stress is crucial in rehabilitative medicine and medical research. Using this data, clinicians and researchers can develop treatment plans and new technologies to improve outcomes and speed recovery. However, some techniques for gathering this data are highly invasive and involve threading a fiber optic sensor through the tissue or inserting a transducer in the tissue. Current noninvasive procedures are indirect and make assumptions about different tissues to estimate internal stress from external force. "
Fat- and Iron-Corrected T1 Mapping for Diagnosing Liver Disease," Improved MRI methods are needed to diagnose nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common cause of liver disease in the Western world. Promising studies have demonstrated the utility of Tl mapping as a biomarker of liver inflammation. However, there are several confounding factors, including the presence of iron. Iron overload is known to occur in diffuse liver disease and makes it difficult to quantify the effects of inflammation on Tl.  To date, methods to correct for the effects of iron in the liver require the patient to endure lengthy scans. In addition, the presence of fat, which is common in many patients, particularly those with NAFLD and other forms of chronic liver disease, will also confound Tl measurements. "
Image Analysis Method Normalizes Skeleton; Eases Physician Burden," To identify skeletal diseases a patient may be imaged using PET, CT or other methods that detect abnormal image intensity and hence the presence of disease. To identify metastasized cancer lesions, a radioactive tracer such as 18F-NaF may be used. Identifying individual lesions on these types of bone scans is a time-consuming and often subjective process that makes accurate characterization of disease burden challenging. Current automated methods either underestimate disease or struggle with high false positive rates. For physicians analyzing images, the process is complicated by the fact that different bones have different background intensities. Accordingly, as they review scans physicians must mentally discount some image regions while applying greater weight to others. The inability to rely directly on the image increases the potential for error. "
Eliminating CT Image Artifacts Using Artifact ‘Dictionaries’," In modern computed tomography (CT) imaging, a number of non-ideal physical conditions may cause artifacts in the reconstructed images. Mitigation or elimination of image artifacts has been a time- and resource-consuming issue for medical imaging devices.  Certain conventional approaches have been aimed at improving data acquisition hardware so that that acquired data is more consistent with underlying imaging models, or to incorporate a model of a non-ideal acquisition process into a calibration and/or reconstruction process. Such approaches are strongly dependent on the data acquisition methods and the underlying physical and engineering principles. "
Method for Data-Consistency Preparation and Improved Image Reconstruction," Routinely, data acquired with medical imaging systems are not consistent with a single true image of the subject. Data inconsistencies arise from various causes (beam-hardening effects, subject motion, etc.) and manifest as artifacts in the reconstructed images.  Although a qualitative correlation between data inconsistency and the resultant artifacts is known, there are no widely accepted, systematic ways to quantify the relationship between artifacts and data inconsistency levels. Nor is there a method to develop image reconstruction algorithms that incorporate data consistency evaluation and classification into the reconstruction process to sufficiently mitigate artifacts.  Needed is a new method capable of characterizing intrinsic data consistency levels from one datum to another, or from one view of data to another, and to incorporate the new data consistency classification into image reconstruction. This could yield images that are free from or otherwise not corrupted by artifacts, despite inconsistent and/or undersampled data. "
Point-of-Care Obstetrical Imaging for Minimally or Untrained Birth Attendants," Advance warning of some of the main causes of maternal and/or neonatal problems can prevent death and long term health complications. These causes include bleeding (e.g., from placenta previa over the cervix), preterm birth and bleeding or infection from obstructed labor (e.g., from fetal malpresentation or undiagnosed twins). Basic assessment – including gestational age, number and presentation of fetuses and placental location – improves outcomes. For example, women identified at risk of preterm birth can be transported to a skilled center for care and evaluation. "
Post-Processing MRI Fat Suppression Method to Enhance Image Quality and Improve Medical Diagnostics," Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic imaging technique that is especially effective for soft tissues such as the brain and other organs. To produce an MR image, the patient is subjected to a polarizing magnetic field, B0, causing the magnetic moment, or spin, of water molecule protons in tissues to align with the field. An excitation field, B1, then is applied perpendicular to B0 via radio frequency (RF) antenna or coils, which induce a slight excitation in the protons spin. When B1 is terminated, the excited spins return to their equilibrium energy state at a rate characteristic of the specific tissue while emitting very weak nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals. A series of B1 pulses are used to generate NMR signals that are received by the RF coils, digitized and processed to reconstruct a diagnostic image.  Conventional MRI scans require several minutes to acquire data for processing because transverse magnetization is allowed to fully relax between B1 pulses. A newer class of MRI techniques called steady-state free precession (SSFP) employs fast pulse sequences with repetition times much shorter than the relaxation time, which drives the transverse magnetization into a steady-state of equilibrium. Through SSFP methods have much shorter scan times, fat produces bright signals that obscure nearby tissues and banding artifacts appear in regions of B0 inhomogeneity.  UW-Madison researchers previously developed a method to combine NMR signals acquired at the beginning and end of the repetition time in vastly under-sampled isotropic projection reconstruction (VIPR) MRI techniques (see WARF reference number P04252US). This approach utilizes radial acquisition techniques to provide high resolution images at speeds up to 30 times greater than conventional Cartesian sampling and suppress either fat or water in a single acquisition. This method also greatly reduces scan times to increase patient throughput and comfort while minimizing motion artifacts, suppressing fat signals and reducing banding artifacts present in SSFP images. "
Improved CT Imaging with Multisource X-Ray Tube," Computed tomography (CT) provides rapid, noninvasive imaging at high resolution. Conventional CT systems include a gantry, one or two X-ray tubes and a detector assembly that rotate together around a patient at high speed. The system requires heavy and sophisticated control hardware and electronics.  One reason CT systems are so complex is that X-ray tubes have remained essentially unchanged for 80 years. The standard design features a single cathode that emits electrons towards a rotating anode. The reliance on a single electron source means the entire X-ray tube has to be rotated around a patient for a complete scan. This introduces costs and mechanical challenges associated with a rotating gantry. Furthermore, the single source tube has constrained new imaging techniques that could lower radiation doses to patients. "
Rapid MRI Gradient Calibration Using Single-Point Imaging," In MRI, gradient distortions can cause image artifacts such as blurriness, ringing and phase error. Certain MRI techniques are more prone to the problem. In particular, gradient distortion is perhaps the most serious obstacle to clinical adoption of non-Cartesian techniques, where small k-space trajectory errors can lead to significant artifacts. Several solutions have been proposed but suffer various drawbacks (e.g., dependency on slice selection, resolution limitations, complex hardware, etc.). Single-point imaging (SPI) is a potential answer. In this scan technique only one point in k-space is acquired at a fixed time after each excitation pulse. As a result, SPI is immune to the blurring, distortion and shift artifacts associated with other techniques. To date SPI is available on NMR spectrometers but not on clinical MRI systems. "
Improved Phantom for Quantitative Diffusion MRI," Among numerous magnetic resonance imaging contrast mechanisms, the insights that diffusion-weighted MRI provides into microstructural tissue changes make it an excellent biomarker for detection and evaluation of necrosis, infection, fibrosis and cancer. Yet to realize its true diagnostic potential it is vital to develop quantitative diffusion MRI (q-dMRI) techniques that enable accurate, robust and reproducible measurements of diffusivity (or apparent diffusion coefficient, ADC). This would create tremendous opportunities in tumor characterization and treatment monitoring. For q-dMRI to become a valid biomarker, validation of its accuracy and reproducibility is critical. Existing and proposed phantoms do not meet all desired criteria. Still needed are phantoms that exhibit desirable MR spectra, diffusion decay profiles and ADC values spanning the entire range of biological tissues under various physiological conditions and environments. "
Robust Chemical Shift MRI Using Magnetization Transfer," Accurate fat-water separation is critical in diagnosing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Typically the separation is performed using specialized methods such as iterative decomposition with echo asymmetry and least-squares estimation applied to several images acquired with different echo times. While existing chemical species separation techniques, such as IDEAL, represent significant advancement, they can suffer inaccuracies arising from the competing sources of off-resonance (i.e., fat chemical shift and field inhomogeneity). Significant errors (e.g., swapped fat and water) may result. To reduce errors, specialized image processing algorithms have been developed which assume field map smoothness. In practice these methods fail to perform robustly, especially in cases of field inhomogeneities such as near-metal imaging and tissue-air interfaces. Furthermore, these algorithms may be computationally intensive, which limits their implementation on modern scanners.  Still needed is a method for chemical species signal separation that is more reliable and reproducible because it can better control the impact of off-resonance effects on the resulting images and/or quantifications. "
Frame-by-Frame 3-D Reconstruction of Dynamic Catheter Device," Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a less invasive treatment option for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. The procedure involves precise positioning of a balloon-mounted prosthetic valve. Accurate device visualization is highly challenging and critical to success.  Traditional imaging processes are inadequate – conventional X-ray fluoroscopic imaging can only provide a 2-D view of the device, leading to ambiguities in position and orientation. Even cutting-edge multimodal registration systems fail to fully capture device status relative to a patient’s anatomy.  Improved methods are needed enabling a clinician to track devices that change form and position during a procedure. "
Long-Lived Gadolinium-Based Agents for Tumor Imaging and Therapy," Currently, there are no long-lived CT or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging agents that successfully target tumor cells in vivo. While a variety of radiopharmaceuticals are available, these are limited by non-specificity for malignancy, inability to distinguish cancer from inflammation, short biological half-life and generally poor spatial resolution associated with PET and SPECT scanning modalities. There remains a need for a tumor-specific contrast agent to detect, locate and treat solid tumor cancers. Such an agent would represent a tenfold improvement in the spatial resolution currently attainable with positron emission agents and PET scanning. "
Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Metabolites," In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), tissue is scanned using magnetic fields that excite atoms and cause them to emit signals. These nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals can be processed into an image using well-known reconstruction techniques. An isotope called hyperpolarized carbon-13 has spurred interest in a variety of in vivo imaging applications such as vascular imaging and metabolic flux. In particular, C-13 labeled pyruvate and its metabolites (lactate and alanine) are of interest in oncology. The NMR spectrum of these three metabolites is relatively sparse, making them well-suited for chemical shift-based imaging methods like those commonly used to separate water and fat. The standard method for imaging these C-13 isotopes requires large amounts of data: more than 60 NMR signals must be acquired at different echo times to resolve the spectral peaks of alanine and pyruvate. This makes for a difficult choice between scan time and spatial resolution. "
Real-Time MRI Guides Surgical Intervention and Limits Human Error," Many invasive procedures, such as neurosurgeries or breast biopsies, involve inserting a rigid device into the body. To minimize human error, technologies like MRI allow the surgeon to guide the precise placement of such interventional devices according to pre-operative images gleaned from initial scans of the appropriate region. Problems arise in interpreting images taken during the planning phase, however, as position information may change over time. Additional iterations of scanning and device adjustment are often needed for improved accuracy, but this is time-consuming and difficult, as the surgeon must frequently defer to a team of MR technologists and medical physicists for portions of the procedure rather than running the operation. "
Improved Phantom for Iron and Fat Quantification MRI," The ability to quantify fat concentration in the body has become increasingly important given the rise in obesity and related comorbidities. Likewise, the ability to quantify iron concentration is important for monitoring patients receiving treatment for hemochromatosis (an iron overload disorder) as well as routine blood transfusions (i.e., hemosiderosis). Since fat and iron often coexist in organs such as the liver, pancreas and bone marrow, MRI-based quantification techniques have developed rapidly over the past decade to meet this challenge. Validating these techniques using MR phantoms is a critical prerequisite to their widespread clinical translation. However, current phantom designs for fat and iron do not accurately replicate the signal behavior observed in vivo and therefore are not reliable. "
Monomeric Fluorescent Protein-Ligand Complexes with Strong Fluorescence in the Far-Red Region," Fluorescent proteins can be found today in most molecular biology laboratories. Since the discovery of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in the early 1960s, fluorescent molecules have revolutionized many areas of biology. In addition, with the advent of engineered variants possessing increased versatility and sensitivity, their utility as molecular probes (amongst a host of other uses) continues to increase in biological research. Despite recent advances however and as with any technology, existing fluorescent proteins have inherent limitations and there remains a need for further development of new molecules that possess improved functionality and extended utility. "
Controlling Motion Effects in MRI," Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to patient movements due to the long scan times sometimes required. A major source of motion is breathing, which causes artifacts to appear in MR images. Imaging abdominal organs (e.g., liver) is especially challenging for this reason. Patients may have difficulty holding their breath during a scan or may suffer from a disease that affects respiration. Moreover, when contrast agents are injected into tissue (to perform dynamic contrast enhanced imaging or DCE), the process takes even longer and cannot be completed within a single breath hold. "
"High Accuracy Angle Measuring Device for Industrial, Medical, Scientific or Recreational Use"," The ability to measure movement of rotating components with high accuracy is crucial in many applications, including astronomical telescope mounts, field surveillance tools, industrial inspection and calibration, machine tools, medical devices, robotics, and others. The devices used to measure the angles over which rotating components move are called rotary position encoders, and the North American market for these encoders is greater than $500 million. One sub-type, an absolute encoder, is desirable because of its ability to determine present position angle, even if the device has been turned off and on again or moved while powered off. However, a strong limitation to using these encoders is cost. For example, one commercially available system has an advertised accuracy of ±0.4 arc seconds, but it costs approximately $20,000 per system. In addition, encoder systems currently in use for high accuracy angle measurement suffer from large, bulky components, and they often experience measurement errors resulting from mechanical imperfections. "
"Faster, Higher Quality Medical Imaging"," Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) have become invaluable tools for learning about a patient’s health. However, systems are limited by acquisition speed, which often leads to unsatisfactory tradeoffs between spatial resolution and temporal resolution (or radiation dose, in the case of CT). There is significant interest in new acquisition/image reconstruction methods to accelerate the process. While techniques like parallel imaging and compressed sensing have had some success, the need for greater acceleration and image quality remains vital in many applications. "
"Faster, Distortion-Free MRI Near Metallic Implants"," Surgical replacement of joints with mechanical prostheses is on the rise. Unfortunately, complications such as infection and loosening are common and often diagnosed in the late stages, compelling repeat implant surgery. A major challenge for doctors is distinguishing between 10 or more different complications, which requires high-quality soft tissue image contrast.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a great option. However, MRI in the presence of metallic implants is highly challenging because metal distorts the main magnetic field, leading to errors in the images.  Several methods have been developed to overcome this issue, including MAVRIC, SEMAC and a suite of single-point techniques invented at UW–Madison that are excellent at imaging close to metal implants (see WARF reference number P120310US01). However, lengthy scan times are still a problem. "
Ultrasound System Solves Attenuation Problem," Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging is a type of ultrasound elastography with proven diagnostic value. It works by generating a shear wave and detecting differences in attenuation (scattering and absorption) to produce images of soft tissue. The technique is used to assess tumors of the pancreas, prostate, ovaries, deep muscle and kidneys.  Unfortunately, the technique is less successful in imaging other types of tissue, such as the cervix, that have high acoustic attenuation. UW–Madison researchers were driven to address this problem and augment their previously developed method for predicting the risk of preterm birth based on ultrasound measurements of cervical tissue (see WARF reference number P130172US01). "
A Novel Series of Antimicrobials Target Bacteria Membranes to Overcome Antibiotic Resistance," Drug resistant pathogens continue to emerge as the rate of the development of new antimicrobials to combat them continues to decline. Alarmingly, slow-growing bacteria associated with dangerous and prolonged infections are able to survive many classes of clinical antibiotics. For example, β-lactam antibiotics kill rapidly growing cells, but are ineffectual against dormant bacteria. Treating infections with ineffective antibiotics can lead to long-term problems including bacterial drug resistance and relapse.  An effective strategy for combatting slow-growing bacteria is to target their lipid membranes. One-third of all proteins in bacteria are associated with membranes and disrupting this structure inhibits vital cell processes including respiration and energy transduction. The effectiveness of membrane-active drugs is well known. However, most have proven unsuccessful against Gram-negative bacteria, including bacteria of the genera Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas, Helicobacter and Legionella. "
Oligolactic Acid-Paclitaxel and Oligolactic Acid-Docetaxel Prodrugs for Injection,"  PTX, DTX, rapamycin and selumetinib are potent chemotherapeutic agents useful in the treatment of a variety of cancers. Due to their limited water solubility, PTX and DTX are commonly formulated for parenteral infusion with specialized vehicles that include surfactants, such as Cremophor EL (CrEL), and solvents, such as ethanol. CrEL, for example, is known to induce life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions despite pretreatment with antihistamines and steroids.   Due to their limited water solubility, clinically approved rapamycin and selumetinib formulations have low oral absorption, limiting plasma and tumor exposure.   Approved PEG-PLA micelle compositions have been proposed as safe alternative delivery vehicles for poorly water soluble anticancer drugs, e.g., PTX. However, PEG-PLA micelle compositions suffer from low drug loading and poor stability, leading to fast release, widespread biodistribution and low tumor exposure.  "
Compounds and Methods for Modulating Frataxin Expression in Friedreich’s Ataxia," Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disorder without treatments to halt or reverse disease progression, affecting roughly 9,000 Americans. FRDA is caused by triplet expansion in the first intron of FXN (which encodes the protein frataxin). Disease severity correlates with the number of repeats, with affected patients typically having 100s to 1,000s of triplet repeats.FXN mRNA drops 90% in FRDA patients while genetic carriers exhibit expression levels at about 40% and normal function, indicating that lower expression is tolerable. Published work suggests that transcriptional elongation (overcoming ‘paused’ transcription processes) is the major hurdle to making sufficient FXN mRNA. To data, no intervention has sufficiently raised FXN mRNA to combat FRDA symptoms. In the present invention, the researchers focused on resolving the transcriptional pausing hurdle as a means to improve FXN mRNA production. "
Bacterial Membrane Nanoparticles as an Immunotherapy System for Cancer Treatment," Cancer immunotherapy – a therapy that stimulates and employs the body’s own immune system – is one of the most promising new approaches for treating cancer. Despite its tremendous potential, it shows limited effectiveness on patients with immunogenically “cold” tumors, as these tumors remain “hidden” from immune cells. Radiation therapy has been shown to improve the immunotherapy by turning a “cold” tumor into a “hot” one, thereby highlighting tumor cells for immune cell recognition. Significant effort has gone into stimulating immune cells to recognize tumor cells, but available methods are limited and often result in modest therapeutic benefit. "
Gene Correction of Pompe Disease and Other Autosomal Recessive Disorders via CRISPR and other RNA-Guided Nucleases," Pompe disease is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease (mutations from both parent carriers have to be inherited by the offspring to see symptoms) that typically affects children during development, but can also present as an adult. Pompe disease is characterized by a lack of functional acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme. The lack of GAA leads to a glycogen buildup in cells throughout the body, which results in muscular weakness and wasting. Newborns in which the disease is misdiagnosed rarely survive past one year. Currently, children suffering from the disease are provided with GAA enzyme via biweekly intravenous (IV) infusions, but not all children respond to the treatment. Gene therapy is an attractive alternative to enzyme replacement treatment for Pompe disease. However, most conventional gene therapy strategies focus on adding extra copies of the normal gene without correcting the preexisting mutations within the cells of the patient. Correcting the preexisting mutation preserves the natural regulation of the gene and can lead to more durable and efficacious treatments with less toxicity from adding extra copies of the gene. Almost 400 mutations to the gene have been identified, complicating gene therapy approaches. Inventors at UW-Madison explored the possibility of correcting mutations on both mutant alleles using CRISPR-Cas to determine whether there was any advantage to that strategy. "
Bioengineered Vocal Fold Mucosa for Voice Restoration," Voice impairment (dysphonia) affects an estimated 20 million people in the U.S., resulting in reduced quality of life and direct health care costs exceeding $11 billion per year. Between 60 and 80 percent of voice complaints in the treatment-seeking population involve changes to the vocal fold (VF) mucosa. Severe mucosal impairment or loss due to trauma or disease often culminates in fibrosis and deterioration of VF vibratory capacity for voice. Patients with significant VF mucosal damage have limited treatment options. These include implants and injection of regenerative biomaterials, both of which have drawbacks. Creation of a bioengineered VF mucosa could potentially bypass these challenges by providing on-demand tissue for transplantation that is suitable both for voice production and maintenance of barrier function between the tissue and the airway. "
Phospholipid Ether Analogs for Treating and Imaging Pediatric Solid Tumors," Currently there is only one well-studied and established tumor-targeting radioactive agent in pediatric oncology (131I-MIBG), which only targets neuroblastoma and other rare neuroendocrine tumors. It is used in the palliative care setting, and in an ongoing clinical trial of the Children’s Oncology Group, in induction cycles of upfront therapy. In about 10 percent of cases, 131I-MIBG is not taken up by neuroblastoma tumors at all. For other challenging pediatric cancers such as rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma or most brain cancers, effective targeted radiotherapy is currently not available. "
"Inhibiting Quorum Sensing in Staphylococcus Epidermidis, a Health Care Pathogen"," Staphylococcus epidermidis is an important Gram-negative bacterial pathogen in hospital-acquired infections, and the most common cause of infections on indwelling medical devices. The costs related to vascular catheter-related bloodstream infections caused by S. epidermidis are estimated at $2 billion annually in the U.S. alone. Treatment of S. epidermidis infection is complicated by multidrug resistance and persistent biofilm formation.  Bacterial quorum sensing (QS) plays a key role in infection, and targeting this system with pharmacotherapies could significantly attenuate virulence. "
Novel Small Molecule SIRT6 Activators/Inhibitors," The epigenetic modifier SIRT6 is of the sirtuin class of proteins. In transgenic mice, increased SIRT6 expression lowers LDL and triglyceride levels, improves glucose tolerance and increases mitochondrial respiration. Whole-body knockout of SIRT6 leads to profound metabolic defects and an accelerated aging phenotype. Liver-specific disruption of SIRT6 increased glycolysis and triglyceride synthesis, reduced beta oxidation, and increased fatty liver formation.  Reduced SIRT6 expression is observed in human patients diagnosed with fatty liver disease, as well as those with hepatocellular carcinoma and ovarian cancer. Discovery of SIRT6 loss-of-function point mutations in human cancer patients has provided additional evidence that diminished SIRT6 function is causative for cancer. Also, sirtuin activity is linked to the inhibiting of replication of diverse viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus, influenza A (H1N1) virus and an RNA virus.  Lastly, the targeted overexpression of SIRT6 in insulin-producing beta-cells causes increased secretion of insulin in response to glucose. Thus, compounds that promote activity of SIRT6 could be useful for treating liver disease, diabetes and cancer. "
Effective and Robust Method of T Cell Expansion and Activation," T cell based immunotherapy is a rapidly growing field that has experienced impressive clinical anti-cancer successes in the last few years. In particular, it is now possible to generate human T cells that display desired specificities and enhanced functionalities compared with the natural immune system. Ex vivo expansion and activation of T cells are prerequisites for any form of genetically engineered T cell immunotherapy.  Several expansion and activation methodologies have been developed. However, widespread utilization of T cell immunotherapies for treatment of malignancies and potentially many other diseases has been hindered by the lack of rapid, cost-effective and efficient methods for selecting and expanding clinical-grade, therapeutic T cell products that proliferate and persist in vivo.  There remains a need for more robust methodologies for expanding T cell populations having clinical therapeutic potential. "
Synstatin “SSTNI/V” Disrupts Cancer Growth," Leading UW–Madison oncologists previously showed that the matrix receptor syndecan-1 (Sdc1/CD138) – a matrix receptor highly expressed in multiple myeloma – captures and activates multiple cell surface receptors. Among these receptors are the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4, also known as the α4β1 integrin).  IGF-1R provides survival signaling for many tumor cells, including myeloma, as well as for activated endothelial cells. VLA-4 is expressed on leukocytes (lymphoid and myeloid) and their malignant counterparts, including myeloma, and has a major role in cell adhesion, extravasation from the blood stream and invasion. VLA-4 also provides resistance to chemotherapy, a mechanism known as Cell Adhesion-Mediated Drug Resistance or CAM-DR.  Thus, targeting one or both of these important receptors with a single drug holds great promise for disrupting cancer growth. "
Compounds to Treat Hyperlipidemia and Fatty Liver Disease," Hyperlipidemia is a condition strongly associated with obesity and is an independent risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease. To help combat hyperlipidemia, the pharmaceutical industry has focused on a protein, MTP, known to play a role in cardiovascular disease. Certain MTP inhibitors have been developed to lower levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol and triglycerides, and decrease heart disease. Unfortunately, while MTP inhibitors have been shown to be effective, their use can lead to the development of fatty liver disease, or hepatosteatosis. Highly desirable would be a new drug that could prevent this serious side effect. "
Methods and Compositions for Treating Prostate Cancer Using DNA Vaccines," Prostate cancer is a significant health risk for men over the age of 50 and currently is a pervasive health threat with as many as 200,000 new cases diagnosed each year in the US alone. At present, there is no accepted adjuvant treatment for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy or ablative radiation therapy that has been proven to prevent progression to metastatic disease. "
TTNPB Analogs Useful for Preventing or Treating Cancer," Retinoic acid and a number of its analogs have shown some ability to prevent and treat cancer. One of the most potent is 4-[(E)-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-napthalenyl)-1-propenyl]benzoic acid, or TTNPB. However, toxicity has been a significant obstacle to the development of these compounds. "
Enzyme Aids Intranasal Drug Delivery," Currently, delivering drugs directly into the brain requires invasive surgery. This is because a tight cellular layer called the blood-brain barrier (BBB) not only prevents harmful substances from entering the brain, but also blocks many therapeutic agents.  Major research is now focused on bypassing the BBB and delivering drugs intranasally. While many factors influence how drugs are absorbed via the nose, it is known that certain substances can make the nasal lining, or epithelium, more permeable. Such ‘absorption/permeability enhancers’ include bile salts and other chemicals. However, none of these are used in conjunction with nasal peptide or protein drugs (e.g., calcitonin, desmopressin and oxytocin) because they can be toxic and cause irreversible damage to epithelial cells. "
Synthesizing Natural Products to Treat High Blood Cholesterol," Indole is one of the most abundant heterocycles in pharmaceuticals and bioactive natural products, such as indometacin, a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, and vincristine, a natural product used to treat a number of types of cancers. Given the importance of indoles, much effort has been devoted to preparing them from a variety of starting materials. However, inefficiency, low selectivity and low yield remain a problem for polysubstituted indoles or when the indole is in a complex polycyclic system. "

New Hormone Analogs for Treating Hypoparathyroidism," G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the targets of many current therapeutic agents. As they can adopt multiple activated states, there is increasing interest in synthetic molecules that display altered receptor-state selectivity patterns relative to natural agonists. Receptor state-selective agonists are highly prized because these molecules can serve as powerful tools for elucidating signal-transduction mechanisms, and they may give rise to therapeutic agents with minimal deleterious side effects. At present, there is no way to design such agonists via rational methods.  The parathyroid hormone receptor-1 (PTHR1) is a GPCR that plays a key role in regulating several important physiological functions. Its agonists, including PTH(1-34) (the active ingredient in the drug teriparatide), are used to treat osteoporosis and potentially hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism is the underproduction of parathyroid hormone, leading to low levels of calcium in the blood and serious symptoms. Chronic hypoparathyroidism is conventionally treated with vitamin D analogs and calcium supplementation. However, such treatments are contraindicated in many patients due to potential renal damage. "
Use of Salate Derivatives to Treat Multiple Sclerosis, Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease affecting 2.5 million people worldwide. The disease is difficult to manage and there is no cure. The underlying mechanism of MS progression is thought to be either destruction by the immune system or failure of myelin-producing cells. The cause of the disease is not known.  Current treatments attempt to improve symptoms after an attack and prevent new attacks. Medications are only modestly effective and may have side effects and be poorly tolerated. Life expectancy is five to 10 years lower than that of the unaffected population. 
Wis.L Master Cell Bank for Vaccine Development," FDA-qualified cell lines must be used for virus production for human vaccines. There are relatively few of these lines available and several (WI-38, MRC-5) used for virus production are becoming senescent. Due to current and potential restrictions, fetal tissue-derived lines are not being replaced as they senesce. "
Improved Influenza B Virus Replication for Vaccine Development," The epidemiology of influenza Type B viruses differs from Type A; influenza B viruses primarily circulate in humans and do not cause pandemics. However, in some seasons the impact of influenza B infections on morbidity and mortality can exceed influenza A. Over the past few decades, viruses of two influenza B lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) have circulated in humans, and both lineages are now represented in vaccines as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). While influenza B virus vaccines for humans have been available for more than 50 years, no systematic efforts have been undertaken to develop high-yield candidates. "
"SIgA Protein as Heath Supplement for Animals, Humans"," Secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) plays a critical role in immunity. The protein is found in breast milk and secreted in the gastrointestinal system during development and adulthood. Research suggests that animals and humans deprived of sIgA due to early weaning or health defect are at higher risk for disorders like celiac disease, skin allergy and inflammatory bowel disease. At present there is no method for harvesting large quantities of sIgA. To be useful as a commercial health supplement, the protein must be directly obtained from an animal source at high purity and low cost. "

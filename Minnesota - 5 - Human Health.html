    Arrhythmic cardiomyopathy can cause severe problems including cardiac arrest and death. Unfortunately, many of the therapeutics to treat arrhythmias can actually have pro-arrhythmic side effects. This technology is an antagomir
    targeting miR-448 (anti-miR-448), a microRNA linked to the downregulation of the sodium channel SCN5A. Relieving the inhibition of miR-448 facilitates the upregulation of SCN5A, which is protective against arrhythmia, while bypassing
    the potential pro-arhythmic side-effects of existing therapies.

    Despite decades of research, there are currently no effective therapies for tauopathies, a class of neurodegenerative disorders that include Alzheimer’s disease. While recent studies have indicated that tau oligomers are the primary
    toxic species in these diseases, very few clinical compounds that target tau itself are being pursued. To fill this gap, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed biosensors that monitor tau oligomer and monomer
    conformations that can be used as a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform to identify novel compounds that modulate tau and attenuate associated toxicity. These compounds could be used in research to accelerate our understanding of
    tauopathies and how to treat them and/or could be developed as therapeutics.
</p>
,
<p>
    The technology works through two engineered distinct fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors. The first of these biosensors measures intermolecular interactions between separate tau proteins, allowing a readout of
    oligomerization. The second biosensor uses single-molecule FRET (smFRET), to assess conformational changes within single tau proteins. Combined, the readout from these molecular probes will facilitate identification of compounds that
    inhibit tau oligomerization, and provide immediate insights into mechanism of action. Another major advantage of these biosensors is that they are functional in live cells, allowing screening to be carried out in a biologically relevant
    context and without the need for costly and time consuming purification protocols.

    Cancerous cells exhibit alterations to their metabolism that may contribute to proliferation, survival and the development of drug resistance to commonly prescribed cancer treatments. Unfortunately the mechanisms of these metabolic
    changes aren’t well understood, limiting progress on cancer drug therapies. Laurie Parker’s lab at the University of Minnesota developed four artificial, cell-permeable kinase substrates that serve as biosensors for serine/threonine
    kinases (LKB1, AMPK, mTOR and Akt) that are intimately involved in metabolism regulation. The ability to determine the activity of these critical kinases in normal, cancerous and drug-resistant cancer cells will help determine the
    metabolic activities of cells, how resistance develops, and provide molecular targets for therapeutic development.
</p>

<p>
    The kinase-specific biosensors have the potential to be combined with assayable fluorophores or other signal moieties, or the phosphorylation of the peptidesalone can be measured using alternate methods such as mass spectrometry.
    Substrates can further be selected based on their ability to permeate the membrane and their compatibility with live cells, The capability of the sensors to provide real-time signaling facilitates the potential to simultaneously monitor
    distinct kinase activities in native cellular environments. The sensors are antibody independent, can be optimized for high-throughput screening methods and (unlike other approaches to monitoring kinase activity) do not need to be
    genetically encoded, making them ideal for development in diagnostic applications.

    Kinase signaling is a major mechanism driving many cancers, particularly leukemias. However, due to variation between cancers, chemotherapeutic kinase inhibitors (such as imatinib/Gleevec) exhibit different levels of efficacy on a
    patient-by-patient basis. With no feasible way to determine which treatment is best suited to each patient, nearly $100 million dollars and precious treatment time are lost every year to ineffective therapies. To determine the best
    kinase inhibitor treatment strategy on an individual basis, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a multiplexed mass spectrometry assay that is capable of analyzing and comparing the specific activity of multiple
    kinases exposed to different therapeutics. Furthermore, the analysis for all these conditions can be run in tandem, saving time and money.
</p>
,
<p>
    The power of the assay to simultaneously measure a variety of kinases exposed to multiple compounds is enabled by isotope-coding of kinase-specific substrates. Cancer cells, various inhibitors and kinase specific peptide substrates are
    coincubated. The substrates are isotopically distinct for each condition, allowing kinase inhibitor activity to be measured and directly compared after carrying out mass spectrometry on pooled samples.This provides a robust, fast and
    affordable method to determine if a patient will respond to a variety of different kinase inhibitor therapeutics. Furthermore, since clinics already routinely use mass spectrometry for metabolite analysis, this approach can immediately
    be implemented using existing workflows and machinery. This technology has the capability to transform kinase inhibitor treatments and serve as a model system for introducing pharmacodynamics into personalized medicine for leukemias and
    other cancers.

    Currently, there is no clinically approved drug to specifically treat the SARS-CoV-2 viral infections, and owing to the catastrophic nature of the pandemic there is a race to find a viable treatment. Unfortunately, many traditional drug
    types have limitations that slow the speed at which they can be identified and developed. Small molecule drugs often suffer from relatively low specificity (resulting in side effects). Conversely, traditional antibody drugs often have
    poor pharmacokinetics, are unstable and are expensive to produce. As an alternative route to avoid these limitations, Dr. Fang Li’s lab and Dr. Aaron LeBeau’s lab at the University of Minnesota have developed a series of camelid
    nanobodies (“Nanosota-1”) that are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
</p>
,
<p>
    Nanobodies are single domain antibodies produced by camels and llamas that are much smaller than traditional antibodies, but still bind with high affinity and specificity. Representative nanobodies in the Nanosota series have been
    experimentally shown to bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with high affinity, block binding of the protein to the human ACE2 receptor, and inhibit entry into mammalian cells. Owing to their optimal therapeutic and physical properties, these
    camelid nanobodies have high potential for development into a novel COVID-19 treatment. Development is ongoing and animal trials are underway. Preliminary results have shown that one representative nanobody protected hamsters from
    SARS-CoV-2 infections both prophylactically and therapeutically.

    Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and with solid tumors occurring most commonly (e.g. lung, breast, prostate and colorectal cancers). Due to high variability of the cancers and patients, treatments are often complex and not
    uniformly effective. As an alternative to treatment, researchers at the University of Minnesota developed an approach to prevent cancer through inhibiting the transcription factor STAT3, which is activated in a high percentage of solid
    tumors. STAT3 blockers could be introduced to individuals predisposed to cancer (due to family history, previous occurence of cancer, genetic conditions, etc), or those that are exposed to carcinogenic factors (asbestos, tobacco smoke,
    chemotherapeutics, radiation, etc).
</p>
,
<p>
    Although STAT3 has been implicated in cancer incidence for some time, attempts to use STAT3 blockers to treat existing cancer have unfortunately been unsuccessful. The lab of Dr.Jill Siegfried found that preventative administration of a
    STAT3 blocker following tobacco carcinogen exposure, reduced the occurrence of lung carcinomas by over 80% in a mouse model of disease. While many STAT3 blockers tested have shown low biological activity in patients and high toxicity,
    Siegfried narrowed in on an oligonucleotide based molecule that shows no detectable toxicity after repeat dosing in mice (even when immunocompromised), is highly active, and prevents lung cancer formation at relatively low doses.
    Expanding on these findings has the potential to yield a chemopreventive agent for patients at elevated risk for development of STAT3 associated cancers.

    A new process creates uniquely functional/active textiles using multi-material 3D printing combined with traditional textile equipment (e.g., circular knitting machine). The process involves 3D printing novel, yarn-like filaments with

    This functional compression garment clothing activates upon touching the body and self-fits to the body without a power source. The SMA activated compression garment is passive and loose fitting when cool (i.e., ambient room
    temperatures or even freezing temperatures) and activates to apply pressure on the body as it warms to skin temperature. This approach enables new, dynamic, wearable compression garments with controllable activation and low effort
    donning and doffing.
</p>
,
<p>
    This SMA compression garment provides <b>dynamic compression</b> for therapeutic relief. The garment features nickel titanium (NiTi) alloy SMA spring actuators that contract with heat to provide compressive force when electrical power
    is applied. A novel tension-limiting switch gives patients independent control of compression by applying electrical power to SMA actuators to provide compressive force. The tension switch can also prevent patients from applying an
    incorrect amount of power and/or overheating the SMA springs. The unique feedback mechanism of the tension switch consumes no electrical power; it instead uses the mechanical properties of its material.

    This technology uses SMA knitted actuators in a novel way to create self-fitting, on-body clothing and wearables. The technology leverages large and controllable displacements, and variable stiffness qualities to make textiles that are
    compliant and flexible in their inactive state, and become stiffer in their active state. SMA textiles are temperature sensitive and could actuate using the body’s thermal energy or other forms of heating. This textile could be used in
    conjunction with high-force SMA textiles in a single garment to provide the necessary fitting for appropriate force output. This material could be used in place of commonly used fasteners/fitting mechanisms, such as lacing, hook and
    loop tape, ratcheting systems, hooks and eyes, zippers, and snaps.\n

    Topoisomerase II (topo II or Top2) poisons, are a major class of drugs widely used to treat cancers including testicular cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma and ovarian cancer. These drugs work by generating DNA
    damage. However, drug resistance can limit the efficacy of treatment. Human tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase II (TDP2) counteracts the effect of Top2 poisons thus repairing the damaged DNA and leading to chemotherapeutic resistance. To
    mitigate this form of cancer drug-resistance, Dr .Zhengqiang Wang (University of Minnesota) and Dr. Yves Pommier (National Cancer Institute) developed novel phenoxyphenyldeazaflavin compounds that effectively inhibit TDP2 in cancer cell
    lines. Through the inhibition of DNA damage repair machinery, these compounds functionally sensitize cancer cells toward widely-used anticancer Top2 poisons.
</p>
,
<p>
    While previous deazaflavin compounds inhibit TDP2 in biochemical assays, they have not shown strong efficacy in cancer cells. This new technology, which modifies the critical structure of the deazaflavin core, generates the first-ever
    compounds that demonstrate strong efficacy in cancer cell lines. Using these new compounds in conjunction with Top2 poisons cancer therapies inhibits TDP2, keeping Top2 poisons effective and preventing resistance.
</p>
,
<p>
    At concentrations as low as 3 nM, one of the deazaflavin analogs substantially increased the intracellular concentration of Top2 poisons, likely by inhibiting transporter-mediated efflux. This modality will allow the technology to be
    used much more broadly in combination with cancer drugs which suffer from poor efficacy due to efflux.

    \nElderly trauma patients are at high risk of mortality even when presenting with minor injuries. Providing proper medical care is especially challenging as these patients are medically complex and generate many ethical, financial, and

    \nLipid composition of cell membranes plays an important role in determining the permeability, interaction with biomolecules, and stability of the membrane. Lipid composition is therefore tightly regulated by a number of factors,
    including lipid transfer proteins and interaction with lipid particles. Quantitative understanding of lipid transfer from one biomembrane to another has significant implications in discerning complex biophysical behavior of proteins and
    other biomolecules. Changes in the expression of certain lipid transfer proteins can also trigger biomedical-related events such as inflammation and programmed cell death processes (e.g. autophagy and necroptosis). Researchers at the
    University of Minnesota have created a new assay to quantify lipid transfer activity using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based approach with bicelles. This technology can be used to: \ndetermine if a protein of
    interest facilitates lipid transfer between membranes,\naccurately determine the rate of lipid transfer, and\nidentify and evaluate drug candidates that can modulate lipid transfer activity.\n\n\n<br />
    <br />
    \nThis bicelle-based assay offers several advantages over liposome-based approach by providing higher stability and enabling high-throughput screening. Bicelles exhibit enhanced ‘shelf-life’ such as stability during refrigeration and
    avoidance of freeze-thaw changes that plague lipid vesicles. In addition, the small size of bicelles results in minimal light scattering artifacts increasing the reliability and reproducibility of FRET measurements. Lastly, this assay
    can be used to study lipid transfer between donor bicelles and a variety of acceptor model membranes (such as bicelles, liposomes, and micelles). \n

,
<p>\nThe stability of this technology enables it to be the basis for a commercial benchtop kit that will allow researchers to investigate lipid transfer activity without needing to acquire expertise in lipid techniques.</p>

    Cancer cells are resilient because they rewire their metabolism to promote cell proliferation, survival, tumour growth and long‐term maintenance. Solid tumors exhibit metabolic plasticity that allows them to produce energy from either
    glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation, or both. This necessitates that effective therapies must target and inhibit both pathways. There is abundant interest in developing small molecules that selectively target these two aberrant
    metabolic pathways. The search for dual-activity molecules has been impaired by the toxicity of many agents targeting mitochondrial function resulting in a therapeutic window that is too restrictive. To overcome these challenges,
    researchers at the University of Minnesota designed a molecule, F-MD-1 and its derivatives, that exhibits potency in inhibiting glycolysis and mitochondrial function with a large therapeutic window.
</p>
,
<p>
    F-MD-1 works through inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1/4) and the mitochondrial pyruvate carriers (MPC1/2) involved in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. This dual inhibition mechanism is necessary for the
    elimination of cancer as opposed to only tumor reduction. The chemical structure includes a lipophilic cyanocinnamate template designed to create a potent, but reversible, inhibition mechanism. This reversibility makes the molecule
    generally well tolerated when administered systemically, a drastic improvement on the current toxic compounds that target mitochondrial function. Using various cancer cell lines, F-MD-1 effectively inhibits mitochondrial function and
    ATP production as well as the glycolytic capacity of cells. The compound also exhibits improved kinetics and stability compared to its predecessors. These properties lend F-MN-D1 to development as a new anticancer agent that targets
    tumor metabolic plasticity that is common in many solid tumors.\n\n\n

    More than one-third of adults in the US are obese and anually $190 billion is spent on the treatment of obesity and obesity-related complications. Health care providers are in need of new approaches to combat this growing health crisis.
    While there are many pathways in the body that control appetite and weight, the final step is controlled by two receptors in the brain, melanocortin receptors 3 and 4 (MC3R and MC4R). Previous work research failed to identify agonists
    for MC3R, so much effort has been put into anti-obesity compounds targeting MC4R. Unfortunately, these molecules have resulted in increased blood pressure in humans. Dr. Haskell-Luevano at the University of Minnesota has developed the
    first compounds that activate MC3R, while inhibiting MC4R. This unique activity profile is anticipated to increase weight-loss in patients without causing hypertension.
</p>
,
<p>
    Using an uncommon (but powerful) screening approach, Dr. Haskell-Luevano identified compounds in a brand new chemical space for melanocortin agonists. As the first compounds ever reported to selectively activate MC3R, these cyclized,
    penta-peptides represent promising anti-obesity therapeutics. Furthermore, their antagonistic activity against MC4R, minimizes the risk of high blood pressure observed with previous melanocortin receptor-targeting drugs. Additionally,
    there is evidence for MC3R dependent anti-inflammatory activity in vascular and lung tissue, so these compounds have potential as anti-inflammatory therapeutics. .

    Many current (and future) anticancer drugs have difficulty entering cancer cells either due to physical properties or the action of membrane efflux pumps that actively remove drugs from the cells. Synthetic polymers are used extensively
    to improve the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, many such polymers require complex chemistry to conjugate or encapsulate drugs, and can be inefficient at releasing the drugs after entering cells. Chun Wang’s lab at the
    University of Minnesota engineered an elegant solution to these limitations combining synthetic mebranolytic polymer and chemotherapeutic drugs without the need to physically link the two components, facilitating easy formulation and
    delivery of effective cancer treatments.
</p>
,
<p>
    Dr. Wang’s lab has developed a synthetic membranolytic polymer, poly(6-amino-1-hexyl methacrylate) (PAHM), that enhances the permeability of cancer cells to anticancer drugs. In vitro tests and mouse models of solid tumors have shown
    that use of PAHM in combination with typical chemotherapeutic drugs (like doxorubicin) results in synergistic killing of cancer cells. This synergy facilitates massive reduction in the amount of chemotherapeutic drug required, which
    would likely minimize associated side effects when translated to humans. The polymer’s ability to work with a variety of existing compounds indicates that this approach is applicable to enhance treatments to a wide variety of solid
    tumors, including those that are drug resistant.

    Cell transplantation is a promising therapeutic technique for the treatment of end-stage liver disease, acute liver failure and some liver-based metabolic disorders. However, there remains a need for an on-demand supply of large numbers
    of high quality primary human hepatocytes. Current cryopreservation techniques damage cells and fall far short of being able to produce the required quantities of functioning hepatocytes for treatment. Work in John Bischof’s lab at the
    University of Minnesota has developed a method to infuse organs with a cryopreservation solution containing magnetic nanoparticles prior to freezing that allows them to be rewarmed usingalternating magnetic fields. The solution and
    nanoparticles are subsequently washed out and this technique avoids the damage typically caused during the thawing processes and facilitates the recovery of large quantities of functional cells.\n
</p>
,
<p>
    Execution of the developed method may be used to recover and produce large numbers (1010 or greater) of functional cells. Of particular importance is that in animal models this technique has been shown capable of isolating high-quality
    cells even from livers donated after cardiac death (DCD), which are typically considered suboptimal and of little use for donation. Furthermore, since cell isolation happens <i>after</i> thawing the organ, the organ can be transported
    over long distances and extended periods of time, this facilitates identification of an ideal patient match and mitigates rejection risks. This approach can also be optimized for organs other than the liver, including kidney, heart,
    pancreas and lungs (among other). This method has the capacity to make use of thousands of donated organs that would typically be discarded, saving countless lives through facilitating cell transplants and the creation of bioartificial
    organs.

    Traditional opiate-based pain therapeutics are linked to opioid use disorders, thus necessitating the development of novel, non-additive alternatives. One potential target for such new compounds is the human Histidine Triad Nucleotide
    Binding Protein 1 (hHint1). hHint1 is involved in the regulation of a broad range of CNS functions including opioid signaling, tolerance, neuropathic pain, and nicotine dependence. These roles, along with its widespread expression in
    the brain, have led hHint1 to be of high interest for research and therapeutic targeting. Given hHINT1’s role in modulating tolerance to opioids, it is a viable non-opioid receptor target for the next generation of pain medications.
    Researchers at the University of Minnesota rationally designed and synthesized hHint inhibitors that bind the protein with submicromolar affinities. These unique small-molecules could be used to further determine the role of Hint1 in
    the CNS or developed into therapeutics for indications for which there are limited options.
</p>
,
<p>
    Previous work using the hHint inhibitor Tryptamine Guanosine carbamate (TrpGc) has shown that hHint1 inhibition is a successful strategy to enhance the pain relieving effects of morphine while preventing tolerance. However, TrpGc
    exhibits low solubility which limits the applications it can be used in. The newly developed inhibitors are nucleoside analogs containing acyl-sulfamate or acyl-sulfimide that show increased solubility as well as binding to hHint1, up
    to 16 times higher affinity than TrpGc. These favorable properties facilitate the use of these compounds in a variety of applications and formulations as well as in the treatment of indications ranging from neuropathic pain and drug
    dependence.

<p>
    Tosedostat, an anti-cancer drug also known as CHR-2797, shows promise as a potential analgesic. The compound has significant analgesic activity and is synergistic with morphine in mouse models. Tosedostat is an aminopeptidase inhibitor
    that blocks the inactivation of endogenous opioid peptides (enkephalins) by aminopeptidases (enkephalinases). This inhibition allows enkephalins to remain in the body longer than they normally would, providing extended analgesic effect
    by binding to μ and δ opioid receptors in the periphery. This method of use is unlikely to overstimulate pain related receptors, thus reducing risk of tolerance, dependency or addiction. Tosedostat as an analgesic could work in
    combination with—or even replace—current analgesic compounds.
</p>
,
<p>
    Prescription painkillers like morphine and other opioids have high abuse potential and often lead to dependency, addiction and increased tolerance. In addition, they can induce severe adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting,
    constipation, respiratory depression and sedation. Alternatives to opioids, like steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), face other drawbacks. These drugs can induce serious side effects such as ulcers, bleeding
    and kidney and liver toxicity. Using Tosedostat as an analgesic allows the body’s natural opioid peptides (enkephalins) to exert an analgesic effect. Because the analgesic effect is restricted to the periphery (i.e., the compound works
    outside the brain), risk of dependence, addiction, increased tolerance or respiratory depression could be reduced or even eliminated. Repurposing Tosedostat for analgesia may provide a pain relief alternative with reduced adverse
    effects. And because Tosedostat has undergone human clinical trials for anticancer activity, its toxicity and side effects are already being evaluated and studied extensively.

    Genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 has promised to deliver incredible capabilities for precise genome editing. While this approach is incredibly robust at targeting highly-specific sites in the genome to induce double-stranded breaks
    (DSB), these sites are most-frequently repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) that results in small, unspecific insertions or deletions of DNA. The highly desirable ability to introduce new, predetermined genetic information at
    these locations using homology-directed repair (HDR) has proven inefficient. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed an approach to enhance HDR efficiency by covalently linking the desired donor DNA to the Cas9-guide
    RNA complex through a fused HUH endonuclease. This effectively co-localizes (in both space and time) the donor DNA at the site of the DSB for incorporation, resulting in a 30-fold increase in HDR efficiency.
</p>
,
<p>
    HUH-endonucleases cut and bind to specific DNA sequences, resulting in a covalent link to the DNA (via tyrosine) in a rapid and stable manner. Furthermore, it has been shown that in a HUH-Cas9 fusion protein, both proteins retain
    activity. This fusion complex can be introduced to a guide-RNA directed to a desired genome location for editing, as well as ssDNA that includes the HUH target site and the preferred donor DNA sequences. The result of this combination
    is a Cas9 protein targeted to a specific location, tethered (by HUH) to the donor DNA for use in HDR. Even at low concentrations, this complex results in improved HDR efficiency in multiple cell types and at multiple target loci. The
    availability of multiple HUH proteins with different DNA recognition sequences also opens up the possibility of simultaneously incorporating multiple targeted editing events with different donor sequences in a single cell. Other
    strategies have attempted to co-deliver donor DNA with Cas9 machinery using either a biotin-avidin bridge or a SNAP tag. However, these approaches are more complicated experimentally, require incorporation of expensive and non-natural
    DNA bases or modifications, and cannot incorporate many editing complexes at once. HUH-Cas9 fusion proteins could facilitate progress in a variety of applications including plant editing in agriculture, human therapeutics (editing of
    stem cells and eggs) and a myriad of basic research scenarios.

    Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins have been repeatedly implicated in inflammation, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, making them enticing targets for the development of potential therapeutics. However, it has been
    challenging to develop inhibitors selective enough to pass clinical trials due to dose limiting toxic side effects. Researchers at the University of Minnesota carried out detailed structure-activity relationship studies resulting in the
    development of compounds that specifically inhibit BRD4-BD1, and avoid off-target interactions with other proteins (including bromodomain-containing proteins).
</p>
,
<p>
    BET proteins function as “readers” of epigenetic modifications on the genome modulating transcription and regulating cellular processes including cell proliferation and cell differentiation. For example the BET protein BRD4 interacts
    with super-enhancer regions, regulating c-Myc expression, a protein that is implicated in as many as 50% of all cancers. A previously identified BET inhibitor also inhibited other bromodomain containing proteins and p38ɑ kinase. Based
    off of crystal structures of inhibitors bound to the kinase or BRD4, researchers modified the compound to enhance BET activity while reducing kinase activity &gt;90,000 fold. Further modifications increased cell permeability of the
    molecule. Therapeutic potential of the compound was demonstrated through verifying activity against cancer cells (MM.1S cells), which was further supported by reduced c-Myc expression.

    \nAffinity-based cell separation is a technique in which affinity between a cell-surface biomarker and a complimentary, substrate-bound capture ligand is used to capture specific cells. Affinity-based cell separation offers key
    advantages such as simplicity, high specificity and label-free isolation. The captured target cells are released via a variety of methods including shear force, substrate deformation, chemical or enzymatic treatment. However, these
    approaches have several disadvantages, such as\n

<p>
    \nResearchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a method to release affinity-captured cells using a molecular release mechanism that does not damage or alter the cells. This technology uses a molecular recognition and
    release trigger approach that is independent of the capture mechanism, thereby making this method versatile and readily adaptable for any cell type. After capturing the cells, large, specific, non-toxic “molecular trigger” compounds are
    immobilized adjacent to the ligand-cell complexes; as the captured trigger compounds adopt an extended conformation, the ligand-biomarker bond is broken, releasing the captured cells. Combined with affinity-based cell capturing, this
    release technology offers a comprehensive, widely-adaptable platform for effective cell sorting. \n

    Spinal cord injuries can result in serious, debilitating outcomes including quadriplegia or paraplegia. There is a dire need to identify treatment strategies for this type of nervous tissue damage. Regenerative therapy has focused on
    the use of stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries and all related clinical trials have reported favorable safety profiles. Unfortunately, these same trials have failed to show improvement in patient nerve function. Drs. Leslie Morse
    and Ricardo Battaglino identified dental pulp stem cells as a promising therapeutic and have developed a method to prepare these cells and subsequently used them in rat models of spinal cord injury. These dental stem cells could be
    developed into treatments for patients with nervous tissue injuries.

    Opioids like morphine have been used extensively for the treatment of chronic pain, including pain that is the result of diseases like cancer, AIDS and sickle cell disease. The analgesic effect from activation of the mu opioid receptor
    (MOR) is unfortunately accompanied by undesirable side-effects including tolerance and dependence. Furthermore, the administration of morphine and other opioids has been shown to actually enhance HIV infection in patients. To overcome
    these limitations, researchers at the University of Minnesota developed a two-part molecule, MCC22, that activates MOR to deliver analgesic effects while antagonizing CCR5 to suppress opioid-induced side effects.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
    Although mu opioids reduce pain, chronic use promotes increased pain sensitivity through the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines, including CCL5. This chemokine binds CCR5 (which colocalizes with MOR in glia and neurons) and the
    CCL5/CCR5 complex plays a major role in neuroinflammation. CCR5 is also the main co-receptors utilized by HIV-1 viruses to enter cells and accelerate AIDS progression. Through activating MOR and blocking CCR5, MCC22 is a potent
    analgesic that mitigates the pain sensitivity and neuroinflammation commonly associated with opioids. Furthermore, MC22 inhibits immune cell migration into the central nervous system, which is a critical step in HIV-mediated
    neuropathogenesis that leads to NeuroAIDS. MCC22 shows promise as a treatment of both inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions where conventional analgesics have reduced efficacy.

    \nProf. Lim at the University of Minnesota has developed a new method to suppress and potentially cure tinnitus using synchronized multi-modal stimulation of the brain. The technology consists of algorithms and devices that
    non-invasively or transcutaneously stimulate auditory and non-auditory pathways in a highly synchronized fashion. The technique stems from the hypothesis that tinnitus patients who experience abnormal brain representations continue to
    retain the normal (original) brain representations; and, by “shocking” specific regions of the brain, the brain can be switched back to the normal representation. Using highly synchronized multi-modal stimulation of specific regions in
    the brain, this technology acts as a “neural switch” that can switch neural activity to suppress tinnitus and phantom limb pain.
</p>
,
<p>
    Tinnitus, the perception of sound with no external source, affects 15-20% of the population and currently has no cure. Existing therapies include medications, using masking noises, or simply retraining the brain using individually
    programmed tonal music. While these methods eases tinnitus to a certain degree, they do not address the underlying cause. The technology disclosed here, on the other hand, induces a strong synchronous shock to specific regions of the
    brain to reset it from an abnormal state back to the normal state. Owing to such novel method of action, this non-invasive treatment technology has the potential to successfully switch the firing pattern of tinnitus-affected neurons to
    suppress and cure tinnitus and phantom limb pain. \n

    The vast majority of therapies found to be effective in mouse models of neurodegeneration fail in humans. This failure to translate highlights the need to ensure that transgenic animal models are created with intense attention to detail
    to increase relevance and understanding of the associated limitations. Mutation P301L in the protein tau (encoded by the MAPT gene) is a common mutation linked to neurodegeneration and represents an important area of focus. The mouse
    model currently used to study this mutation (rTg4510), has a 70-copy tau-transgene insertion in a 244 kb deletion of another gene (Fgf14). These additional genomic changes confound the observed-phenotypes which may or may not be due to
    the P301L mutation of interest. The lab of Dr. Michael Koob at the University of Minnesota has carefully developed a cleaner mouse model for the purpose of studying the role of the Tau P301L mutant in neurodegeneration. This transgenic
    mouse includes a single targeted MAPT cDNA insertion that expresses tauP301L (T2 mouse).

    Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, as such research efforts abound to develop improved therapeutic treatment options. Chemotherapeutic drugs often work through causing DNA damage in cancer cells to elicit anti-tumor responses
    and cell death. Unfortunately, this DNA damage also occurs in healthy cells, leading to serious side effects and increasing the risk of future cancer. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a small molecule (4Ei-10),
    that achieves its anti-cancer effects in two ways: 1) blocking cell proliferation through inhibiting translation of new proteins, and 2) inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through induction of the potent anti-cancer protein, p53.
    Unlike current chemotherapeutic drugs that upregulate p53, 4Ei-10 does so without causing DNA damage, likely circumventing both burdensome side-effects and the risk of developing new cancer. The dual mode of action of 4Ei-10 has the
    potential to act as a “double-edged sword” against particularly aggressive cancers, and could replace or reduce the dosages of traditional, problematic chemotherapeutic drugs.

    The use of human cells as therapeutics is an area of rapid expansion and has made it possible to treat diseases that have no other options available. Development of cellular therapeutics is drastically hindered by labor intensive
    processes required to obtain even small amounts of pure cell populations. Natural Killer (NK) cells have been widely identified as a promising therapeutic for a variety of cancers and viral infections (including HIV), but are resistant
    to gene manipulation and can only be obtained from a blood draw. A related cell population, group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) have been shown to be important for the integrity of mucosal tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract
    and are thought to be important in the formation and homeostasis of secondary lymphoid tissue and could facilitate immune recovery after chemotherapy or bone-marrow transplants. Unfortunately, the only method currently available to
    obtain these cells is to harvest them from surgically removed lymph nodes, tonsils or from aborted fetal tissue. Despite the potential clinical application, this serious limitation has effectively barred any genuine progress in fully
    understanding these cells and/or developing them as a therapeutic.
</p>
,
<p>
    To bypass these limitations, Drs. Michael Verneris, Jeffrey Miller and Bruce Blazar at the University of Minnesota developed methods to create large quantities of NK cells or ILC3 cells from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In the case
    of NK cells, this technology could facilitate genetic manipulation of NK cells (which are inherently resistant to gene editing) by introducing alterations to HSCs prior to differentiation. This includes the addition of a chimeric
    antigen receptor (CAR) that would allow re-directing NK cells to tumor antigens. This technology also represents the first method to produce ILC3 cells in high numbers. This approach would not use lymph node biopsies, tonsillectomies or
    human fetal tissue. This work will facilitate foundational clinical trials of ILC3 adoptive transfer which could serve as novel studies in areas of chemotherapy induced mucosal injury .

    The hunt for cancer therapies continues to be a major field of study in academia and industry. Unfortunately, many anti-cancer drugs with promising in vitro efficacy are found to be ineffective in vivo. This is due in large part to the
    limitations of current in vitro models. Conventional 2D monolayer cell cultures cannot accurately mimic characteristics of native tumor microenvironments, and current 3D cultured tumor cells, while able to more closely mimic natural
    behaviors, still cannot model the tumor microenvironment. To better utilize resources (including time, research animals and funds) and increase clinical translation, models that more accurately mimic both tumor environment and behavior
    are needed. To that end, researchers at the University of Minnesota developed a method to bioprint 3D tumor models with increased functionality and relevance, bridging the gap between 2D cell cultures and animal models.
</p>
,
<p>
    The design incorporates the vasculature and stromal elements involved in tumor microenvironments (e.g., tumor cells, fibroblasts and blood vessels). The model also facilitates control of tumor cell migration and angiogenesis by creating
    chemical gradients of growth factors using 3D printed stimuli-responsive capsules. Altogether, this approach recapitulates physiological cell–to-cell, cell–to-extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell–to-chemical signal interactions with
    precise spatiotemporal resolution. In addition, the constructs consist of human cells, rendering them more clinically relevant and versatile with the option to incorporate a patient\'s own cells for precise selection of effective
    therapies.This innovation provides a powerful tool for understanding the mechanism of cancer metastasis, screening drugs and testing patient specific therapies.

    This technology is a noninvasive hearing multiplexing device that uses ultrasound signals to transmit audible sounds by exploiting cochlear regions that are under-utilized. The device, which is attached to the head/neck region, sends
    modulated ultrasonic signals to vibrate brain fluids. This vibration, in turn, produces audible sound signals in channels that are typically not used. As the signals are sent as vibrations through brain fluid, the airborne sound coming
    through the ear canal remains undisturbed. In other words, the device can be used to perform multiplexing with the cochlea to send desired sound signals in new perceptual channels without affecting normal hearing.
</p>
,
<p>
    Humans can hear sound signals in frequency ranging from 20Hz to 20kHz. However, some frequencies in this range are attenuated by the outer/middle ear (e.g., below 100Hz and above 8kHz). The technology described here uses modulated
    ultrasonic signals to enable hearing in those under-used frequencies. Multiple transmitters can be used to simultaneously stimulate different regions of the cochlea without distorting airborne sound. Such a technology can be utilized to
    send speech or other useful sound signals in a noisy environment, such as construction sites, war zone, or manufacturing facilities. This technology can be integrated with cell phones and other consumer products. This technology may
    also be used to develop new types of music production that combines normal sound along with ultrasound hearing. The device and accompanying algorithm can be optimized based on individual’s hearing preference and anatomy.

    \nNon-invasive techniques to reversibly modulate neural activity can be valuable in research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications. Researchers at the University of Minnesota recently discovered that transcranial low-intensity
    focused ultrasound (tFUS) can reversibly suppress evoked-responses and modulate functions within the nervous system. This technology uses a high-precision dual-mode, phased-array ultrasound system to deliver tFUS neuromodulation signals
    to target nervous tissues with high spatial resolution (voxel size: &lt; 2 cubic mm). Using specific parameters, tFUS can reversibly modulate neural activity by non-invasively heating a spatially-restricted volume of neural tissue
    without histological damage. This technology has also been shown to have superior temporal and spatial resolution when compared to other neuromodulation platforms, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct
    current stimulation (tcDCS). \n<br />
    \nProfessor Emad Ebbini’s team has demonstrated suppression of somatosensory-evoked potentials using tFUS in rodents. Activity suppression is found to be highly correlated and temporally consistent with <i>in vivo</i> temperature
    changes. Noninvasive heating of spatially-restricted volume of neural tissue without damage may provide a method of temporarily suppressing specific neural pathways or controlling networks through multiple foci. This technology may also
    be useful in investigating the basis of disease and neural function. Focused thermal neuromodulation pairs a method of noninvasive investigation of the underlying locations and networks of diseases of the central nervous system with a
    monitored treatment platform.\n

    Due to its health benefits, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding infants for a minimum of one year, a goal that only 35% of babies in the US reach. A barrier to breastfeeding for many mothers is the difficulty in
    pumping milk, a practice commonly cited as inefficient, time-consuming and both physically and socially uncomfortable. This is in large part due to the currently commercially available breast pumps that stimulate milk production using
    suction. These pumps are noisy, require a user to partially disrobe and necessitates access to a power outlet; physically isolating women from carrying out tasks and fully participating in the work-place. Compounding the problem, these
    pumps poorly mimic infant’s stimulation of milk and many women report increased discomfort and decreased milk output, which adds to the challenges.
</p>
,
<p>
    A group of researchers at the University of Minnesota’s Medical Devices Center have come up with a solution to take the “suck” out of pumping, literally. They have developed a concealed, wearable breast pump that uses mechanical
    compression (instead of vacuum suction) and warmth to mimic infant stimulation for milk expression. The mechanical stimulation (which uses data-determined pressure and pattern specifications), is capable of increasing milk output and
    also allows the pump to operate quietly compared to vacuum driven pumps.The pump is also designed as a wearable device that can be concealed under clothing, facilitating a woman to pump discreetly while continuing to carry out tasks in
    the workplace or the home. This technology empowers mothers to more fully engage in their careers and daily lives while still prioritizing their baby by lessening the physical and opportunity costs associated with pumping milk.

    This technology encompasses novel vaccine adjuvants with limited systemic exposure. The development of vaccines based on antigen subunits have been plagued by struggles with inducing the necessary T-cell response to confer protection
    while maintaining minimal toxicity. This technology overcomes these challenges using a two-pronged approach. First, the use of novel agonists for TLR7 and TLR8 trigger a prominent T-cell response. Second, conjugation of these agonists
    to a biomolecule that is trafficked to lymph nodes elicits focused immunostimulation. The sum product is a covalent conjugate that is “immune silent” until it travels to the lymph node where it is unmasked, leading to potent adjuvantic
    effects with negligible systemic exposure.
</p>
,
<p>
    Due to their ability to stimulate strong T-cell responses, TLR7 and TLR8 agonists have been prime targets for development as adjuvants. Unfortunately, their propensity to diffuse out of the vaccination site and cause systemic exposure
    and toxicity has been a major drawback. This technology identified novel TLR7/TLR8 stimulating compounds (C2-phenolic imidazoquinoline derivatives) and conjugated them to Hyaluronic Acid (HA) for targeting to lymph nodes. Other
    technologies have attempted similar lymph node delivery, but the strategies or compounds employed to do so are often incredibly complex. HA as a natural biopolymer is optimal for this purpose, with ideal biodegradability,
    biocompatibility and an excellent clinical track record. HA also serves to mask the reactive portions of the agonists and the adjuvant remains unreactive until it is delivered to the target lymphoid tissue and unmasked.

    Adjuvants are required to potentiate the immune response to increase efficacy and longevity of many vaccines. The need for new adjuvants is becoming increasingly recognized. The few adjuvants that are commercially available fall into a
    small number of classes, and the creation of new adjuvants has been hindered by issues of toxicity. Using systematic high-throughput screening, the very first heterocyclic small molecule capable of simulating the immune receptor TLR-2
    was identified. Through stimulation of cytokines and chemokines, this molecule (9-fluoro-7-hydroxy-3-methyl5-oxo-N-(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H,5H-pyrido [3,2,1-ij]quinoline-6-carboxamide) is available for development as an
    adjuvant in vaccines as well as in the treatment of certain cancers.
</p>
,
<p>
    Currently, the two most common adjuvants are aluminum- or lipopeptide- based. Aluminum alone is a poor inducer of T-cell response, which is necessary particularly for protein or subunit based vaccines. While lipopetide-based adjuvants
    are much better at priming T-cells to respond to introduced antigen, they suffer from problems of aggregation, which complicates their purification and characterization. This technology has the potential to overcome both of these
    hurdles through activation of TLR-2 via a novel structure (avoiding issues of aggregation). This class of compounds has the potential to serve as a potent adjuvant (alone or in combination) for a wide variety of vaccines; reducing the
    antigen concentration required in vaccines as well as the overall number of immunizations necessary to confer protection, leading to more cost effective vaccines. TLR-2 stimulating compounds have also shown promise for potentiating
    T-cell responses against tumors making this molecule a prime target for development as an anti-cancer therapeutic.

    While wearables, such as FitBit and other activity trackers, are useful for tracking and recording user’s physical and sleep activities, annotation and effective interpretation of data requires expertise. Moreover, evaluation of
    longitudinal activity data is done only in retrospect. Recently, researchers at the University of Minnesota developed a data mining and machine learning approach to optimize a prediction framework, that anticipates sleep quality
    beforehand. By evaluating a person’s physical activities over time, the algorithm recommends a set of activities to improve the quality of the individual\'s sleep.
</p>
,
<p>
    Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for clinical sleep diagnosis, and requires multiple sensors to track brain activity, body movement, heart rate, breathing frequency, and O2 levels. While PSG provides high-fidelity data,
    accuracy can be low because patients are required to sleep in the hospital, missing the more accurate picture of a patient’s behavior in familiar settings. Wearables on the other hand, can track sleep and physical activities
    (actigraphy) around-the-clock in familiar settings. This recommender system was developed to evaluate actigraphy data of individuals using human activity recognition algorithms. After evaluation, the algorithm can identify behavioral
    patterns that lead to good or poor quality sleep. These patterns are then used as target behavior, to ensure a good night\'s sleep. This machine learning algorithm can be integrated with existing wearables to predict and recommend
    highly personalized behavioral changes to improve the individual’s quality of sleep.

    This medical device is a modular vaginal dilation and flushing device that helps improve patient compliance and prevent serious postoperative complications associated with vaginoplasty. Patient compliance is improved by reducing the
    number of painful dilation and douching procedures required during the 90-days post-op period. The device can be used for preventing both acute and chronic post-op complications, including risks of infection, necrosis due to uneven
    pressure, vaginal stenosis, and neovaginal prolapse.
</p>
,
<p>
    By exploiting a stent design, the device reduces severe complications caused by vaginal packing with lubricated gauze, and frequent insertion and removal of hard plastic dilators. This all-in-one modular device replaces lubricated
    gauze, plastic dilators, and the douching mechanisms that are commonly used in perioperative and postoperative period following a vaginoplasty procedure. The device is designed to simultaneously provide uniform radial support to the
    neovaginal cavity as well as facilitate douching procedures. The flexible stent layer and soft external layer reduces pain during dilation/cleaning procedures, thereby improving patient compliance and reducing the risk of tissue trauma,
    infection, skin slough or vaginal prolapse. Channels built in the device promote coating of douching fluid to the entire neovagina, providing a better clean than typical douching.

    A smartphone app (iTorsion) for diagnosis of ocular torsion by physicians. It is not intended for self-diagnosis by patients. Patients wear standard red/green glasses. While holding the smartphone perpendicular to the ground, the
    patient should predominantly see one line out of each eye. The patient is asked to make the lines parallel with each other and with the ground. After finishing the test, the app will report the degree of extorsion and intorsion for each
    of the patient’s eyes.
</p>

<p>
    Ocular torsion affects thousands of people in the United States. Traditional diagnostic methods often require special equipment (e.g., Double Maddox Rod) and lack precision. The iTorsion app offers a simpler and more precise method to
    diagnose the problem. iTorsion requires only a smartphone and red/green glasses.

    New enhanced-affinity MHCII molecules could improve current research tools for the study of CD4 T cells during cancer, infections, and autoimmune disease. A novel process uses directed evolution to create modified MHCII molecules with
    better binding affinity than their wild-type counterparts for the co-receptor CD4 found on T cell surfaces.
</p>
,
<p>
    Current methods for detecting and understanding specific types of T cells are imperfect. A CD4 T cell uses its unique T-cell receptor (TCR) molecules to bind to a foreign peptide embedded in an MHCII molecule on host cells. At the same
    time, the T cell’s CD4 molecules bind to the stalk of the MHCII molecules and cooperate with the TCR to activate the T cell. Peptide:MHCII tetramer-based flow cytometry is a preferred method for the study of CD4 T cells specific for
    MHCII-bound peptides from microbes, cancers, and autoantigens. Unfortunately, peptide:MHCII tetramers do not bind to CD4 molecules and therefore fail to detect CD4 T cells with low affinity TCRs. This new technology creates a new
    generation of modified MHCII molecules evolved to bind CD4 with stronger affinity than wild-type MHCII molecules. Tetramers formed with peptide-bound CD4 affinity-enhanced MHCII tetramers detect T cells that are missed by peptide-bound
    wild-type MHCII tetramers. This technology allows researchers to detect more relevant T cells than currently possible.

    New membrane-permeable synthetic peptides could slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. These new peptides inhibit tau phosphorylation by targeting specific and multiple phosphorylation sites. This halts
    disease progression by inhibiting tau mislocalization to dendritic spines and subsequent tau-mediated neural deficits. The technology is anticipated to treat Alzheimer’s disease and other tau-associated neurodegenerative conditions
    (e.g., frontotemporal dementia, traumatic brain injury, chronic traumatic encephalopathy).
</p>
,
<p>
    Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has two main pathological hallmarks: beta-amyloid (Aβ) forming plaques and neurofibrillary tangles containing phosphorylated tau protein. No therapeutics currently exist that can slow or stop AD progression.
    Hyperphosphorylation of tau is associated with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Preventing hyperphosphorylation has become a key strategy. Previous attempts to treat AD by blocking tau phosphorylation failed because inhibiting
    the kinases (including CDK5 and GSK3) also shuts down other necessary cellular processes, leading to high toxicity. These two new peptides (termed WT and AP) prevent tau hyperphosphorylation. They act as targets for kinases so they do
    not hyperphosphorylate the tau protein. The WT peptide acts as a competitive inhibitor for the two kinases; the peptide becomes phosphorylated and native tau is not hyperphosphorylated. The AP modified peptide is unable to be
    phosphorylated but instead binds with the kinases, essentially “distracting” the kinases from native tau by so they phosphorylate native tau to a lesser extent. Because the peptides do not affect the global kinase activities of CDK5 and
    GSK3, they are likely to be highly effective without high toxicity.

    A fast, simple and accurate quality control test can determine water quality where a very dilute level of contamination by pathogenic bacteria is suspected. The test uses a novel dielectrophoresis (DEP) step that concentrates and
    recovers a high fraction of bacteria. Then, inactivated free DNA from no-longer-viable bacteria allows nucleic acid amplification technology to measure DNA concentrations from only the pathogenic species. The DEP step improves bacterial
    recovery enough that smaller quantities of water can be used, and the unique nucleic acid primers identify specific genes of the live, pathogenic bacteria without also tagging other bacteria. This technology can be used for endoscope
    reprocessing quality testing: an area of particular concern due to the recent number of patient infections and deaths caused by cross-contamination of incompletely processed endoscopes.
</p>
,
<p>
    Monitoring water quality is important not only for municipal water suppliers but also in the medical field. In particular, measuring water quality of rinsate from medical instrumentation (e.g., endoscopes) can determine if a device has
    been cleaned adequately. A key requirement is the ability to detect small quantities of pathogens (i.e., as low as 1 CFU/mL of sample), and to do so quickly enough to determine if rinse water needs further treatment or medical devices
    need more cleaning. Current water tests that measure metabolic pathway components as a proxy for the presence of organisms are limited in that these markers are not specific to pathogens or viable bacteria, and the tests are not
    sensitive at the low levels required. Other tests that culture samples from water require a 12 to 48 hour incubation before producing results, too long a wait for many applications. This new test is fast, simple and accurate. It works
    with dilute levels of pathogenic bacterial contamination as well as with smaller water samples.

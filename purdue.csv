Compounds with Combined Cancer Drug Scaffolds Inhibit Cancer Cell Proliferation at Nanomolar Concentrations,"Purdue University researchers have developed compounds that are anti-proliferative against multiple cancer cell types. Cancer results from genetic alterations that impose uncontrolled proliferation of cells. Therefore, developing molecules to debilitate cellular proliferation would prove an effective treatment for cancers. Purdue researchers optimized a synthetic method to quickly synthesize a library of compounds containing combined cancer drug scaffolds via a multi-component Povarov reaction. The researchers investigated the anti-proliferative effects of the compounds by a primary screen in the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cell line. Analogs of the most potent compounds were further tested against the NCI-60 cancer cell panel and exhibited anti-proliferative effects on melanoma, leukemia, breast, lung, and renal cancer cell lines with GI50 values at sub micromolar concentrations. These molecules are also promising because they have a high fraction of sp3 carbons increasing their drug like characteristics. The compounds' potency toward multiple cancer cell lines and drug like properties make them promising candidates for future therapeutic development.Advantages: -Combined Anti-Cancer Scaffold-Easily Synthesized Compounds-Increased Drug-Like CharacteristicsApplications: -Cancer Therapies-Cancer Relapse TherapiesRelated Publication:HSD1787, a Tetrahydro-3H-Pyrazolo[4,3-f]Quinoline Compound Synthesized via Povarov Reaction, Potently Inhibits Proliferation of Cancer Cell Lines at Nanomolar ConcentrationsACS Omega 2020, 5, 37, 23799-23807DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.0c03001"
Targeting T Cells in Tumor Microenvironments through Immunotherapy,"Researchers at Purdue University have created a ligand-targeted drug for reprogramming the body's immune system to eliminate cancer. This targeting strategy introduces a new frontier in medicinal chemistry and cancer therapeutics. Currently, cancer cells rather than immune cells in the tumor microenvironment are studied to develop therapies for solid tumors. However, immunoinhibiting regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are abundant in tumor microenvironments, can have greater potential to regenerate anti-tumor immunity. The approach developed by Purdue University involves the reprogramming of Tregs using of a targeting molecule with specificity for Tregs that can deliver an attached inhibitory drug solely to Tregs. Uptake of this inhibitory drug by the tumor Tregs then blocks the Tregs immunosuppressive properties and thereby allows the patient's immune system to eradicate the tumor. By targeting the therapeutic drug in this manner, the immunoinhibiting function of Tregs can be silenced without changing the immune system elsewhere in the body. Advantages:-Strong binding affinity-Small molecule treatment of tumors-Reprograms the immune systemPotential Applications:-Cancer Therapy-Molecular Medicinal Chemistry-Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing"
Bone Fracture Repair by Targeting of Bone Anabolic Agents,"Current research on healing bone fractures either focuses on localized application of a nontargeted bone anabolic agent or a systematic administration of a nontargeted bone anabolic agent that have off-target effects. Both methods lack the desired efficiency and effectivity to treat bone fractures.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a targeted bone anabolic agent capable of accelerated fracture healing. By using a construct that self-assembles into micelles, the technology targets bone fractures to a greater extent than healthy bone, releases drug under physiological conditions, and accelerates fracture healing. This technology utilizes a nontoxic acidic oligopeptide that increases accumulation of the drug in fractures, reduces the accumulation in healthy tissue, and uses a cleavable linker to extend the release of the drug in the fracture site, resulting in faster fracture healing.Advantages-Nontoxic acidic oligopeptide increases accumulation of the drug in fractures and decreases drug accumulation in healthy tissue. Potential Applications:-Medical/Health-Orthopedics-Pharmaceuticals"
Potent Small Molecule PD-1/PD-L1 Interaction Inhibitors for Cancer Immunotherapy,"Purdue University researchers have developed a potent small molecule for use in cancer immunotherapy which acts by inhibiting the Programmable Cell Death Protein 1/Programmable Death-Ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) interaction. Cancer cells express PD-L1, a cell surface protein that binds to PD-1 on T-cells, debilitating anti-cancer immunity.  Antibodies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction have proven to be a viable therapeutic strategy toward mitigating cancer growth but suffer from high production costs, limited administration techniques, and low therapeutic indices. To address these limitations, Purdue University researchers created a small molecule inhibitor of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction that specifically target PD-1 dimerization. The researchers developed the new molecule through robust computational modeling of publicly available PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory data. In homogenous time-resolved fluorescence binding assays the Purdue compound exhibited about 1.6 fold increased potency in inhibiting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction compared to a positive control molecule known from the patent literature (IC50 = 339.9 nM and 521.5 nM, respectively). Further medicinal chemistry optimization promises to increase potency and yield an excellent preclinical candidate for use in small molecule immune checkpoint blockade therapy.Advantages:-Increased Potency to PD-1/PD-L1 Interaction-Combined Scaffolds of BMS CompoundsPotential Applications:-Immune Checkpoint Blockade-Cancer Therapeutics Related Publication:Combined Molecular Graph Neural Network and Structural Docking Selects Potent Programmable Cell Death Protein 1/Programmable Death-Ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) Small Molecule InhibitorsPreprint available at chemrixiv.orgDOI: 10.26434/chemrxiv.12083907.v1"
Weaponizing Ubiquitin to Target Ubiquitin-C Terminal Hydrolase L1,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a ubiquitin protein mutant that will selectively bind Ubiquitin C-Terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) enzyme over all other deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) expressed in cells. The ubiquitination process involves adding the ubiquitin protein to substrate proteins. This protein conjugation event can have different cellular effects on the substrate protein depending on the location and length of the ubiquitin linkages. DUBs are proteins that are responsible for cleaving ubiquitin linkages to maintain ubiquitin levels in the cell. One such enzyme, UCHL1, is overexpressed in a multitude of aggressive cancers and is involved with neurological diseases like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. However, the specific role UCHL1 plays in these disease states remains enigmatic.  Researchers at Purdue University have developed a macromolecular ubiquitin mutant for probing UCHL1's activity in a cellular environment. This technology offers a novel approach to studying UCHL1's role in certain disease states by probing intracellular UCHL1 activity in real time, a feat that has not been accomplished with any deubiquitinating enzyme.  Also, this technology can be repurposed to provide a covalent macromolecular inhibitor of UCHL1, providing another layer of novelty to UCHL1 activity studies.Advantages:-UCHL1 Selective Probe -Real Time UCHL1 Activity Assay -Multi-Disease RelevancePotential Applications:-Probe Intracellular UCHL1"
Selective Reprogramming of Pulmonary Macrophages for Treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed molecular agonists to reverse idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) by reprograming fibrotic macrophages to the non-fibrotic state. IPF is a lung disease that is characterized by rigidification of the lung resulting and a gradual loss in ability to mediate gas exchange leaving patients in a hypoxic state that increases gradually over the course of the disease. Current treatment options for IPF are only able to slow the rate of disease progression and none are able to reverse the existing fibrosis. With around 40,000 new cases of IPF diagnosed each year, a curative treatment option would be beneficial in treating IPF. Activated macrophages and activated fibroblasts are two cell types play a prominent from in IPF. Activated macrophages secrete signals that activate lung fibroblasts, the cells responsible for fibrotic tissue generation. Therefore, shutting down the activated macrophage secretion signals would provide a potential curative treatment option for IPF. Researchers at Purdue University have identified molecules that target Toll-like receptor 7 selectively on the macrophage surface to shut down signals secreted that activate fibroblasts. These molecules have been tested in histological and mouse models.Advantages:-Selective targeting of fibrotic macrophagesPotential Applications:-Reverse idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-Possible combination therapy with existing therapeutics"
Water Soluble Human Calcitonin for Treatment of Osteoporosis and Calcium-related Disorders,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a prodrug form of the peptide hormone, human calcitonin, to increase its effectiveness as an osteoporosis treatment. In humans, calcitonin is the hormone responsible for normal calcium homeostasis. When prescribed to osteoporosis patients, calcitonin inhibits bone resorption resulting in increased bone mass. Unfortunately, human calcitonin undergoes fibrillation in aqueous solution leading to reduced efficacy when used as a therapeutic. As a substitute, osteoporosis patients are prescribed salmon calcitonin which does not fibrillate as rapidly but suffers from low potency and immunotoxicity. To decrease the fibrillation propensity and increase the therapeutic benefit of human calcitonin, Purdue researchers phosphorylated specific amino acid residues. This modification's ability to inhibit fibril formation was validated in comparison to the unphosphorylated calcitonin through thioflavin T- fluorescence, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and circular dichroism. This prodrug approach will increase the therapeutic potential of human calcitonin, promising a more effective option to replace salmon calcitonin for osteoporosis and related disorders.Advantages:-Stable solution of human calcitonin-Higher potency than salmon calcitonin-Less toxicity than salmon calcitoninPotential Applications:-Drug Development-Osteoporosis Treatment-Hypercalcemia Treatment"
Nanoparticle Chemotherapeutic Delivery System that Aids in Development of Antitumor Immunity,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a nanoparticle-based system for sustained release of chemotherapeutic drugs at low doses that leaves antitumor immune cells with full functionality. Chemotherapy has been a mainstay in cancer treatment because of the anti-proliferative effects it imposes on tumor cells. Several chemotherapeutic treatment options result in generation of cancer antigens that aid in the activation of the host’s antitumor immune response. Paradoxically, these treatment options also damage immune cells, diminishing their antitumor effect. In response to this shortcoming of traditional chemotherapies, Purdue’s researchers developed a system to deliver chemotherapeutics and keep immune cells healthy. Their nanoparticle delivery system also elicits an enhanced immunogenic response compared to other chemotherapeutic delivery options along with increasing the metabolic stability and tumor retention of chemotherapeutic drugs. The chemotherapeutic, carfilzomib, formulated with this delivery system showed consistently greater antitumor effects against two tumor types in a mouse model compared to the cyclodextrin-solubilized drug.Advantages-Sustained Release of Chemotherapeutic Drug-Enhanced Immune Response-Increased Drug Metabolic Stability Potential Applications-Chemotherapy-Cancer TreatmentRelated Publication:Sustained Delivery of Carfilzomib by Tannic Acid-Based Nanocapsules Helps Develop Antitumor ImmunityNano Lett. 2019, 19, 11, 8333-8341DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b04147Domain: Pharmaceuticals"
Anti-bacterial Compounds to Treat Neisseria gonorrhoeae Infections,"Purdue University researchers have identified a class of compounds for use in treating gonorrhea infection. Strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterial agent responsible for gonorrhea infections, resistant to most contemporarily used antibiotics are becoming more prevalent. This fact has made gonorrhea a national and international health crisis as health agencies around the world consider gonorrhea a serious threat. To make matters even worse, major pharmaceuticals companies often abandon antibiotics research projects due to non-profitability. Thus new compounds have to be identified to combat this gonorrhea superbug. ​Researchers at Purdue University identified a class of compounds that kill Neisseria gonorrhoeae cells. The researchers screened the most potent compounds against a panel of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains. Three compounds exhibited potent activity against the Neisseria gonorrhoeae panel with the most potent having MIC values of 0.25 – 2 micrograms per milliliter. These compounds show promise for treatment of gonorrhea across the world and could help alleviate the growing concern of antimicrobial resistance.Advantages:-Novel neisseria gonnorrhea treatment optionPotential Applications:-Antimicrobial resistance-Decreasing spread of STDs"
Targeted Therapeutic for Metastatic Prostate Cancer,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a targeted therapeutic option for treating metastatic prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. The cancer often metastasizes into the bone; however, treatment options targeting advanced metastatic prostate cancer are few, leaving patients with a poor prognosis. The Purdue researchers' technology targets both the primary tumor and the metastatic sites with the goal of patients' increased survival.The Purdue technology is a gene therapy that delivers a protein conjugate combining a therapeutic cytokine suited for treating metastatic cancer with a peptide that specifically targets tumor tissue. This technology was tested in an ex vivo mouse model and showed 10-fold increase in binding to tumor cells relative to normal cells. Expression of this conjugate in a mouse model displays an 89 percent decrease in prostate tumor growth rate relative to the control. In addition, the researchers observed upregulation of genes associated with immune cell trafficking suggesting delivery of this conjugate has a beneficial impact on both targeted cells and neighboring cells at metastatic sites.Advantages:-Designed for Advanced Stage Cancer Treatment-Targeted to Tumor Cells-Enhances Expression of Immunogenic GenesPotential Applications:-Prostate Cancer-Metastatic Control-Bone RepairRelated Publication:Ligand-Mediated Targeting of Cytokine Interleukin-27 Enhances Its Bioactivity In VivoMol Ther Methods Clin Dev. 2020;17:739-751doi:10.1016/j.omtm.2020.03.022"
Novel Adenylyl Cyclase 1 Inhibitors for Treatment of Chronic Pain,"Researchers at Purdue University have synthesized compounds to treat chronic pain by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1), an effector of the opioid receptor. Opioids are currently the most widely used drugs to treat chronic pain, but their use is commonly associated with addiction and dependency. A contributing factor to opioid dependence is cAMP overproduction in neurons. The Purdue researchers have identified compounds that potently and selectively inhibit AC1, the enzyme responsible for that overproduction of cAMP in neurons. The most selective compound displays 150x selectivity for AC1 over AC8, a homologous enzyme. These AC1-selective compounds provide a novel treatment option for pain. Additionally, because cAMP is linked to the opioid receptors, these compounds could be used when transitioning individuals off opioids.Advantages:-Novel Chronic Pain Treatment Option -Limits Opioid Dependence and AddictionPotential Applications:-Non-opioid Analgesic-Opioid Addiction Treatment-Chronic Pain Management"
Novel Therapeutic for Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a conjugated antibiotic therapeutic in which kanamycin is conjugated to an anti-microbial peptide. The conjugated antibiotic has the ability to disrupt the biofilm resulting in kanamycin entering the cell. Once conjugated kanamycin enters the cell, the linkage between kanamycin and the peptide is broken due to the reducing environment of the cell cytosol. Synergistic anti-microbial activity of conjugated kanamycin was observed for both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Whereas, the antibacterial activity was significantly less for either kanamycin or peptide alone. In vitro experiments showed that the kanamycin conjugate was more effective at killing 3 antibiotic resistant strains of ESKAPE pathogens than conventional treatments: vancomycin, linezolid, and kanamycin.Advantages: -Conjugate between 2 molecules with antibacterial activityPotential Applications: -Antibiotic drug delivery-Antibiotic drug designRelated Publications: Mohamed, Mohamed F., et al.

Activity-Based Probes with Unnatural Amino Acids to Monitor the Proteasome in Living Cells,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a set of activity-based probes which have shown improved fluorescence properties and selectivity towards the proteasome compared to other cellular proteases.  They have included unnatural amino acids and have found probes which can be utilized in various applications, including monitoring the effects of small molecule stimulators of the proteasome in live cells and comparing the relative proteasome activity across different cancer cell types. Advantages:-Improved Proteasome Sensitivity-Cell-Based Assay CompatibilityPotential Applications:-High throughput assays-Finding Proteasome Stimulators and Inhibitors"
Combination Pharmaceutical Formulations ,"Lower respiratory infections (or lung infections) is one of the leading causes of death in both developing and developed countries. Traditional administrations of antibiotics happen through oral or intravenous methods. These two methods in many causes are not effective for treatment of lower respiratory infections because drugs cannot reach infections sites in the airway surfaces. Furthermore, oral or intravenous medicines have problems with synergy of more than two antibiotics because different drugs have different behaviors. This means the drugs will arrive at the infections site at different times. This leads to compromised antimicrobial activity and potential development of antimicrobial resistance. There is a need for a new technology that allows for a more efficient way to deliver these antibiotics to the infected areas in the airways for treatment of deadly lung infections.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that solves the compromised antimicrobial efficacy with traditional oral or intravenous administrations. This new technology incorporates two or more synergistic components into a single particle which allows for simultaneous delivery with high efficiency to the infection area in the lungs. This maximizes the antimicrobial activity and minimize resistance development. There is also reduced local toxicity because of this technology. The addition of one component will improve the delivery efficiency and stabilize the other component. This new technology could open the door for much better therapies for treatment of dangerous lung infections.  Advantages: -Maximized antimicrobial activity-Minimized antimicrobial resistance-Reduced local toxicity-Improved delivery efficiency-Stabilized other componentPotential Applications: -Antimicrobial activity-Antibiotics-Respiratory infections"
Generation of Hematopoietic Stem Cells from In Vitro Origin,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new means to efficiently generate hematopoietic stem cells for use in blood diseases, cancer therapy and regenerative medicine. Humans generate specific red and white blood cell types from a common precursor, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). HSC transplantation is an important therapeutic option for many blood diseases, cancers and immunodeficiencies, replacing diseased blood cell populations. However, HSCs are currently in short supply as they are typically extracted from humans. The Purdue University researchers have responded to this need by developing a serum-free, in vitro directed differentiation protocol to generate human HSCs from pluripotent stem cells. These HSCs have been proven capable of generating white and red blood cell progeny. In further validation of this technology, the HSCs implanted into zebrafish embryos colonized the hematopotietic tissues of the growing chimeric fish. Altogether, this technology provides a needed step towards production of HSCs to treat patients suffering from blood diseases, cancer and immunodeficient conditions.Advantages:-Increased HSC production-No human blood or serum needed-Cost-effective and reproduciblePotential Applications-Biomanufacturing-Cell Therapy-Cancer Treatment-Regenerative Medicine"
"Peptide Antibiotics Targeting Intracellular Pathogens
","Antimicrobial resistant microorganisms are those that have lost sensitivity to one or more antimicrobial drugs. The World Health Organization recognizes antimicrobial resistance as a current global threat that has an economic impact of about three times the direct healthcare expenditures or about 1 percent of Gross Domestic Product. The growing risks of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, especially antibiotic resistant bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, necessitate the development of a new generation of antibiotics. Posing an additional challenge to drug design, many bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella, Listeria, and Brucella, also have the ability to inhabit human cells, often macrophages.Purdue University researchers have developed a broad-spectrum antibiotic that effectively enters human cells. This synthetic, proline-rich antimicrobial peptide has proven to kill a number of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including MRSA. This peptide effectively invades macrophages and exhibits strong intracellular activity while causing no damage to red blood cells as compared to most antimicrobial peptides. This effective peptide antibiotic shows promise as a candidate in the fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria.Advantages:-Effective against antimicrobial resistant bacteria including, MRSA-Does not damage red blood cells-Enters human macrophagesPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical industry-Drug development for antibiotic-resistant bacteria"
Nanoparticles for Intracorporeal Sepsis Treatment,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed bio-compatible nanoparticles to treat sepsis systemically. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 33 percent of hospital mortality in the United States is due to sepsis, a disease that occurs when bacterial endotoxins circulate in the bloodstream and trigger the immune system to attack the body. Available treatments largely rely on targeting the bacteria or providing life support, none of which directly clear endotoxins. Others have proposed treatments based on different nanoparticle systems; however, those technologies are not suitable for systemic treatment and would require invasive techniques of  extracorporeal blood cleansing. Purdue researchers designed a new solution to sepsis, which can be administered systemically and safely. In mouse models of sepsis, 100 percent of the animals treated with the new nanoparticle system survived while none of the animals in the control group survived. Compared to other exploratory solutions to combat sepsis, the Purdue technology promises a safe and convenient option for both patients and physicians.Advantages:-Inactivation of endotoxin-Prevention of excessive inflammation-Protection from polymicrobial peritonitisPotential Applications: -Sepsis treatment"
Small Molecule Proteasome Stimulators of Proteasome for Protein Degradation to Treat Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases ,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed small molecule stimulators of the enzyme responsible for routine protein degradation, the 20S core particle of the proteasome (20S CP). The researchers were motivated to develop 20S CP stimulators as a pharmaceutical intervention to degrade the damaged and disordered proteins associated with a variety of disease states including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The hit compound discovered by Purdue's researchers stimulates catalytic activity of the 20S CP. This stimulator molecule increased the degradation of a peptide probe as well as several full-length proteins by the 20S CP versus a control without the stimulator. In a cell line expressing alpha-synuclein, a protein found aggregated in neurodegenerative diseases, the stimulator enhanced degradation of this protein 200-300 percent. The researchers are now developing derivatives of the hit compound towards a new therapeutic lead. These new molecules pave the way for a drug to prevent debilitating and life-threatening diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.Advantages:-Stimulates 20S core of the proteasome-Selective for 20S CP versus 26S proteasomePotential Applications-Treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases-Treatment for aging and disease processes associated with protein aggregation"
Perimeter Fill Syringes for Safe Use,"In healthcare, along with proper procedures, administering medications correctly and at proper dosage is vital for both patients and health care providers. Administering an inappropriate dose can be serious and result in adverse drug reactions, sub-par therapeutic effect, or even death. One such drug that has a critical need to be dosed appropriately to achieve a therapeutic effect is insulin for the treatment of Diabetes, given with injections. Conventional syringes have a hollow barrel and a solid plunger that is used to push fluid through the tip. Since insulin is dosed in small volumes and the barrels are narrow, it is difficult for patients to handle the syringe and read markings appropriately, which can cause multiple potentially fatal mix-ups. Thus, there is an unmet need for syringes to allow safe and reliable administration of a drug. Although programs and advertising campaigns are available to help educate patients about syringes with high concentration insulin, this has thus far not resulted in reliably accurate administration practices.At Purdue University, researchers have strived to overcome this problem and have developed a series of perimeter fill safety syringes. The syringe features a novel design that allows better accuracy and safety in the administration of concentrated doses of insulin. These syringes use a solid core. Fluid fills an area around the perimeter of the barrel. This smaller filling space provides a wider diameter for the barrel, thus increasing the visibility of the markings and allowing for better handling by the patient or health care provider. Another feature of this design is that the geometry improves safety during use, for example, designating rectangle shaped syringes for higher concentrations and the traditional cylindrical shape for lower concentrations. Additionally, these syringes have greater diameter that permits better grip, larger print, and easier manipulation. This technology can be applied not only to insulin administration but to medications of all types that are to be administered via a syringe. Hence, this would greatly reduce medication errors from the use of injectable syringes. Advantages:-Accurate administration of medication doses-Greater diameter for improved handling-Applies to multiple injectable medicationsPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Diabetes treatment"
Repurposed Drug for Clostridium Difficile Infection,"Researchers at Purdue University developed a repurposed drug as a potent inhibitor of Clostridium difficile. Clostridium difficile is the most common and costly healthcare-associated infection with an estimated half a million cases and approximately 29,000 deaths occurring annually in the United States. The rate of death associated with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is rising, and the infection is occurring in populations previously considered to be at low risk. Treatment with the standard of care falls short; after treatment, patients' intestines become colonized by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The repurposed drug is capable of killing hypervirulent strains of C. diff, suppressing C. diff spore formation, preventing VRE colonization, and avoiding absorption from the intestine. The drug is approved for its original indication outside of the US for oral consumption and in the US for topical application.Advantages:-Kills Clostridium difficile-Suppresses Clostridium difficile spore formation-Reduces vancomycin-resistant enterococci colonizationPotential Applications:-Treatment of Clostridium difficile infection"
New Solid State Forms of Thiamine,"Thiamine, or vitamin B1, is widely added to foods and to vitamin tablets. Two solid state forms are currently used commercially: thiamine chloride hydrochloride and thiamine mononitrate. The former is quite hygroscopic and is typically used in liquid formulations. The latter form is less hygroscopic, so is used in food powders. However, there is a public perception that nitrates are bad; hence, there is a potential market for alternative solid state forms of thiamine. Researchers at Purdue University have developed new solid state forms of thiamine through synthesis. These new forms are potentially less hygroscopic and are formed with more acceptable counterions. These thiamine solids help those in the food and nutraceutical industry who want to fortify foods and produce vitamin tablets. By adding thiamin forms that are chemically stable and acceptable to consumers, customers will be able to purchase products with better stability, longer shelf life, and will be able to consume more natural compounds unlike thiamine mononitrate or thiamine chloride hydrochloride.Advantages: -Better stability-Reduce degradation-More natural compoundsPotential Applications: -Food fortification-Vitamin tablets"
Bactericidal and Bacteriostatic Agents against Drug-Resistant Bacteria,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed novel antimicrobial agents to solve the continued problem of drug-resistant bacterial strains; approximately 20,000 people die in the US every year from drug-resistant infections. These antimicrobial agents potently inhibit bacterial growth in several species, including drug-resistant strains, at concentrations as low as 0.0675 micrograms per milliliter. This family of compounds contains both bactericidal and bacteriostatic agents.Advantages:-Inhibits drug resistant bacteria strains-Kills bacteria at low concentrationPotential Applications:-Antimicrobial AgentRelated Publication:Potent trifluoromethoxy, trifluoromethylsulfonyl, trifluoromethylthio and pentafluorosulfanyl containing (1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzamides against drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteriaRSC Med.

Faster and More Controlled RF Heating for Lyophilization Based on Statistical Electromagnetics,"Researcher at Purdue University have created a high power Radio Frequency Heating method that is controllable and optimal through statistical electromagnetism. Frequencies are selected based on type of material, frozen bulk is then uniformly heated volumetrically, and heat energy is distributed uniformly. The novel setup saves time, reduces energy consumption in the lyophilization process, and creates a product loss factor of less than one tenth for organic constituents. The advanced RF technique features an additional abrupt turn-off option for precise control of heating, relieving any need to adjust time, temperature, pressure, or shelf layouts for vials to obtain better results. Freeze drying can become considerably more efficient for pharmaceutical manufacturing and developing biotechnology.Advantages:-Heating uniformity -Selective heating within chamber -Less product loss -Saves time-Abrupt turn off feature   Potential Applications:-Pharmaceutical drug manufacturing-Biotechnology development-Food industry/freeze drying meats, coffee, etc."
"Potent, Selective Inhibitor of an Emerging Therapeutic Target for Cancer","Researchers at Purdue University have developed a selective and potent compound against an emerging therapeutic target, chromobox (CBX) 8, a protein identified as a potential oncogenic target in lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and leukemia. CBX8 is a member of a family of highly homologous proteins with binding pockets that are difficult to target with traditional small molecules. For those reasons, current CBX inhibitors display weak affinity and poor selectivity. The current molecules also exhibit limited cellular permeability and toxicity to many normal cell types. The Purdue researchers used a DNA-encoded chemical library to identify a new peptidomimetic ligand for CBX8. This compound offers high affinity of around 400-800 nM, is >5-20-fold more selective for CBX8 versus other family members, and is cell permeable. The ligand's mechanism of action was confirmed in cell culture. It inhibits growth of a mixed-lineage leukemia cell line, THP1, that is known to be CBX8-dependent but does not inhibit a control leukemia cell line, K562, with a different genetic driver. This inhibitor has the potential to help researchers and pharmaceutical companies better understand CBX8's potential as a therapeutic target to prevent cancer growth and chemotherapy resistance.  Advantages: -High affinity -Selectivity for CBX8 over other related proteins-Cell permeablePotential Applications: -Drug Development Related Publication:Optimization of Ligands Using Focused DNA-Encoded Libraries To Develop a Selective, Cell-Permeable CBX8 Chromodomain InhibitorACS Chem.

Reporter Molecule for Study of Alzheimer's Disease,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed pH-dependent fluorogenic amyloid-beta reporters for the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglial phagocytosis of amyloid-beta peptides is a critical step in the regulation of brain homeostasis during the initiation and progression of AD. Unlike common methods to study this phenomenon, this technology is specific for amyloid-beta and functions in live cells. The reporter, an isoform of human amyloid-beta tagged with a pH-dependent fluorogenic moiety, fluoresces only upon phagocytosis in the acidic intracellular phagosomes. It clearly differentiates between phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells within live human and nonhuman microglial cells. This technology promises to aid in the discovery of new therapeutics for AD.Advantages: -Facilitates live cell tracking of microglial phagocytosis-Differentiates between phagocytic and non-phagocytic microglial cellsPotential Applications: -Development of Alzheimer's Therapeutics"
Single Step Method for Heterocycle Synthesis,"N-heterocycles are contained in more than half of FDA-approved small-molecule therapeutics. These heterocycles are highly important for the development of new therapeutics. However, several heterocycles are difficult to access, and there is a significant lack of structural diversity of the heterocycles due to lack of efficient and limited methods to synthesize N-heterocycles. Therefore, there is need of a method for synthesizing heterocycles efficiently.  Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel strategy for rapidly synthesizing carbon-substituted heterocycles in one step. The reactions in the approach are optimized and utilize reagents that are cheap and readily available, eliminating the need for precious transition metal catalysts. In addition, products can be converted to more complex products, improving structural diversity further. This technology for producing nitrogen-containing heterocycles would help in numerous applications, including medicinal chemistry and the therapeutic drug discovery/development process.Advantages: -Single step-Inexpensive-Optimized reactions-Improved structural diversity Potential Applications:-Medicinal chemistry-Drug discovery-Therapeutic development"
Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors as Treatment for Gonorrhea   ,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new treatment for the drug resistant pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae. CDC has reported a 67% increase in gonorrhoea cases, a sexually transmitted disease, between 2013 and 2017. Pathogenic strains of gonorrhea are notorious for rapidly developing resistance to the current line of antibiotic treatments rendering them futile. The new treatment developed at Purdue leverages FDA approved carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) to develop novel analogs that are potent with a narrow spectrum of action to treat gonorrhea. These analogs target the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase in the bacteria, which is crucial for the bacteria to maintain CO2 and pH homeostasis. They do not target other commensal bacteria that are required to maintain healthy microbiome. Most importantly, their mechanism of action prevents the development of rapid antibiotic resistance. Advantages:-Selectively targets N. gonorrhea-Does not target gut and/or vaginal microbiota-Prevents rapid resistance development-Works synergistically with approved antibioticsPotential Applications:-Treatment of Gonorrhea and treating medical conditions related to  antibiotic resistant strains of N.gonorrhoeae."
New Class of Anticancer Chemotherapy Agents,"According to the National Cancer Institute, approximately 40 percent of people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime and worldwide number of diagnostics are predicted to increase nearly 50 percent by 2030. Nearly 2 percent of all men and 1.5 percent of all women are killed each year by cancer. Cancer is simply described as continuous and uncontrolled division of cells leading to tumors. With the increase in cancer cases worldwide and the lack of a consistent treatment, new development are still needed in the field.Researchers at Purdue University have synthesized a number of natural products that inhibit cell splicing. These herboxidiene derivatives inhibit cell division through its interactions with the proteins responsible for pre-mRNA splicing. This technology shows potential for use in a variety of select human cancers with increased functionality and consistent stability and potency. Advantages: -Stable and potent-Appropriate drug functionalities for conjugates Potential Applications: -Pharmaceuticals-Anticancer, chemotherapy drugs"
In vitro Model for Testing Efficacy and Neurotoxicity of Neurotherapeutic,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a physiologically relevant in vitro screening tool combining blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability testing with subsequent neuronal response to evaluate the effects of permeation on observed neuroactivity in one assay. Clinical translation of neurotheraputics significantly lags behind the rapid increase in neurological disorders seen worldwide. One of the primary hurdles to neurotherapeutic development is the blood brain barrier (BBB). Others have developed in vitro assays to emulate the BBB; however, the result of these assays does not translate to real efficacy, because the assays do not incorporate downstream neuroactivity or associated neurotoxicity as the Purdue technology does. Preliminary tests of the Purdue technology revealed it correctly rank-orders compounds compared to known parameters. The technology is versatile and can be adapted to utilize multiple cell types. The technology promises to reduce the resources needed for ranking hit and lead candidate compounds in the development of new neurotheraputic agents.Advantages-Promises to reduce time and cost associated with pharmaceutical development-Flexible system: adaptable to multiple cell types-Increased translational efficiencyPotential Applications-Neurotherapeutic drug development-Drug Discovery and Development"
Technique for Engineering Centimeter-size Model Tumors,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method that produces in vitro tumors in the centimeter-size range with relevant pathological traits. In contrast, current in vitro 3D cultures or ""microtumors"" typically yield cell aggregates less than 800 microns in size. Although these microtumors successfully mimic cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions observed in vivo, tumors in that size range are rarely detected in the clinic. Further, large engineered tumors produced by aggregation begin to die within a few hours. Larger, more stable in vitro models with clinically relevant architecture and cell phenotypes would be more relevant for testing drug delivery systems and other potential therapies. Bioprinting has been applied to the creation of large multicellular tumors that are reproducible and finely controllable; however, bioprinting requires high levels of expertise and access to expensive equipment. Using a simpler process, the Purdue researchers' tumors remain viable for weeks and have traits relevant to the clinical phenotype, including a heterogeneous composition consisting of both preinvasive and invasive phenotypes and a structure allowing for adequate diffusion of nutrients both within the construct and to an exogenous extracellular matrix.Advantages: -Large tumors with clinically relevant phenotype-Tumors can survive several days (even weeks)-Does not require access to a bioprinter or training on how to use a bioprinterPotential Applications:-Evaluation of drug delivery systems or other proposed therapies"
An optimized lyophilization process to minimize primary drying time,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method to optimize the lyophilization process parameters in real time to minimize the primary drying time. The measurement of vapor pressure with wireless sensors reduces process variable uncertainty and enables accelerated drying times. The shelf temperature can also be controlled to reduce the difference in drying time between the center and edge vials, creating more consistent drying. Furthermore, this technology operates on any computing device that supports the Python language.Advantages: -Minimize primary drying time-More consistent dryingPotential Applications:-Lyophilization"
Antibacterial Agents Effective Against Intracellular Pathogens,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed therapeutics against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that penetrate through host cells and retain their antibiotic activity, effectively reducing the intracellular MRSA levels with no adverse effects on the host. Antibiotic resistance is a global problem accruing a cost of $20 billion in associated medical costs and taking the lives of 23,000 patients in the US each year. MRSA is a bacterial infection that commonly acquires resistance through infecting macrophages and other phagocytic host cells. Many antibiotics used to treat MRSA, including vancomycin, cannot penetrate through host cell membranes at lethal doses, thus leaving the MRSA infection free to proliferate in the intracellular compartment. The Purdue technology addresses this shortcoming of existing therapeutics while also addressing the need for a therapy that will not encourage bacterial resistance. Multiple strains of MRSA did not display any resistance characteristics when treated with these therapeutic molecules over time. Preliminary data indicate that these compounds exhibit decreased MRSA load in mice to the same degree as vancomycin. Additionally, these molecules underwent an Ames test and displayed no mutagenic characteristics. When screened at 10x MIC, they showed no toxicity to red blood cells in in vitro experiments. Initial mechanistic studies show these molecules reduce levels of bacterial DNA, RNA, and cell wall biosynthesis with similar or better potencies relative to antibiotics commonly used to reduce these macromolecules.Advantages:  -No adverse effects to host cells-No acquired bacterial resistancePotential applications:-Antimicrobial resistance-Antibiotic therapy-MRSA therapeuticRelated Publication:Inhibitors of Intracellular Gram-Positive Bacterial Growth Synthesized via Povarov–Doebner ReactionsACS Infect. Dis. 2019, 5, 11, 1820-1830DOI: 10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00022"
Treating Glioblastoma with Multi-Functional Natural Killer Cells and Small Molecule Autophagy Inhibitor,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed an immunotherapy approach combining cell therapy and a small molecule inhibitor to treat glioblastoma. This devastating cancer is characterized by the heterogeneity of tumor antigens expressed on the surface of the tumor cells. This heterogeneity makes glioblastoma difficult to treat using mono-immunotherapeutic approaches, a treatment option that typically results in resistance to the therapy. Therefore there is a critical need to develop approaches to treat glioblastoma to overcome the heterogeneity of the disease. The technology developed consists of genetically-engineered natural killer (NK) cells and a small molecule inhibitor. The NK cells target two glioblastoma antigens while also blocking adenosine mediated immunosuppression to increase immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. Along with the cell therapy small molecule based autophagy inhibition promotes intra-tumoral NK cell infiltration, further increasing the effectiveness of the therapy. The genetic construct has been successfully expressed in NK cells as seen by flow cytometry analysis.  NK cells engineered with the construct display significant increases in the killing of a patient-derived glioblastoma cell line when compared to wild-type NK cells. This technology provides the first combination immunotherapy approach toward glioblastoma treatment providing the potential to drastically increase patient survival.Advantages:-Multi-Faceted Glioblastoma Treatment Option-Increases Immune Cell InfiltrationPotential applications:-Glioblastoma Therapy-Combination Therapy"
Biomimetic Platform to Characterize Tissue Swelling,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a biomimetic platform to quantify injection-induced tissue swelling. Administering biologics by subcutaneous injection is faster than by intravenous infusion and convenient for patients who can self-administer at home. However, the practice has not been broadly adopted, in part due to pain and discomfort from tissue swelling that occurs during an injection. There is currently no reliable platform to quantify tissue swelling for optimizing drug formulations. The Purdue researchers' platform enables prediction of mechanical stress and interstitial fluid pressure to optimize drug formulations with the goal of reducing pain and discomfort during subcutaneous injection."
Wireless Sensor Network for Enhanced Process Monitoring and Control of Lyophilization,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a sensor network that monitors chamber pressure and temperature and estimates the sublimation rate of a solvent during lyophilization. The technology enables optimizing drying in real time, and unlike other methods it is non-invasive, as it does not require temperature probes to be placed into the material. The sensor network is wireless and therefore can be integrated deep into the shelf. Applications for the technology include in lyophilization of drugs and foods.Advantages:-Real time tunability of drying-Non-invasive-WirelessPotential Applications:-Lyophilization"
"Novel Low pH, Low sugar Gel-forming Soluble Polysaccharide for Bioactive Materials","Researchers at Purdue University have developed a low pH, low sugar gel from arabinoxylan complexes in corn. It is non-toxic, biocompatible, and increases satiety upon consumption. This novel soluble gel is combined in a beverage for heightened post-meal energy and encapsulation and slow distribution of bioactives. These properties make these gels well suited for food, biomedical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic applications.Advantages:-Low pH-Increased post-meal energy-Controlled release of bioactivePotential Applications:-Food and beverages-Nutraceuticals for drug delivery-Cosmetics"
Potent and Non-toxic Molecules for Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed potent synthetic small molecules with high potential as drugs against castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that are non-toxic in normal human cell lines. To address the heterogeneity of cellular pathways in cancer, the source of a cancer's ability to become resistant to therapy, the investigators designed these molecules using a machine learning approach that targets the protein network implicated in the disease state to guide compound selection and synthesis. The series of compounds developed inhibits proliferation of C4-2 androgen-insensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cells with IC50 as low as 0.72 nM, and the compounds are much more potent than a control, the current steroidal CRPC drug, abiraterone (ABI). The most potent compound and other active leads were also more metabolically stable than ABI in a mouse liver microsome assay. Further, these compounds promise to combat metastasis; they slow migration of cells relative to untreated cells in both LNCaP and C4-2 cell lines. Advantages: -Non-toxic-Potent-Addresses drug resistancePotential Applications: -Disease Research-Cancer Therapy"
Engineering NK Cells to Treat Cancers Driven by Adenosine Immunosuppression,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a cell therapy capable of exerting a cytotoxic effect on CD73 expressing cancer cells. Adenosine immunosuppression is a regulatory mechanism of the immune system that protects against autoimmunity. However, this mechanism also drives cancers that express the enzyme, CD73. This enzyme produces adenosine, a molecule that inhibits immune cells. The Purdue technology circumvents this adenosine-mediated immunosuppression to treat cancer.Purdue's researchers engineered a type of immune cell, the natural killer (NK) cell, to target and kill cancer cells. The cells are engineered to express a protein consisting of an extracellular CD73 antibody fragment for targeting and an intracellular signaling domain that activates the NK cell to destroy the cancer cell. This potential therapy circumvents adenosine immunosuppression in the solid tumor microenvironment, selectively targeting cancer cells with engineered immune cells. The engineered NK cells have been successfully tested against glioblastoma cell lines and in vivo in lung carcinoma models, supporting this technology as a transformative cancer treatment to effectively target solid tumors. Advantages-Selective cancer therapeutic-NK cell mediated cytotoxicityPotential Applications-Cancer therapeutic-Circumvent adenosine immunosuppression"
Microwave Assisted Freeze Drying,"Primary drying is the most critical and time-consuming step in the lyophilization process used widely in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. To achieve minimal product loss, common practice is to optimize the recipe (time, temperature, and pressure) in each step of the lyophilization process, which wastes time unnecessarily. Purdue researchers have developed a technology that uses microwave assisted heating in place of conventional heating. It allows for precise heating control of the frozen substance, including the ability to apply heat energy to specific locations inside the lyophilization chamber. Advantages: -Precise tuning of heating properties-Selective heating of specific locations-Faster processing timePotential Applications: -Pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry-Food industry"
Highly Potent HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors,"There is a need to develop new treatments for patients living with HIV-1, as HIV-1 rapidly acquires resistance to treatment options. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Compared to darunavir, a leading FDA approved drug, these compounds were 100 times more potent in cell culture. Additionally, the compounds have improved metabolic stability over previous protease inhibitors. The primary application for these compounds is for the treatment of multidrug-resistant HIV-1. Advantages: -Improved potency against HIV-1-Improved pharmacokinetic propertiesPotential Applications: -HIV/AIDS treatment"
Non-Opioid for Treating Chronic Pain and Opioid Dependence,"The annual cost of chronic pain in the United States is estimated to be $635 million, impacting more than 100 million people, as reported by the American Pain Society. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 91 people die in the U.S. every day from an opioid overdose. Chronic and inflammatory pain are commonly treated with opioids. However, use of opioids often leads to opioid dependence. Dependence puts patients at risk for overdose, both fatal and nonfatal. As the World Health Organization states, 45% of drug users experience nonfatal overdose.Researchers at Purdue University are developing compounds to provide effective pain relief without the risks associated with opioids. The researchers' compounds selectively inhibit adenylyl cyclase 1, an enzyme that has previously been validated as a target for inflammatory pain. Inhibiting adenylyl cyclase 1 produces an analgesic effect in animal models. These compounds also show promise as a therapy to treat opioid dependence, itself.Advantages: -Chronic and inflammatory pain relief -Non-opioid -Non-addictive Potential Applications: -Pain treatment -Opioid dependence treatment optionRelated Publication:Tarsis F. Brust et al., Identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of type 1 adenylyl cyclase activity with analgesic propertiesSci Signal. 2017 Feb 21;10(467)."

Selective Antibiotics for Highly Resistant Enterococcus,"Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections in the US. There is an unmet need for new treatments of VRE, as infected patients frequently exhaust treatment options when fighting bacterial resistance.Researchers at Purdue University have developed small molecules to combat drug-resistant enterococcus. These acetazolamide analogs demonstrated a 2 to 4-log reduction in VRE gastrointestinal colonization in mice and were superior to linezolid, the current standard of care, in clearing VRE in internal organs. Additionally, they were shown to selectively target VRE without harming the normal gut microbiota. The application for these compounds is for the treatment of drug-resistant enterococcus.Advantages: -Improved potency against VRE-High selectivity for VRE Potential Applications: -VRE treatment"
Liposomal Carriers with High Drug Loading Capacity,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for encapsulating drugs in liposomes with higher efficiency than competing methods. Liposomal encapsulation of chemotherapeutic agents is widely used to reduce nonspecific side effects, because liposomes will preferentially target the tumor's leaky vasculature. Liposomes are typically loaded with drugs using pH gradients. However, some drugs, such as gemcitabine, a first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer, have proven difficult to load into liposomes with reasonable efficiency. In a proof-of-concept study using this new method, gemcitabine had a loading efficiency of 9.4 - 10.3 wt% compared to 0.14 - 3.8 wt% by conventional methods. Applications for this technology include in the development of novel drug formulations for the treatment of cancer.Advantages: -Higher drug loading efficiency-Good stability and sustained release of drugPotential Applications: -Pharmaceutical formulations"
Selective Fluorescent Probe for the Immunoproteasome,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a fluorescent probe, TBZ, which selectively targets the core particle of the immunoproteasome (iCP) and can be used to monitor its expression in live cells. In an important cellular process that occurs within human and animal cells, proteins are degraded by the proteasome. As part of the molecular machinery of immune cells that have encountered inflammatory signals, a type of proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is a target of interest for autoimmune disease and cancer drug development. Current probes are not selective for iCP; they do not distinguish between this and other forms of the proteasome core particle. This new probe that fluoresces upon cleavage by iCP is efficient, selective, and can be used in live cells. Within 15 minutes of incubating the cell with 31 micromolar TBZ, iCP was detected in Ramos, SK-MEL-2, and A549 cell lines. At 31 micromolar, TBZ retains 3:1 selectivity for iCP versus the standard core particle.Advantages: -Selective towards iCP-Can be used in live cells-Higher fluorescence signal than commercial probePotential Applications: -Intracellular iCP pathway monitoring-Investigative protein expressionTags: Chemistry and Chemical Analysis, Pharmaceuticals, Fluorescent Dyes, Reagents, Research Tools, Proteasome, Immune, Drug Discovery"
Low Cost Synthesis of Lomustine Under Continuous Flow Conditions,"Lomustine is a commercially available drug used to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma and brain tumors. According to Wall Street Journal, the price has increased over 1400 percent over the past 5 years which has made it unaffordable to many patients. The company currently selling Lomustine stated that one reason for the price hike is growing operational costs associated with the drug. Since lomustine has no generic competitors, there is a need for lower production cost of lomustine to make this treatment economical for patients.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a continuous manufacturing process for lomustine that has a short residence time and 63 percent yield. Major advantages of this process are that the total production cost for lomustine is lower, the product is higher quality, and the manufacturing operation is safer for production personnel.Advantages: -Control of purity-Continuous manufacturingPotential Applications: -Pharmaceutical manufacturing"
 New Target Identified for Cancer Therapy and Its Inhibitor,"A major challenge in developing efficacious cancer therapies is the identification of target protein. Once a target is identified drugs can be developed and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the target. Recently through a collaboration with Scripps Research Institute and Purdue University, DNA polymerase epsilon subunit 3 (POLE3) has been identified as a target for cancer therapeutics. POLE3 combines with other enzymes to form a complex involved in DNA replication which occurs more frequently in cancerous cells than normal cells.Researchers at Purdue University have developed the first reported inhibitors of POLE3. The group of compounds that have been identified as POLE3 inhibitors are synthetic derivatives of beshanzuenone, a natural molecule from the Chinese fir tree. Beshanzuenone was previously reported to have activity against PTP1B, a target for diabetes II and obesity. In addition to the POLE3 inhibitors, new synthetic derivatives of beshanzuenone were also identified to have potent activity against SHP2 via a novel mode of action. SHP2 is a validated oncogenic target for a variety of human cancers. Total Synthesis, Biological Evaluation, and Target Identification of Rare Abies SesquiterpenoidsJ. Am. Chem.

Novel Inhalation Formulation of Antimicrobials,"Antimicrobial therapy via the inhalation route has attracted increasing momentum for the treatment of lower respiratory systems. Inhalation therapy improves drug concentration on airway surfaces with reduced systemic exposure. Typically, the inhaled drug particles produced by the traditional jet-milling approach are highly cohesive and have poor flowability and aerosolization performance. Addition of excipients, such as lactose particles, may improve the aerosolization of cohesive powders; however, for high-dose drugs, like antibiotics, the addition of excipients may increase the inhalation powder mass that needs an excessive number of inhalations to complete the dose and a bulky inhaler to accommodate the large dose.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel inhalation formulation which shows superior antibacterial activity. Incorporation of this formulation is evidenced by an almost two-fold increase in aerosol delivery efficiency expressed as fine particle fraction. The synergistic antimicrobial activities and the increased aerosolization performance from this formulation will not only improve patient compliance by reducing the inhaled powder mass and minimizing local adverse effects, but will also have the potential to achieve superior therapeutic efficacy.Advantages: -Enhanced antimicrobial activity-Reduces inhaled powder mass-Minimizes local adverse effectsPotential Applications: -Dry powder inhalers-Respiratory infections-Antimicrobial therapy via inhalation"
Enantiopure Synthesis of Alpha-Aminoboronic Acid Derivatives,"Alpha-aminoboronic acids have been shown to possess anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, and anti-viral activity. This has resulted in increasing interest in developing alpha-aminoboronic acid derivatives for pharmaceutical application. However, this is difficult due to the nature of the chemical synthesis pathway. It is often desired to produce a specific enantiomer of alpha-aminoboronic acid because the activity of the molecule can differ between enantiomers. Unfortunately, there are limited number of synthesis pathways to produce enantiospecific derivatives.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a synthesis pathway to produce enantiopure N-substituted quaternary alpha-aminoboronic esters. This borylation pathway can be used for molecules with multiple chiral centers. Experiments showed that alpha-aminoboronic acid derivatives were able to be produced with 82 to 99 percent yield and over 99 percent enatiopurity.Advantages: -Enantiopure synthesis-High YieldPotential Applications: -Synthesis of alpha-aminoboronic acid derivatives-Borylation of molecules-Drug development"
"Anti-Angiogenesis Compound Targets Laminin Receptor in Cancer Cells
","Laminin receptor (37/67 LR) is a membrane protein when over-expressed can promote metastasis of cancer cells. This is due to the ability of 37/67 LR to promote blood vessel formation in tumors in a process called angiogenesis. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is an endogenous protein that can bind to 37/67 LR to inhibit angiogenesis. PEDF is a viable therapy for cancer patients but due to it being an endogenous protein there are enzymes present in the body that degrade it. As well as, peptide formulation for drug delivery is difficult due to protein stability. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a small molecule that elicits a similar response as PEDF when it binds to 37/67 LR. Upon binding to 37/67 LR, the hit compound, C3, modulated an anti-angiogenesis pathway that inhibited prostate cancer cell viability, proliferation, and migration. Due to C3 being a small molecule, it did not bind to PEDF proteolytic enzymes, thus, bypassing PEDF degradation process which could result in longer duration of action. C3 is a promising hit compound which has potential for future development as a lead compound for prostate cancer treatment.Advantages: -Anti-tumor-Anti-angiogenesis-Bypass proteolytic degradationPotential Applications: -Prostate cancer therapy-ChemotherapyRelated Publication: Charles Samuel Umbaugh Et al., A dock derived compound against laminin receptor (37 LR) exhibits anti-cancer properties in a prostate cancer cell line modelOncotarget, 2018, Vol. 9, (No. 5), pp: 5958-5978"
Next Generation Probiotic that Improves Gut Health and Provides Protection against Enteric Pathogens,"Listeria monocytogenes is an opportunistic human foodborne pathogen responsible for severe systemic infection (listeriosis) which can lead to stillborn and premature births, as well as mortality in newborns, the elderly, and other immunocompromised individuals. Listeria monocytogenes is well adapted to survive in the harsh environment of the gut. Currently, there is no probiotic based protection against the Listeria monoctyogenes infection available.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a next generation probiotic bacteria that binds to intestinal epithelial cells with high affinity to the receptor protein Hsp60 on the intestinal surface. This reduces inflammatory response and prevents Listeria monocytogenes from entering the intestinal epithelial cell barrier. This probiotic bacterium improves gut epithelial barrier integrity and helps protect against disease. The number of pathogens that crossed intestinal cells is reduced significantly.  In mouse studies, 90% of mice were protected from the disease.Advantages: -Protects against L. monocytogenes-Improves gut epithelial barrier integrityPotential Applications: -L. monocytogenes protection-Chronic inflammatory conditions"
Inhibitors for Protein alpha-N-terminal Methyltransferases,"Protein N-terminal methyltransferase 1 (NTMT1) plays an important role in regulating cell mitosis, chromatin interactions, and DNA repair. NTMT1 is over-expressed in cancer patient tissues including the head and neck, colorectal, malignant melanoma, compared to normal tissue. Knockdown of NTMT1 promotes hypersensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) by etoposide and gamma irradiation. This knowledge has made NTMT1 an important anticancer target. Currently, there are no specific cell-potent probes available for NTMT1. There is a need for a new technology that can target the NTMT1 protein.Researchers at Purdue University have developed new potent inhibitors for the protein NTMT. The inhibitor exhibited high selectivity to NTMT1/2 over a panel of 41 methyltransferases. These chemical compounds are novel because they are amenable for cell-based studies. They may be further optimized for animal studies. This technology is more stable and cell-permeable than existing solutions. This technology could open the door for elucidate the pharmacological functions of protein NTMT1.Advantages: -Amenable for cell based studies-Displays selective inhibition for NTMT1-May be used for animal studiesPotential Applications: -Cell based studies-Animal studies"
Reporter Molecule for 20S Proteasome Stimulators for Parkinson's and Aging,"Accumulation of excess protein is linked to aging, Parkinson's disease, and other human diseases. The large enzyme complex known as the proteasome, specifically its subunit the 20S core particle (20S CP), can degrade proteins to then be recycled to make new proteins. Scientists hypothesize that chemically stimulating the 20S CP can degrade the disease-related proteins and serve as a treatment for protein accumulation disorders. The reporter molecule currently available to assay new compounds for 20S CP-stimulating activity produces a high level of background signal in the absence of any stimulators, making discovery of new 20S CP stimulators via high-throughput screening a challenge.Researchers at Purdue University have designed a new reporter molecule to detect stimulation of the 20S CP that is 3.5 times as sensitive as the current reporter. The sensitivity and effectiveness of this new FRET-based reporter was validated by screening 715 compounds for 20S CP stimulating activity. Four 20S CP stimulators were found in the screen, two of which were missed in a screen using the established reporter molecule. Related Publications:Rachel A. Coleman and Darci J. Trader, Developement and Application of a Sensitive Peptide Reporter to DIscover 20S Proteasome StimulatorsACS Comb.

Logical Operations in Mass Spectrometry,"The information in tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a three-dimensional data domain which, as of right now, can only be accessed by zero or 1-dimensional experiments that explore a 2-dimensional data domain. These traditional MS/MS scans might require the sampling of multiple ion populations to answer structural questions. A method that could explore a 3-dimensional data domain following a single ion injection event would provide more options to explore the data space.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new methodology for operating a mass spectrometer that provides efficient routes from the large block of MS/MS data to answer particular structural questions. It is a major conceptual extension of MS/MS that allows experiments which explore the 3-dimensional data domain of MS/MS. Only data space relevant to the question is explored, minimizing time and ion utilization. This methodology is particularly valuable for ion traps and miniature in situ mass spectrometers, but the concepts could readily be extended to other types of mass spectrometers including triple quadrupoles.Advantages: -Extends power of MS/MS experiments-Provides more options to explore data space-Minimizes time and ion utilizationPotential Applications: -Miniature instruments-Ion traps-Multi-analyzer instruments"
Implantable Single-Use Drug Delivery Device for Opioid Overdose,"According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, over 569,000 people died from drug overdose between 1999 and 2015, of which over 216,000 people died from prescription opioid overdose. An FDA approved anti-overdose drug, naloxone, counteracts the action of opioids. Although naloxone's availability has improved in recent years with legislation allowing for over-the-counter purchase of the drug, patients often are incapacitated and unable to administer the potential life-saving drug on themselves in a timely manner. There is a need for a single-use anti-overdose drug delivery method that allows drug users to administer an antidote to combat the effects of an overdose. Researchers from Purdue University have developed an implantable drug delivery device that injects a single dose of naloxone or another anti-opioid overdose drug. The device will inject under the skin of at-risk patients of opioid misuse and activate upon detection of an overdose event. When an overdose occurs, the body reacts with a sudden increase in temperatures and other abrupt changes to normal body function. Such sudden changes trigger the implanted device, allowing the anti-opioid overdose drug to diffuse the overdose before lethal effects occur. The device will facilitate delivery of the antidote for caretakers or emergency responders. In future iterations, incorporating feedback control allows for the automatic release of the antidote upon overdose detection. Advantages:-Facilitates delivery of antidote-Eliminates overdose-Wireless-ImplantablePotential Applications:-People at risk for drug overdose-Drug delivery-Implantable devices"
Therapeutics for Triple Negative Breast Cancer,"More than 200,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States.  The most aggressive type of breast cancer, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), disproportionately affects young premenopausal women of African-American or Hispanic descent. Chemotherapy remains the only treatment for TNBC; however, chemotherapy does not specifically target cancer cells, causing debilitating side effects. A new, targeted therapy is needed to treat TNBC without adverse effects. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that could change how breast cancer is treated. The researchers have developed new drug candidates that are potent at lower concentrations than chemotherapy. The technology employs molecules that are selectively taken up by cancer cells and activated by light. In vitro, this therapeutic drug is photoactive at the nanomolar range with an appropriate light dose adjustment and has no observable toxicity when not exposed to light. This targeted therapy promises to reduce the dosage of drug needed to treat TNBC and effectively reduce side effects. Advantages: -Reduced adverse effects-Targeted therapy -Potent at low concentrations Potential Applications: -Breast cancer -Cancer therapeuticsRelated Publication:Photodynamic Activity of Vitamin-Chlorin Conjugates at Nanomolar Concentrations against Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsACS Omega 2019, 4, 2, 2907-2920DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.8b02323"
Accelerated Degradation of Pharmaceuticals and Related Chemical Processes,"Forced degradation is an accelerated method of studying the stability of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in order to predict the shelf life of the drug. Forced degradation studies of APIs are an important aspect of pharmaceutical development. Typical forced degradation methods take one to seven days to complete and are then followed with product analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). These methods are time consuming and costly. There is a need for a more efficient method of forced degradation.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new forced degradation method.  Using Leidenfrost droplets to accelerate forced degradation and nanospray mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize the reaction products, the reaction/analysis sequence provided results within minutes, i.e., five minutes, versus taking up to a week to complete. The FDA requires forced degradation for licensing, which causes a bottleneck in pharmaceutical production. An accelerated forced degradation method could help eliminate this bottleneck.Advantages: -Faster-More efficient-Reliable-Potential to speed up FDA licensing processPotential Applications: -Pharmaceutical industry-Drug development"
Enhanced Drug Delivery Across Epithelial Barrier,"One of the most common practices of drug delivery is by the oral route. However, overcoming the gastrointestinal epithelial barriers is the major challenge for efficient delivery of drugs. Besides the intracellular route or passive diffusion, the paracellular route can be exploited by using a bacterial peptide for enhanced delivery of drugs through the epithelial barrier to reach the underlying lamina propria and submucosal compartment. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an approach for enhanced delivery of drugs through the intestinal epithelial barrier to reach the underlying propria and submucosal compartment. The use of the Listeria adhesion protein (LAP) enhances permeability through the intestinal barrier. This technology would be suitable for enhanced delivery of a variety of drugs across the mucosal epithelial barrier.Advantages: -Enhanced permeability-Improved efficiencyPotential Applications: -Drug delivery-Pharmaceutical companies"
Multidrug-Resistant HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors,"According to the Centers for Disease Control, an estimated 1.2 million people in the United States live with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 1 in 7 are unaware that they have it. HIV is a virus that weakens the immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. There is currently no cure for HIV, but it can be controlled. If HIV is not treated, the virus can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS usually occurs in the last stage of HIV when the development of cancer and other diseases take advantage of the weakened immune system. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the most effective treatment for HIV. Unfortunately, drug side effects and the emergence of drug resistance have reduced the effectiveness of ART.Researchers at Purdue University have developed new compounds that have been shown to maintain potency against multidrug-resistant HIV variants. These compounds are novel protease inhibitors, but unlike current protease inhibitor drugs, these compounds bind to the protease backbone very tightly, exhibiting improved drug resistance. Many inhibitors in the current series have shown exceedingly potent enzyme inhibitory and antiviral potency. This class of inhibitors may exhibit much improved pharmacological properties compared to darunavir and other FDA approved inhibitors. Advantages: -Increased antiviral potency-Potent enzyme inhibitor-Improved pharmacological properties-Maintains potency against multidrug-resistant HIV variantsPotential Applications: -Pharmaceuticals-Treatment option for HIV/AIDS and specifically for multidrug-resistant HIV variants -Medical/Health"
EGF-Targeted Bladder Cancer Therapeutic,"The American Cancer Society (ACS) annually issues estimates for new cancer diagnoses and cancer deaths. For 2016, ACS estimates for bladder cancer is 76,960 new diagnoses and 16,390 deaths. Bladder cancer is the fourth and eleventh most common cancer in men and women respectively. The average age at diagnosis is 73 and 90 percent of patients are over the age 55. It is estimated that the annual national cost of bladder cancer care will reach $5.25 billion in 2020. Approximately 70 percent of newly diagnosed patients suffer disease recurrence after surgical treatment and more than 20 percent develop invasive bladder cancer. There is a need to develop efficient therapeutic strategies against this pathology.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a therapeutic strategy using a modified bacterial toxin to target the EGF receptor and destroy bladder cancer cells. This agent proved to be superior due to its specificity and high efficacy at eliminating cancer cells, taking only minutes for treatment with enhanced safety. In animal studies, there were no toxic side effects and it was very effective against treatment-resistant tumors in dogs.  Advantages:-Non-surgical treatment option-Treatment takes minutes vs. hours-Promising results in animal studiesPotential Applications:-Bladder cancer treatment"
Simultaneous Treatment of Alcohol Use and Psychiatric Disorders,"Alcohol use disorder is a chronic relapsing condition that includes alcohol withdrawal syndrome and is frequently comorbid with chronic pain disorders and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. There are only a few drugs approved to treat alcohol use disorder. Their only goal is to reduce alcohol cravings. They do not treat psychiatric disorders. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology for treating alcohol use disorder. In addition to targeting reduced alcohol intake, it simultaneously treats depression. This new treatment is meant to help patients suffering from both alcohol use and psychiatric disorders. This treatment should exhibit much fewer side effects and improved efficacy when compared to currently available treatments. Advantages:-Simultaneously treats alcohol use and psychiatric disorders-Exhibits fewer side effects -Improved efficacyPotential Applications: -Patients suffering from both alcohol use and psychiatric disorders-Alcohol treatment centers-Hospitals"
Second Generation Phenylthiazole Antibiotics for Treatment of MRSA,"The most common 'superbug' found in hospitals is Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA). In the 1940s, 95 percent of staphylococcus aureus could be controlled by penicillin, but that is now down to 10 percent (DailyMail.com). The CDC estimates that there are over 80,000 invasive MRSA infections annually, resulting in over 11,000 deaths. Even with the continuous development of new antibiotics to use against MRSA, bacterial resistance continues to grow. Phenylthiazoles have been examined as a new class of antibiotics, but its potential is hampered by poor pharmacokinetic profiles.Researchers at Purdue University have developed second generation Phenylthiazole antibiotics with enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. After synthesis, tuning, and proper treatment of the substances, one of the compounds showed significant improvement in in-vitro anti-MRSA potency. The rapid elimination of bacterial cells was achieved. This series has improved pharmacokinetic properties compared to the first generation with a better safety profile.Advantages:-Improved pharmacokinetic properties-Rapid elimination of bacterial cells-Significant improvement in in-vitro anti-MRSA potencyPotential Applications:-MRSA treatment-Treatment of other 'superbugs'-Antibiotic development"
Improved Nanoparticle Based Targeted Drug Delivery to Cancerous Cells and Tissues,"Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth. Currently there are more than 100 types of identified cancer that affect human beings as well as animals. In 2016, there were an estimated 1,685,210 new human cancer cases diagnosed and 595,690 cancer deaths in the United States alone (Cancer Statistics 2016 - American Cancer Society, Inc.). Nanoparticles (NPs) have been considered a promising carrier of chemotherapeutic drugs, but are limited in delivery to tumors due to the diverse nature of the disease. There currently exists the need to leverage the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deliver NPs beyond the current levels possible.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for preparing polyol-modified nanoparticles for targeted delivery to cancerous cells and tissues via transcytosis across the peritumoral endothelium. This method does not depend on the leakiness of the vasculature like traditional nanoparticle formulations, but actively interacts with the vascular lining to enter tumors.Advantages:-Increases the amount of drugs deliver to solid tumors-Reduces the required dose and related side effects-Does not depend on long-term circulation and passive extravasationPotential Applications:-Cancer treatment-Drug deliveryRelated Publication:Quinic Acid-Conjugated Nanoparticles Enhance Drug Delivery to Solid Tumors via Interactions with Endothelial SelectinsSmall 14 (50), 1803601DOI: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.201803601"
Improved Drug Delivery Using Tough Hydrogel that Acts as a Synthetic Skin ,"For many years, the achievement of continuous release of medication has been the focus of controlled drug release research. An on-demand control of drug delivery is desired in many clinical situations, as it promises to improve therapeutic efficacy and lessen side effects. Hydrogels are an ideal candidates given they respond to changes in the environment including pH, temperature, light, electric fields, and magnetic fields. Unfortunately, such triggers to do not transfer to clinical environments well. There is a need for improved methods of delivering pharmaceutical drugs to patients.Purdue University researchers have developed the use of tough multiple-network hydrogels for the reliable delivery of water-soluble drugs dissolve in this medium.  The dissolved drugs are released from the hydrogel in a controlled fashion, suppressing the initial burst release of drugs and providing a reliable mechanism to controllably release drugs into a local area.  Some of the hydrogels utilized have similar mechanical properties to skin.  This provides greater comfort for a patient and allows for utilization in difficult applications areas like joints, e.g., knees, elbows.Advantages:-Compatible with water-soluble drugs-Controlled delivery of drugs-Suppresses initial burse release of drugs-Allows for stretching to large deformations-Mechanically similar to skinPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical companies-Drug delivery-On-skin applications"
Selective Ubiquitin Specific Protease Inhibitors for Treatment of Multiple Myeloma and Other Cancers,"Multiple myeloma is a cancer formed by malignant plasma cells. Normal plasma cells found in bone marrow are an important part of the immune system (American Cancer Society). In 2017, the American Cancer Society estimates approximately 30,280 new multiple myeloma cases diagnosed in the United States with approximately 12,590 deaths expected. Current methods of treatment include immunomodulatory drugs, stem cell transplants, and proteasesome inhibitors. However, multiple myeloma remains incurable. Current treatment methods have issues with side effects and the potential for the development of resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of novel therapeutic agents.Researchers at Purdue University have uncovered a new set of molecules that selectively inhibit ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7) without affecting similar enzymes. Inhibition of USP7 is important for the treatment of multiple myeloma, as well as for other diseases characterized by aberrant ubiquitin-mediated processes, such as many cancer, inflammation, and immunological disorders. The molecules identified by Purdue researchers have broad potential for the development of therapeutics to treat cancer and other diseases.Advantages:-Selective inhibition-Targets key enzymesPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industry-Drug development-Treatment for cancer and other diseases"
Adenoviral Vector-Based Influenza Vaccine,"In the past, avian influenza H5N1, H7N7, and H9N2 viruses have infected humans, highlighting the ability of some avian subtypes to cross the species barrier. Such events can cause pandemic outbreaks of influenza by the emergence of an avian-human reassortant virus with the ability to spread rapidly in the human population.  Our current therapies have not been effective in abolishing the spread of these diseases. Pandemic influenza viruses, such as H5N1, are less immunogenic compared to epidemic influenza viruses, such as H1N1, and therefore, subunit or inactivated whole virus vaccines for H5N1 do not provide effective protection.  Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel strategy for combating influenza by using an adenoviral vector-based vaccine delivery system. Adenoviral vectors are known to activate innate immunity and can be administered via the mucosal or parenteral route, resulting in a strong immune rejection response. This novel method has been shown to provide effective protection against a lethal challenge with a pathogenic influenza virus. These vaccine strategies can be easily adapted to either pandemic or epidemic influenza viruses and provide effective protection to the population. Advantages:-Provides an effective vaccine for pandemic or epidemic influenza-Easily mass-produce large quantities of vaccine in a timely mannerPotential Applications:-Vaccines"
Novel Immunocompetent Breast Cancer Mouse Model,"Various monoclonal antibody-based treatments for breast cancer exist at different stages of development. Present technologies utilize the nude mouse model of breast cancer, which is not a true reflection of what may occur in normal animals in response to such treatments. Purdue University researchers found the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 is over-expressed in breast cancer cells, and therefore, provides a unique target for breast cancer intervention. An immunocompetent mouse model of breast cancer has been developed for evaluating various therapeutic approaches including those involving activation or inhibition of EphA2.Advantages:-Improved mouse model of breast cancerPotential Applications:-Drug development-Therapy evaluation"
Novel Conformationally Constrained Memapsin 2 Inhibitors for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"The processing of a precursor protein by memapsin 2 (beta-secretase, BACE 1) is the first step in the pathway leading to the production of Alzheimer's disease-causing amyloid-beta; thus, it is a major target for the development of inhibitor drugs used in the treatment of this disease.  A Purdue University researcher has designed a series of novel memapsin 2 inhibitors that incorporate conformationally constrained cyclic amine derivatives in place of conventional hydroxyethylamine isostere-derived inhibitors.  These inhibitors' design improves pharmacological properties of drug forms, improving metabolic stability, oral bioavailability, and in vivo A-reductions. 	Advantages:-Improved pharmacological propertiesPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical industry"
Potent HIV Protease Inhibitor Against HIV/AIDS,"HIV-1 protease inhibitors are the key component of current antiretroviral treatment (ART) of HIV infection and AIDS. The majority of today's FDA approved protease inhibitors do not show efficacy because of the emergence of drug resistance. Darunavir, a leading protease inhibitor drug, is widely used for the treatment of patients harboring drug-resistant HIV variants. However, after long-term use, darunavir-resistant HIV-1 variants are emerging and there are very limited options to treat these patients.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new class of inhibitors that have shown exceptional potency against multidrug resistant (MDR) HIV-1 variants. The developed compounds are novel and show better drug-resistant properties.Advantages:-Fight drug-resistant HIV-1 variants-New compounds show better drug-resistant propertiesPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industry-HIV/AIDS treatment"
Top1/TDP1/TDP2 Triple Inhibitor Anticancer Agents,"In 2016, the American Cancer Society estimated 1,685,210 new cancer cases diagnosed and 595,690 cancer deaths in the U.S.  There is a great need for the development of new therapies for cancer treatment.  Currently, topoisomerase 1 (Top1) inhibitors are used as anticancer agents.  DNA damage caused by topoisomerase 1 inhibitors needs to be repaired in order to prevent the death of tumor cells.  Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 and 2 (TDP1 and TDP2) can repair damaged DNA resulting from Top1 inhibitors and a variety of other DNA-damaging agents.  Triple inhibitors of Top1, TDP1, and TDP2 are therefore able to damage the DNA of cancer cells and also prevent its repair, thereby causing cancer cell death.Purdue University researchers have developed a series of azaindenoisoquinoline compounds that act as inhibitors of Top1, TDP1, and TDP2.  Molecular modeling of selected target compounds bound to Top1, TDP1, and TDP2 was used to design the inhibitors and facilitate the structure-activity relationship analysis. The resulting compounds act as triple inhibitors of Top1, TDP1, and TDP2, which increases anticancer activity.Advantages:-Triple inhibitors-Increases anticancer activityPotential Applications:-Cancer treatment-Radiation-Antiviral therapies"
Completely Continuous Plug Flow Crystallization Process of Pharmaceutical Production,"Using a traditional plug flow crystallization method for the manufacture of an active pharmaceutical ingredient creates encrustation in the system, causing inefficient production. This encrustation blocks flow through the reactor resulting in an inconsistent product and necessitating frequent cleaning. Most importantly, the resulting pharmaceutical product will have inferior properties, resulting in inconsistent dosage in the patient. However, a perfected method of plug flow crystallization has the potential to increase manufacturing productivity and product quality. Researchers from Purdue University have developed a reactor system that eliminates encrustation in plug flow crystallization platforms used in pharmaceutical manufacturing. This system eliminates down time for reactor cleaning, increases product yield, and yields a more consistent product. The more consistent active pharmaceutical ingredients produced using this plug flow system will ultimately provide an optimum dose for the patient's best means of recovery. Advantages: -Efficient manufacturing -Higher production yield  -Allows for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing Potential Applications: -Drug manufacturing"
Synthetic Lung Surfactant for Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) causes nearly 40 percent of premature infant deaths worldwide. A lack of natural surfactant in their under-developed lungs is the initial cause of RDS. Treatment is not readily available for RDS in developing countries because conventional surfactant replacement therapy uses animal-derived surfactants that are costly to produce, must be carefully stored, and require highly trained practitioners to perform a sophisticated delivery procedure.Researchers from Purdue University have developed a synthetic polymer-based surfactant to treat RDS by supplementing the premature infant's naturally produced surfactants. The synthetic lung surfactant, proven effective by in vitro measurements using a lung-mimetic device, will be less expensive to produce and store and will not require delivery by skilled physicians. This simple, cost effective surfactant is a promising treatment to decrease the mortality rate of premature infants worldwide.Advantages: -Less costly to produce and store-Less variation in production versus current animal-derived surfactant-Treatment option for developing countries Potential Applications: -Respiratory distress syndrome"
Simulating the Powder Properties of a 3D Roll Compactor,"Powder roll compaction is a processing technique used in many industries to compress a fine powder into larger granules. The larger particles are generally easier to process than the fine powder, but their density and size must be consistent. Researchers at Purdue University have developed models for Abaqus, a software suite for finite element analysis and computer-aided engineering, which simulate the powder properties of a 3D roll compactor. The models predict the roll force, roll torque, and roller-compacted ribbon density distribution. Better simulations allow for control over the uniform density of the granulated powder.Advantages:-Increases uniform density of granulated powder-Predicts the roll force, torque, and compacted ribbon density distributionPotential Applications:-Drug production-Food processing"
Cellular Model of Parkinson's Disease,"Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is central in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Converging evidence suggests that the level of aSyn expression plays a critical role in both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease. The study of aSyn toxicity remains critical because the manner in which aberrant aSyn leads to neuronal degeneration is not yet understood. Current methods of monitoring aSyn toxicity levels in cell culture require inducing cellular differentiation, a process that is time-consuming, costly, and highly susceptible to variations in experimental conditions from one lab to another. Additionally, the current cellular model is insensitive to the toxic effects of aSyn, making it very difficult to monitor the effect of treatment on aSyn toxicity.Purdue University researchers have developed an assay to address these challenges that uses an undifferentiated immortalized cell line that expresses aSyn at high levels. Importantly, aSyn is thought to carry out its neurotoxic effect in part by disrupting mitochondrial function; the new assay takes advantage of cell culture conditions to ensure that cells retain functional mitochondria. As a result, this assay displays pronounced aSyn toxicity enabling more robust measurement of a treatment's effect on toxicity. Because this assay does not require differentiation of the cell line, it is also more reproducible and less time-consuming.Advantages: -Less costly -Faster-Less susceptible to variation Potential Applications: -Screening assay for Parkinson's disease drug discovery-Interrogation of Parkinson's disease biology"
Direct Contact Blood Brain Barrier Triculture,"Neurological disorders have been steadily increasing over the last several decades. While drug discovery and development efforts to mitigate these diseases have concurrently increased to meet the change in prevalence, clinical translation into marketed products have been hindered. One of the main difficulties in creating this translation is the lack of a model that can predict the ability of new chemical entities to permeate through the brain blood barrier (BBB). Current models suffer from leakiness of the in vitro cellular tight junctions and that leakiness leads researchers to overestimate the amount of drug permeation.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a model that represents a more restrictive, accurate model of the BBB. This model is a direct contact, triculture model containing astrocytes, pericytes, and the brain microvessel endothelial cells (BMEC) configured in a physiologically similar manner to an in vivo BBB. This method allows for direct contact between the pericytes and the astrocytes and measures the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) as an indirect measure of cell tightness.  Researchers monitor the TEER until they determine a window in which a triculture would be of utility for permeability studies. This model will offer superior selectivity for screening neuroactive or neurotoxicant agents in vitro and help in the rational selection of candidates for advancement into further clinical studies based on its physiological similarity to the in vivo BBB cellular configuration. This model may also be adopted to select compounds that have a lower potential of eliciting a neurotoxicant effect.Advantages:-More accurate model representing the BBB-Allows materials to permeate through it-Allows for direct contact between the astrocytes and pericytesPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceuticals-Research & Development-Drug discovery"
RNAi-Based Treatment for Chronic Liver Diseases,"According to the 2010 National Hospital Discharge Survey as published by the CDC, over 101,000 patients in the United States were hospitalized due to chronic liver disease, including fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease, and liver cancer. In the same year, there were 36,427 deaths related to chronic liver disease. One of the strongest genetic risk factors for developing chronic liver disease is the I148M mutation of the PNPLA3 gene. In models, it was confirmed that reducing the 148M isoform resulted in reduced fat accumulation, which affects the development of fatty liver disease in humans. Reducing the expression of this 148M isoform is a promising mechanism for slowing or reversing the progression of chronic liver disease.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a small-interfering RNA (siRNA) that specifically targets the 148M isoform. This siRNA reduces the expression of 148M mRNA while having minimal effect on the 148I isoform. This siRNA shows promise as a therapy for fatty liver disease and other types of chronic liver disease.Advantages:-Targets the genetic mutation that causes chronic liver disease-Affects the responsible isoform with minimal other effects-Models have shown reduced fat accumulationPotential applications:-Therapy for chronic liver disease"
Carrier-Free Nanoparticle Formulation with Good Circulation Stability,"Nearly 40 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients under development are poorly soluble in aqueous media leading to low bioavailability and erratic absorption. In an attempt to solve this issue, researchers began to develop nanocrystals of these insoluble drugs. Nanocrystals have increased dissolution rates, offering increased solubility. However, fast-dissolving small nanocrystals provide little advantage to solution formulations, and larger nanocrystals are recognized by the immune system.  In addition, current nanoparticle formulations can contain greater than 50 percent excipients; the excipients often present their own adverse effects, which limit the dose.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method to produce pharmaceutical nanocrystals comprised of more than 85 percent of their respective active ingredients. These nanocrystals are coated with albumin to prevent the immune response and allow the nanocrystals to target cancerous cells unhindered. These nanocrystals have the potential to increase the effectiveness of a wide range of drugs as they contain a much greater percentage of active ingredients, allow for increased bioavailability, and avoid immune recognition.Advantages:-Increases bioavailability of insoluble drugs-Fewer adverse effects-Avoids immune recognitionPotential Applications:-Drug formulationRelated Publications:J. Park, et al., Albumin-coated nanocrystals for carrier-free delivery of paclitaxel. Journal of Controlled Release (2016). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.12.040"
"Identification of Antimicrobial Peptides from Soy Protein
","Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) can inactivate bacteria, enveloped viruses, and fungi.  AMP is a viable alternative for overcoming antibiotic resistance, which poses a serious threat to public health globally.  Naturally occurring AMPs are expensive and have limited availability.  Developing synthetic AMPs is also expensive given the extensive screening process of potential candidates and risk of toxicity.  There is a need for an inexpensive process that can identify naturally occurring AMPs.Purdue University researchers have developed a method to identify naturally occurring AMPs based on the physical characteristics of the peptide and the interactions of the peptides with a mixed phospholipid layer, which mimics bacterial cells, using molecular dynamics simulation. Compared to other research methods, this method is based on the physical characteristics of the compound rather than empirical and bioinformatics data. This research method was validated by the discovery of a peptide segment derived from soy protein with antimicrobial properties. Effects of the peptide were demonstrated against Gram-positive Listeria and Gram-negative E. coli. Characteristics of the soy peptide allow its use in a number of applications such as an antibiotic replacement to address antimicrobial resistance, a supplement to animal feed, and in antimicrobial packaging in food safety applications. In addition, this method can serve as a research tool for the discovery of more peptides with antimicrobial properties in the future. Advantages:-Research based on physical characteristics-Soy peptide has antimicrobial properties-Demonstrated effects against Listeria and E. coliPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical research-Food packaging-Animal feed supplementRelated publication:Methodology for identification of pore forming antimicrobial peptides from soy protein subunits beta-conglycinin and glycinin. Peptides, Volume 85, November 2016, Pages 27-40."
MiniPharm: Miniaturized Continuous End-to-End Manufacturing of Solid Pharmaceuticals,"Current development and manufacturing processes of solid active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are inconsistent, inefficient, inflexible, and contribute to the high cost of drug products incurred by patients.  Existing API production technologies are based on batch configurations and are not integrated, have a large footprint, and lack real-time process monitoring and control.  These issues, among many others, lead to variable product quality, high labor costs, and suboptimal use of raw materials and inventories.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology that is a continuous end-to-end pharmaceutical manufacturing platform (MiniPharm) using microfluidic and 3D printing and milling technologies for the robust and continuous manufacture of solid API. Using previously inaccessible flow chemistries, the MiniPharm is highly reproducible and controllable. The MiniPharm consists of a network of reconfigurable pharmaceutical unit operations with a specially sculpted microchamber. Each unit is designed to be a module that can be flexibly switched in and out depending on real-time medical demand.  Hence, the MiniPharm can be easily reconfigured and adapted to the specific requirement of each API production. These units are exceptionally scalable, requiring the addition of other modules in parallel to increase throughput. The modules also provide flexibility and agility for real-time product releases to overcome manufacturing challenges such as drug surplus and shortage. The MiniPharm is equipped with innovative anti-fouling control to address the interruption of operations due to fouling to which current pharmaceutical manufacturing processes are prone. Advantages:-API consistency-Scalability-Flexibility-Portability-Anti-fouling controlPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industry-Drug manufacturers"
Library of Broad-Spectrum Coronavirus Therapeutics,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are viruses that infect humans and a wide variety of animals. The more virulent strains include those resulting in widespread human infection and diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Human CoVs originate from a jump between species known as zoonotic shifts. As zoonotic shifts occur, the medical field does their best to create vaccines and therapeutics to combat these diseases. Vaccines exist for canine CoV, avian infectious bronchitis virus, and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis CoV; however, there is currently no treatment for human CoV infections.Researchers from Purdue University have developed a series of 48 peptidomimetic compounds as broad-spectrum inhibitors of the CoV 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Five compounds present themselves as successful inhibitors of all alpha- and beta-CoV CL3pro's tested, and 28 compounds inhibit at least one 3CLpro. In the past, the focus has been on developing vaccines that are specialized to one strand or class of virus. With the current developments, multiple strands of CoVs can be treated by administering the anti-CoV drug. These 3CLpro inhibitors hold promise as a much needed treatment for a number respiratory diseases cause by CoV that infect humans as a result of zoonotic shifts.Advantages:-Wider spectrum of use-Therapeutic treatmentPotential Applications:-Drug development-Viral disease research-Coronaviruses-Zoonotic diseases"
Novel Aryl Isonitrile Antimicrobials Active Against Clinically Important Bacterial Strains,"Antibiotics and infectious disease therapy made huge strides in the last century; however, the emergence of resistant strains and superbugs has increased. In the United States alone, 2 million people each year are affected by these infections, resulting in over 23,000 fatalities. Out of these, nearly half are caused by the pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and VRSA) cause a range of diseases including superficial skin infections, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and bloodstream infections. These strains have become resistant to nearly every class of antibiotics, including agents of last resort, such as vancomycin and linezolid.Researchers at Purdue University have identified a novel class of compounds that have an aryl isonitrile moiety that shows potent inhibitory activity against clinically important strains of MRSA and VRSA, Bacillus anthracis, and Listeria monocytogenes. These compounds demonstrate strong antimicrobial activity against MRSA strains that are resistant to numerous antibiotic classes such as penicillins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, lincosamides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. Not only are these compounds potent, they do not show any apparent toxicity against mammalian cells up to a concentration of 64 micrometers, compared to other antibiotics that have a narrow therapeutic to toxic concentration range. In addition, analysis implies that cross-resistance between other antibiotics and these aryl isonitrile compounds is unlikely. Hence, these compounds have the potential for use as future alternatives to other antibiotics for the treatment of resistant strains of MRSA and VRSA in clinical settings.  Advantages:-Potent antimicrobial activity-Minimal toxicity at high concentrations-Effective against resistant strainsPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industry-Drug R&D-Alternative antimicrobial therapy-Treatment of antibiotic-resistant strainsRelated Publications:Davis, Dexter C., et al. Discovery and Characterization of Aryl Isonitriles as a New Class of Compounds Versus Methicillin- andVancomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Synthesis of Enantiomerically Pure Alcohols Useful for the Synthesis of Natural Products and Other Biologically Active Compounds,"Asymmetric synthesis of chiral compounds remains a significant challenge to synthetic organic chemists as the demand for enantiomerically pure compounds continues to increase. Chirality greatly influences a drug's biological and pharmacological properties. Advances in the synthesis of chiral tertiary alkyl-containing compounds have been made through the development of catalytic asymmetric alkene hydrogenation, epoxidation, and carboalumination. However, in cases where the initial enantiomeric excess of the crude product is low or where two groups around the chiral center are chemically similar, enantiomeric purification of the crudely obtained products is difficult and synthetically impractical. Purdue University researchers have developed a synthesis for tertiary 1-alkanols yielding greater than 99 percent enantiomeric purity. First, an alcohol is coupled to a branching group using the ZACA reagent. A subsequent purification method is then used to yield a product of greater than 99 percent enantiomeric excess. A wide range of enantiomerically pure compounds, including valuable biologically relevant isoprenoid and deoxypolypropionate natural products, can be synthesized using this strategy.Advantages: -Yields greater than 99 percent enantiomeric purity -Applicable to a wide range of compounds Potential Applications: -Synthesis of chiral 1-alkanols-Synthesis of natural products-derived pharmaceuticals"
Peptoid Cancer Drugs Targeting PCNA Designed via a Novel in Silico/In Vitro Pipeline,"Fragment-based drug discovery is a popular method used to design molecules that bind to protein targets. In this method, many small compounds are screened for their binding to a target protein. Subsequently, steps are undertaken to combine more than one of the small compounds found to bind weakly into a larger, stronger-binding, drug-like compound. Fragment-based drug discovery presents a significant challenge; information must be known about the binding sites of the fragments so that they can be combined in a way that does not disrupt the binding of the individual fragments. In addition, many important drug target proteins participate in protein-protein interactions. Disrupting such interactions is critical to disrupting the chemical signals that drive cancer and other diseases.To overcome the challenges of traditional fragment-based drug design, researchers at Purdue University used a combination of computational and experimental technique to discover novel inhibitors of the interaction between proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and a peptide that binds to a site on PCNA responsible for multiple protein-protein interactions relevant to its cellular function. Specifically, thousands of tripeptoids (peptide-like molecules with three chemically distinct sites) were screened in silico, facilitating the selection of a small number of tripeptoids for in vitro testing. Several of the selected tripeptoids show a good ability to disrupt the PCNA-peptide interaction. This method of drug discovery successfully identified a small number of hit compounds that disrupt a protein-protein interaction involving PCNA, an important cancer target.Advantages: -Potential first-in-class cancer drug-Fewer compounds synthesized -Less structural information needed than in traditional fragment-based drug discovery-Well-suited to targeting protein-protein interactionsPotential Applications: -Drug discovery-Cancer therapy"
Aromatase Inhibitor Breast Cancer Therapeutics with Reduced Potential for Side Effects,"Aromatase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens, which is a crucial step in the biosynthesis of estrogens in the human body. Hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer cells are stimulated by estrogen; therefore, aromatase inhibitors (AI) have been widely used for treatment of this cancer in postmenopausal women. Despite the efficacy of AIs, these drugs have a variety of side effects including joint pain and susceptibility to bone fracture. More than 10 percent of patients discontinue AI therapy after six months due to musculoskeletal toxicity.To combat these side effects, researchers at Purdue University have developed a compound with dual activity as an aromatase inhibitor and selective estrogen receptor modulator. The compound's activity as a selective estrogen receptor modulator promises a way to avoid the undesired side effects. The compound's display binding to both aromatase and estrogen receptors and modulate estrogen receptor activity in vitro.Advantages: -Fewer potential side effects than current aromatase inhibitors-Modulates estrogen receptors  Potential Applications: -Breast cancer treatmentRelated Publications:Lv, Wei, et al. Synthesis of Triphenylethylene Bisphenols as Aromatase Inhibitors That Also Modulate EstrogenReceptors. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. 2016, 59, pp 157-170.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01677."
Questionnaire to Screen Adverse Patient Drug Reactions and Effects,"Many patients today are prescribed multiple medications to treat various health concerns. As the number of medications available grows, it becomes difficult for the doctor, pharmacist, and patient to know which medications are resulting in adverse drug reactions and effects. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a screening system, Pharmaceutical Therapy Related Quality of Life (PTRQoL) instrument. The PTRQoL system is a set of questionnaires that identify adverse drug reactions and effects associated with the 200 most popular prescription drugs. The PTRQoL system could be used by patients at a computer kiosk while they wait for their prescriptions to be filled. When the pharmacist is counseling the patient, they can utilize the results of the questionnaire to identify and focus on existing issues the patient may be experiencing. The PTRQoL system could also be used for mail-order patients to increase pharmacist/patient interaction.To view a video related to this technology, click this link:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJfv8S6ox0oAdvantages: -Patent is better served-Enhanced pharmacist/patient interaction-Pharmacies will be able to provide better, cost-effective counselingPotential Applications:-Pharmacies-Physicians-Patients"
Nonantimicrobial Used Against Bacterial Infections,"In the last century, the development of antimicrobials used to treat serious infections has helped the medical field take huge strides towards curing patients; however, there is a growing need for better antimicrobials due to the emergence of serious multidrug resistant infections. There is a deficiency of medications against resistant strains as more research is focusing on new drug discovery, which can be time-consuming, costly, and of high risk. In addition, it is difficult to get these medications to market due to strict FDA regulations. To find new solutions to this problem, a Purdue University researcher has developed a new method of drug repurposing, which helps to identify three drugs, auranofin, ebselen, and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd), as potent antimicrobial agents against Gram-positive pathogens such as MRSA. Although these drugs had other FDA approved indications, expanding their use to antimicrobial therapy would increase medication options for infections. Since these drugs are either FDA-approved drugs or clinically safe molecules that have an established pharmacokinetic and safety profile, it will significantly reduce the time and cost required to bring these drugs to clinical trials. Furthermore, they have greater oral bioavailability, potent bacterial killing activity, very low frequency of resistance, suppression of bacterial virulence factors and toxin production, potent anti-biofilm activity, and good penetration and killing of intracellular MRSA. These drugs can be used as antimicrobial medicines in hospitals and clinics for seriously ill patients with infections. This improvement in research also allows for the discovery of other drugs that can be repurposed and used as antimicrobials. Advantages: -Repurposed use of non-antimicrobials against infections -Less time consuming and costly for clinical trial data -Efficient antimicrobial activity against MRSA Potential Applications: -Pharmaceuticals -Gram-positive pathogen treatment"
Inexpensive Crystallinity Detection for Pharmaceuticals and Other Formulations ,"Many of today's modern pharmaceuticals utilize Amorphous Solid Dispersions (ASDs) in an attempt to increase the overall effectiveness of a drug. Unfortunately, compounds using ASDs have the potential to crystallize, changing from an amorphous solid to a crystalline solid over an indeterminate time. Before such a drug can be released, stability studies must be performed to determine the viability of the drug after extended time. This normally requires the compound to be subjected to months of elevated temperature and humidity. This expensive, time-consuming process often leads to major backups in the drug development process. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a simple, inexpensive method for the detection of trace crystallinity in pharmaceutical formulations. This new method uses the inherent ability of crystalline compounds to support triboluminescence. By transferring kinetic energy to the sample, trace amounts of crystals can be detected by measuring the optical radiation caused by the triboluminescence of the compound. This new method allows for trace crystallinity in new drugs to be quickly and accurately identified by a simple and relatively inexpensive test.

Vinyl Ether Lipids with Cleavable Hydrophilic Headgroups Target Cell Cytoplasm with More Stability and Efficiency,"Liposome-encapsulated drugs have used both passive and active targeting schemes to specifically deliver their payloads to target tissues in vivo. Unfortunately, existing methods for transporting the liposomal contents to the targeted cell cytoplasm are either inefficient or lack sufficient stability for practical therapeutic applications. Researchers at Purdue University have developed novel materials capable of inducing phase changes (fluid-gel, lamellar-hexagonal, hexagonal-isotropic) upon exposure to mildly oxidative or acidic conditions. The responsiveness of these materials is dependent on the degree of the applied stress; for example, no phase change occurs at pH7, whereas pH5 and pH 11 cause phase changes on the hours and minutes timescales, respectively. These materials are appropriate for controlled release in biomedical applications, including drug and gene delivery, polymer hydrogels, and tissue engineering, as well as formulations in the personal care products, food processing, and surfactant industries. Advantages: - Novel, liposome forming molecules - Biocompatible and externally controllable - Cost effective - Improves cytoplasmic delivery of liposome contentsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug development-Food industry"
Compounds with Potential Use in Development of Medications for the Treatment of Multidrug Resistant HIV-1,"HIV/AIDS is one of the top deadly diseases worldwide that is still common despite progress in healthcare. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is a complex disease that includes gradual destruction of the immune system. Many current therapies that are available for the management of the disease are limited by their duration of action, side effect profile and toxicity, and their extensive pill burden. Hence, there is a need to find newer therapies for HIV/AIDS. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a series of non-peptide HIV-1 protease inhibitors that incorporate a basic amine function in the inhibitor structure. These compounds are novel and show enzyme inhibition and antiviral activity at subnanomolar levels. In addition, they have been shown to have potent activity against multidrug resistant HIV-1 strains and are expected to have improved metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic properties. These compounds have potential use in the pharmaceutical industry for the development of superior HIV medications and in healthcare for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Advantages: -HIV-1 protease inhibitor -Potent activity against resistant strains -Improved stability and pharmacokinetics Potential Applications: -Pharmaceutical industry -Drug development -Medical/Healthcare -Treatment of HIV/AIDS"

Dihydroquinazoline-Derived Inhibitors for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive mental deterioration, resulting in loss of memory, confusion and disorientation, and other behavioral problems. Unfortunately, no definitive cure has been developed to treat this disease. Beta-secretase, an important enzyme in the development and onset of Alzheimer's disease, contributes to the formation of amyloid-beta peptides that aggregate in the brain of Alzheimer's patients. Blocking beta-secretase is a potential strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Researchers at Purdue University have developed novel compounds that inhibit beta-secretase for Alzheimer's treatment. By focusing on a known dihydroquinazoline scaffold, a series of novel dihydroquinazoline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated. Several compounds in this series were shown to exhibit better beta-secretase cellular inhibitory activity compared to current compounds reported in literature. These compounds show increased potency, improved aqueous solubility, increased metabolic stability, and improved oral bioavailability.Advantages:-Improved beta-secretase cellular inhibition-Increased metabolic stabilityPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical industry"
Peptidomimetic Inhibitors for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive mental deterioration, resulting in loss of memory, confusion and disorientation, and other behavioral problems. Unfortunately, no definitive cure has been developed to treat this disease. Beta-secretase, an important enzyme in the development and onset of Alzheimer's disease, contributes to the formation of amyloid-beta peptides that aggregate in the brain of Alzheimer's patients. Blocking beta-secretase is a potential strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a series of novel compounds for beta-secretase inhibition that offer improved pharmacological properties. Novel peptidomimetic scaffolds were utilized to replace conventional hydroxyethylamine isosteres and were shown to be good inhibitors of beta-secretase. This series of compounds shows increased potency, improved aqueous solubility, increased metabolic stability, and improved oral bioavailability over previously identified inhibitors or beta-secretase.Advantages:-Improved pharmacological properties-Shown to be good inhibitors of beta-secretasePotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical Industry"
Precise Method to Lower Detection Limits of Nucleation Onset Using Raman and XRD ,"Modern drug discovery frequently identifies active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that are highly effective against the disease target, but which are hard to deliver to the body. As a result, second harmonic generation (SHG) has emerged as a complementary technique for the rapid detection and quantification of trace crystallinity within pharmaceutical materials. Despite the low detection limits of SHG microscopy, the SHG intensity itself provides insufficient chemical information about the composition of the SHG-active source. There is unmet need to obtain such information.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method utilizing SHG microscopy to identify regions of interest for localized confocal Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements to quantify crystallinity and identify composition within formulations of pharmaceutical materials. By targeting the Raman and XRD analysis to these localized regions identified by SHG, the corresponding reduction in background, lowered the limits of detection for both Raman and XRD by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude relative to ensemble-averaged measurements. Targeted analysis by XRD and Raman spectroscopy were both consistent with crystalline paclitaxel comprising the insoluble particles. These combined results show the potential benefits provided by the marriage of the rapid and highly selective technique of SHG with information-rich methods such as Raman and XRD.Advantages:-Enable targeted analysis by Raman and XRD-Reduces the time required to perform the Raman measurements-Improvements in the detection limits for trace crystallinityPotential Applications:-SHG Microscopy -Spectroscopy-Synchrotron x-ray diffraction"
Microfluid Platform to Screen Cancer Drug for Delivery,"Developing and testing cancer drugs is an expensive process that requires, among other things, exhaustive in vivo animal experiments. One purpose of preclinical animal studies is to analyze how effectively a drug is transported and delivered to its target in a tumor mass. However, animal testing can be an expensive, slow process.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a microfluidic platform to simulate a 3D tumor vasculature system. This innovative platform can mimic the complex transport processes inside a tumor, such as transvascular transport, interstitial transport, and transmembrane transport. These processes are all simulated on a single benchtop device, thus improving the repeatability and speed of testing, while reducing the cost and use of animals in drug discovery.Advantages:-Mimics multiple transport processes-Increased repeatability and speed for drug testing-Low costPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical industry-Drug development-Research labsRelated Publications:Bumsoo Han. Physics-inspired micro/nanotherapeutics:  Same problem, different approaches. Molecular Pharmaceutics, July 5, 2016, Vol. 13 (7), pp. 2141-2142. DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00482."
Affinity Stabilization of Protein Drugs,"The development of protein drugs is often hindered by the instability of these large, complex molecules. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel method for stabilizing protein drugs based on ligand binding. The peptide epitopes are covalently linked to a biodegradable synthetic polymer, forming a pseudo-ligand. The pseudo-ligand binds to the protein drug with high affinity and helps to preserve near-native conformation, minimize unfolding, and prevent aggregation during manufacturing, shipping, and storage. Since the pseudo-ligand is comprised of a biodegradable polymer backbone and small peptide epitopes, it is expected to be biocompatible and nonimmunogenic. In some applications, it may be desirable to administer the protein drug in its free form. In such cases, the pseudo-ligand can be immobilized on a solid surface through a coupling agent and released prior to administration using a competing ligand.Advantages:-Preserves near-native conformation-Biocompatible and nonimmunogenicPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industryRelated Publications:Zhang, Jun, et al. Protein G, Protein A and Protein A-Derived Peptides Inhibit the Agitation Induced Aggregation of IgG. Molecular Pharmaceutics. 2012, 9 (3), pp 622–628.DOI: 10.1021/mp200548x."
Smart Capsule,"In recent years, smart capsules, which once ingested, can perform endoscopy and biopsy, have been the focus of intense research and development. Site-specific delivery can optimize the therapeutic efficacy of many drugs with preferential absorption sites. Although many smart capsules have been developed that are suitable for drug absorption studies in clinical settings, they cannot be used for actual therapy in larger populations that can benefit from smart capsules, which releases the drug at an optimum location in the gastrointestinal tract. This is mainly due to the problems associated with the need for real-time tracking of the capsule location. In addition, all these systems require active participation by the patient/volunteer in the form of triggering the RF transmitter once the capsule is in the target position. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a smart capsule for location-specific drug release in the gastrointestinal tract. Once activated through a magnetic proximity fuse, the capsule opens and releases its powdered payload in a location specified by an implanted miniature magnetic marker or an externally worn larger magnet. The capsule (9 mm x 26 mm) has two compartments, one contains a charged capacitor and a reed switch, while the other houses the drug reservoir capped by a taut nylon thread intertwined with a nichrome wire. The nichrome wire is connected to the capacitor through the reed switch. The capacitor is charged to 2.7V before ingestion, and once within the proximity of the permanent magnet, the reed switch closes, discharging the capacitor through the nichrome wire, melting the nylon thread, detaching the cap, and emptying the drug reservoir. Advantages: -Enables targeted delivery of drugs to a specific location in GI track -Patient does not have to be in a hospital or clinic to use-Preferred capsule size (9 mm x 26 mm) Potential Applications: -Medical/Healthcare-Medical testing-Pharmaceutical industry -Supplement industry"
Potent Protease Inhibitors Against HIV ,"Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), has been one of the most difficult to manage diseases despite the progress in medicine. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes AIDS, which is a complex disease that includes gradual destruction of the immune system and deterioration of the central and peripheral nervous system. Therapy that has been used to treat HIV is highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV protease inhibitors (PI), and reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs). However, these therapies have multiple side effects in patients, complexities in the treatment regimen, and development of multidrug resistance. In addition, many of the agents cannot reach residual HIV in the brain, and therefore, it is very important to develop medications that can pass into the brain. In light of these evolving issues, researchers at Purdue University have developed a therapy to combat the HIV pandemic. They have found that nonpeptidyl compounds are strong inhibitors of HIV-1 protease enzymes. The unique structure, which includes urethanes with P2 ligand activity, make these inhibitors effective in attaching to the enzyme's active portion with strong hydrogen bonds and deterring the function of HIV and other multidrug resistant strains of the virus. Currently, these compounds have demonstrated less toxicity and higher potency, which may result in lower doses compared to traditional AIDS medications. These compounds could be used  in combination with current therapies or alone to provide a therapeutically effective, safe treatment of AIDS. Advantages: -More potent, lower doses used -Less toxicities and side effects -Effective against resistant HIV strainsPotential Applications:-AIDS prevention and treatment"
Therapy for Vaso-Occlusive Crisis in Sickle Cell Disease,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic disease as patients suffer from recurring episodes of sickle cell crisis, extreme pain associated with the obstruction of one or more blood vessels and resultant inflammatory events. A clustering of sickle cells, possibly due to microparticle release during oxidative stress, has been associated with the onset of vascular obstruction. Severe pain results when blood vessels are blocked; this vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) has been described as severe and life-limiting. Currently, the management of VOC requires hospitalization, which usually begins in the emergency room, chronic administration of the drug hydroxyurea, and episodic administration of opioid analgesics such as morphine. Frequent opioid use induces drug tolerance, increased dosing, and problems with dependence, which further increases the burden on patients.The root of the problem in SCD arises from issues in band 3, a red blood cell membrane protein, which is hyperphosphorylated. However, the most influence on band 3 comes from spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), which seems to phosphorylate tyrosine 8 and 21 on band 3. The use of SYK inhibitors in these cases will significantly decrease both band 3 phosphorylation, decrease the number of microparticles in circulation, and prevent the initiation of thrombosis and VOC. By using this concept to find a therapeutic replacement, researchers at Purdue University have proposed the use of a prophylactic treatment with a SYK inhibitor, which could reduce or eliminate the recurrence of sickle cell crisis in both adults and children suffering from SCD. Patients can be administered an inhibitor, such as Gleevec® (imatinib mesylate), an orally-dosed, antineoplastic drug for the treatment of cancers, such as metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors, chronic myeloid leukemia, relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic eosinophilic leukemia. This would be a new, off-label indication of this medication, but the dosage used would still fall within guidelines previously established in the original, approved indication, thus making this safe.Advantages:-Efficient inhibition of band 3 phosphorylation-Prevention and/or reduction of vaso-occlusive events-Less complicated therapy and managementPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical Industry-Medical/Health -Sickle cell disease treatment"
Increased Proinsulin Yield Using Tandem Reagents,"Insulin is a therapeutic protein that is produced to treat diabetes mellitus. In 2011, global insulin sales reached $16.7 billion, with a large part being produced in E. coli. In such systems, insulin is expressed as the precursor proinsulin and stored in the E. coli cells as inclusion bodies. To produce insulin, the inclusion bodies must be isolated, denatured, undergo sulfitolysis, and be refolded to form proinsulin. During the in vitro folding of Methionine-Arginine Lyspro-Proinsulin-S-sulfonate (MR-KPB-hPSS), a significant fraction of the folding intermediates aggregate through intermolecular disulfide bond formation, resulting in a yield loss near 40 percent. Therefore, reducing aggregation during in vitro folding can increase the production yield of insulin. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new method using two synergistic folding agents in tandem to convert MR-KPB-hPSS to correctly folded Methionine-Arginine-Lyspro-Proinsulin with an average folding yield of approximately 72 percent. This method uses redox agents in tandem to simultaneously refold MR-KPB-hPSS and reduce aggregation. If purchased at $749/100g, the additional cost to the insulin production process is $1.48 per gram. With the per-unit cost to produce insulin estimated at $50 to $75 per gram, the additional cost to this process is largely offset by the increase in yield. Thus, the proposed changes to conventional proinsulin folding methods can result in significant cost savings for industrial scale insulin manufacturing. Advantages: -Average folding yield increased from 53 percent to over 73 percent -Significant cost savings for industrial-scale insulin manufacturing Potential Applications:-Pharmaceutical Industry-Medical/Healthcare"
Neuropathic and Inflammatory Pain Therapeutics Targeting Adenylyl Cyclase,"Chronic pain, such as neuropathic pain, is common in multiple diseases and is a major health concern. Due the multifaceted nature of pain, its basic mechanism is poorly understood; therefore, current therapies are do not meet the needs of many patients. Researchers have identified adenylyl cyclase type 1 (AC1) as a potential target for pain therapy. This enzyme is present in neurons, but not in heart, liver, or kidney cells, which would minimize side effects of AC1 inhibitors to non-neuronal tissues. Currently, only one inhibitor against AC1, called NB001, has been identified. There is a need to identify new therapeutics that target AC1. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a series of compounds that inhibit AC1 in cell culture with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. In addition, these new AC1 inhibitors can be produced via mild and efficient reaction chemistry with high regioselectivity, stereoselectivity, and excellent yield. This new technology will not only facilitate chronic pain therapy but provides an effective synthetic route to optimize these lead compounds.Advantages: -Potential first in class therapeutic for neuropathic and inflammatory pain -Fewer predicted side effects Potential Applications: -Chronic pain therapy-Pharmaceutical industryRelated Publication:Zhishi Ye et al., Palladium-Catalyzed Regio- and Stereoselective γ-Arylation of Tertiary Allylic Amines: Identification of Potent Adenylyl Cyclase InhibitorsOrg. Lett., 2015, 17 (4), pp 892–895"
Dopamine Receptor Agonists,"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is important in locomotor control, reward circuitry, cognitive function, prolactin release, and a variety of other key physiological functions. Dopaminergic dysfunctions have been implicated in many disorders including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, addiction, and ADHD. Dopamine receptor agonists are of interest in terms of finding successful therapies for these disorders. However, current D1 and D2 receptor agonists can have adverse side effects depending on the level and timing of use. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a class of novel D1 dopamine agonists, or stimulants, which may be useful in treating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and other working memory and cognitive deficits. This series of compounds has potent and selective activity at dopamine D1 receptors, making them useful therapeutic agents in hypodopaminergic conditions. Recent studies have also shown that dopamine D1 agonists are able to reverse drug-induced and age-related deficits in working memory. Advantages: -Novel class of dopamine agonists -Potent and selective activity -Clinical precedentPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industry"
Method for Detection of Transiently Interacting Proteins,"Identification of upstream kinases is extremely important to drug discovery, especially for finding drug lead compounds, improving drug efficacy, and combating drug-resistant diseases. Currently available technologies identify kinase substrates; however, there is no existing high throughput technology for identification of a key phosphoprotein's upstream kinases.Purdue University researchers have developed a high-throughput platform to isolate and analyze proteins that only transiently interact under physiological conditions, such as upstream kinases and their substrates. The platform achieves this by combining a protein-fragment complementation assay with mass spectrometry. The researchers use fluorescence protein fragments to stabilize the weak and transient kinase-substrate interactions for mass spectrometry analysis, a method termed fluorescence complementation affinity proteomics (FCAP). Mass spectrometry allows for the unambiguous sequencing of interacting proteins and provides the ability to distinguish specific interacting partners from false identifications through quantitative proteomics. Major applications include pharmaceutical and biotechnology research and development.Advantages:-High throughput technology-Identifies upstream kinases-Does not introduce false positives-Identifying drug lead compounds-Improves drug efficacy-Combats drug-resistance diseasesPotential Applications:-Drug discovery-Pharmaceuticals-BiotechnologyRelated Publications:Lingfei Zeng, et al.

Novel Diabetes Treatment,"Diabetes is a widely prevalent disease that currently affects 25.8 million people in the United States. The predominant form of diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from a combination of reduction in pancreatic beta cell activity and mass, which leads to insufficient insulin production. An enzyme called memapsin 1 is known to be part of the biochemical pathway that leads to the problems with pancreatic beta cells and ultimately causes insulin deficiency. Memapsin 1 deactivates a transmembrane protein shown to increase beta cell proliferation and improve glucose stimulated insulin secretion. The transmembrane protein is deactivated when it undergoes ectodomain cleavage in a process triggered by memapsin 1. Researchers at Purdue University in collaboration with Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation have developed and assayed a series of lead compounds that act as memapsin 1 inhibitors and increase pancreatic beta cell mass. Treatment with these compounds may also be complimented by other therapeutics that increase insulin production, improve glucose homeostasis, or inhibit hyperglucagonemia. Advantages: -Improved glucose homeostasis -Specific enzyme pathway regulationPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals"
Novel Anticancer Compounds,"Natural product antitumor compounds, such as FR901464 and spliceostatin A, have particular interest in clinical applications due to their remarkable antitumor activity and effectiveness against human solid tumors. More significantly, both FR901464 and spliceostatin A potently inhibit in vitro splicing and promote pre-mRNA accumulation. The first total synthesis of FR901464 was accomplished in 29-41, which made the original methods time consuming and costly. In addition, it was difficult to produce a pure form of the compound. Researchers at Purdue University have developed concise, enantioselective syntheses of pure FR901464 and spliceostatin A, which can be accomplished in only 10 and 9 linear steps, respectively. By drastically decreasing the number of steps, this method is cost efficient, convergent, and amenable to the synthesis of structural variants. The researchers have already developed nine synthetic analogues, which are potentially more potent and bioactive, as well as synthesized several other high-quality, natural products such as jasplakinolide and lasonolide A. Advantages: -Efficient and cost effective -Amenable to the synthesis of structural variantsPotential Applications:-Pharmaceuticals-Drug development-Cancer treatment"
A Class of Exceptionally Potent HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors,"As reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), globally, there were 35.3 million people living with HIV/AIDS in 2012, a number that has been growing due to the increased availability of antiviral treatments. After peaking from 1997 to 2011, the incidence rate has declined nearly 30 percent from 3.5 million to 2.5 million, and within the last 10 years, the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the combination of at least three antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, within low- and middle-income regions has increased nearly 20-fold. Despite these advances, there is still great need for novel, more powerful treatments to fight new, drug resistant strains of the disease. Researchers at Purdue University have designed, synthesized, and evaluated a series of exceptionally potent HIV-1 protease inhibitors for the treatment of AIDS and HIV infections. These compounds represent a novel new class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors that include Tp-THF and other substituted ligands in combination with P1, P1', and P2' ligands. These compounds have demonstrated potency against wild-type viruses as well as multidrug resistant strains of HIV-1. Certain compounds exhibit nearly 100 times more potency than the current, standard HIV therapy. Advantages: -Exceptionally potent against wild-type and multidrug resistant strains of HIV-1 -Potency could reduce dosage requirements while maintaining efficacyPotential Applications:-HIV therapy"
"Chromeno[4,3,2-de]isoquinolines as Potent Dopamine Receptor Ligands","According to the Parkinson's Disease Foundation, as many as one million people in the U.S. have Parkinson's disease, with approximately 60,000 new diagnoses annually. Worldwide, there are an estimated 7 to 10 million people living with this disease. Reduced dopamine transmission is known to be a cause of Parkinson's disease.  While a dopamine precursor, levodopa, can be used to alleviate dopamine depletion, it has a very short pharmacokinetic life and increased doses are required over time to achieve desired therapeutic results. Dopamine agonist drugs have been used to activate post synaptic dopamine receptors and allow the available dopamine in the brain to bind efficiently to these receptors. These agonists can be used in monotherapy applications or in conjunction with the standard levodopa therapy. A compound developed by Purdue University researchers, dinoxyline(8,9-dihydroxy-1,2,3,11b-tetragydrichromeno[4,3,2-de]isoquinoline), provides a novel class of therapeutic agents for any disorder that can be treated by drugs affecting dopamine receptors. Where dihydrexidine is ten-fold D1:D2 selective and dinapsoline is five-fold D1:D2 selective, dinoxyline has an equally high affinity for both D1 and D2 receptors. This is surprising considering the structure of this new compound in comparison to related work with other dopamine agonists. The unexpected result suggests that dinoxyline may bind to the D2 receptor in another way, which could translate into unanticipated therapeutic benefits. Advantages: -Useful in treating certain cognitive disorders and dementia-Potent anti-hypertensive effects-Provides novel strategies to treat schizophrenia and drug addictionPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industry"
Oxygen Generator to Aid Cancer Treatment,"Radiation, surgery, and chemotherapy are the three major treatments for cancer. Radiation destroys cancer cells by using high-energy photons to damage the cell's DNA. The effectiveness of radiation is dependent upon the oxygen concentration in tumors; however, the abnormal structures of tumor vasculature are leaky, lending the tumor environment hypoxic. Hypoxia can impede the success of radiation therapy because oxygen is necessary for successful cancer treatment. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an ultrasonically powered, implantable micro-oxygen generator that can increase oxygen levels in a tumor target during radiation treatment. The generator has overall dimensions of 1.2mm x 1.3mm x 8mm, so it is small enough to be implanted using a hypodermic needle. This technology performs electrolysis to generate oxygen, which may be able to restore intratumoral oxygen concentrations to a normal or hyperoxygenated level, increasing the effectiveness of cancer treatment outcomes. Advantages: -Increases effectiveness of cancer radiation treatments -Small size allows easy implantation -Ultrasonically powered using external sourcePotential Applications:-Cancer Treatment-Pharmaceuticals-Medical Devices-Medical/Health"
Synthesis of Novel Potent Nosocomial Antibiotics,"Hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections cause or contribute to 99,000 deaths each year in the United States alone. A patient's weakened state combined with bacteria's increasing resistance to antibiotics makes these infections difficult to treat. The current suite of antibiotics available for treating serious nosocomial infections, such as MRSA, can have unwanted side effects; hence, it is important to identify new antibiotics.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a class of antibiotic compounds designed to specifically target common nosocomial infections. By selectively targeting the mevalonate pathway of Gram-positive bacteria, these compounds will be more effective with fewer side effects. Several of the analogues also demonstrated selective antibacterial activity against MRSA and VRE, two of the most common and most dangerous nosocomial infections.Advantages:-Targets common nosocomial infections-Fewer side effectsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceutical Industry-Drug Development"
Dopamine Agonists,"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that has been implicated in numerous neurological disorders. For example, excess stimulation of dopamine may be linked to schizophrenia, whereas either excessive or insufficient functional dopaminergic activity may cause hypertension, narcolepsy, and other disorders including Parkinson's disease. The D1 receptor is a dopamine receptor subtype that may be a viable therapeutic target for dopamine-related pathologies. Accordingly, researchers have directed their efforts to design ligands that are selective D1 receptor agonists. Researchers at Purdue University have developed new molecules that fully and selectively activate the dopamine D1 receptor. The compounds derived are useful for treating patients having a dopamine-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) as well as conditions in which peripheral dopamine receptors are involved. They are expected to be effective against Parkinson's disease, improving cognition, memory, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and related developmental disorders. Advantages: -Lead compound is 50 times more selective for D1 receptors than for D2L receptors -Equipotent, but more selective than other D1 agonists -Potentially effective treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease and other CNS disorders -Orally bioavailable in animal modelsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceutical industry-Drug development"
Topoisomerase I Inhibitors as Potential Anticancer Agents,"Topoisomerase enzymes are involved in the restructuring of DNA during synthesis to give other enzymes easy access to copy the two strands. DNA synthesis is an important step, occurring only when a cell is proliferating. Continual proliferation is a key characteristic of cancerous cells, and thus, topoisomerases are ideal targets for cancer therapeutics. Scientists are currently attempting to synthesize  topoisomerase inhibitors that have differing target sites to more effectively eliminate cancer cells. Finding novel binding sites for inhibitors becomes paramount for overcoming drug resistance.Scientists at Purdue University have developed novel compounds to inhibit Topoisomerase I that are intended to cease DNA synthesis and cause cell death. These inhibitors will be used as the primary treatment or in a synergistic manner to treat proliferating tumors. This innovation provides a novel, efficient, and scalable, synthetic route to these compounds  that possess and express Top I inhibition and cytotoxicity.Advantages:-Anticancer properties-Cytotoxicity to a variety of cancers-Topoisomerase 1 is a proven target for cancer therapyPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Cancer Treatment-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development"
Topoisomerase I Inhibitors Substituted with Carbohydrates,"Topoisomerase I is an ideal protein to target to reduce cancer activity given it is expressed more often in cancer cells than most terminally differentiated cells. The enzyme is responsible for structural changes in the DNA protein complex, allowing enzymes easy access for DNA synthesis. Topoisomerases have an important role in regulation of the cell cycle, and when the enzyme is inhibited from completing its task, the cell will activate death pathways. Many anticancer drugs have been designed to target this protein as it is expressed in all proliferating cells, which is a common feature of transformed cells. The problem with the synthesized drugs is they are not easily metabolized by the body and their insolubility makes them difficult to develop in the laboratory, limiting bioavailability. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new topoisomerase I inhibitor that incorporates carbohydrate groups to increase solubility. The result is drug that is more bioavailable and stable, which comes with the added benefit of smaller doses acting more effectively. The synthetic route developed for these compounds is simple, versatile, and easily scalable. The newly synthesized compounds displayed potent anti-Top1 activity and ceased proliferation in transformed cells. Advantages: -Carbohydrate-substituted indenoisoquinolines overcome common problems of solubility with this drug class -Topoisomerase I is a proven target for cancer therapyPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthercare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-Cancer Treatment"
7-Azaindenoisoquinolines as Anticancer Agents,"Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) is an important protein found in the cell; it is used to unwind and reduce torsional stress on DNA during replication. TOP1 inhibitors are a useful chemotherapy agent because cells that are constantly dividing, such as cancer cells, are much more susceptible to attack; cell death will occur when topoisomerase 1 is inhibited. TOP1 inhibitors make up a large portion of the chemotherapy market because they can be used to target a wide variety of proliferating tumors. The characteristic of uninhibited division is a common feature in cancer that can be targeted without needing a specific marker for each cancer cell type. As more information becomes readily available, it is becoming apparent that within tumors there is a heterogeneous population of cells populating the primary tumor and the secondary tumors.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a series of 7-azaindenoisoquinoline derivatives that act to inhibit topoisomerase and subsequently induce cell death. This new class of topoisomerase inhibitors has the potential to possess enhanced chemical stability over traditional inhibitors, while increasing inhibitor effectiveness. Advantages: -Azaindenoisoquinolines have enhanced chemical stability and effectiveness over other TOP1 inhibitors -TOP1 is a proven target for cancer therapyPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Cancer Treatment"

Purdue University researchers have developed a novel process for synthesizing four TOP1 inhibitors and have optimized their structures for the greatest inhibitory activity and cytoxicity towards dividing cells. The compounds consist of 7-, 8-, 9-, and 10-azaindenoisoquinoline structures. Advantages: -TOP1 is a proven target for cancer therapy -Azaindenoisoquinolines have enhanced chemical stability and effectiveness over other TOP1 inhibitors"
Dual Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase/Topoisomerase Inibitors,"Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) is an enzyme involved in the replication of DNA. Molecules displaying TOP1 inhibitory function have found clinical applications as well as the frequent subject of research. Another enzyme functioning alongside TOP1 is tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), which repairs DNA lesions. Observations of this enzyme suggest mediating its activity could potentiate the cytotoxic effect of TOP1 inhibitors. TDP1 inhibitory activity has been seen to a limited extent in a handful of compounds, though their potencies, specificities, and pharmacokinetic properties leave much to be desired. Purdue University researchers have developed a series of novel, low molecular-weight compounds that can act as dual inhibitors of both TOP1 and TDP1. A dual inhibitor of this type would offer significant advantages over individual TOP1 and TDP1inhibitors alone such as simplification of delivery and bioavailability. In lab tests, the dual inhibitor is an equally potent TOP1 inhibitor as the commercially available camptothecin. These molecules are thought to function by stalling the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle, thereby inducing apoptosis, and effectively killing the cell. This drug could work in combination with other chemotherapies to effectively eliminate highly proliferative cell growth in the body. Advantages: -First dual inhibitor of TOP1 and TDP1-Shown to be as cytotoxic to TOP1 as camptothecin -A potentially more potent chemotherapy agentPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Cancer Treatment"
Tracking Cellular Internalization and Trafficking of Nanomaterials,"Understanding how drugs and viruses enter cells is paramount for better drug efficacy and for designing more targeted drugs to combat infection. Currently, traditional molecular biology techniques are used to understand the passage of a molecule from the outside of the cell to the cytoplasm. While these techniques offer a great starting point to understanding key proteins involved in transport, they only provide a snapshot of a specific interaction and miss other biomolecules that are involved in intermediate steps. Purdue University researchers have developed a multifunctional reagent to study cellular transport of molecules. The novel reagent will interact with multiple proteins necessary for transport into the cell and the resulting conjugates identified by mass spectrometry. At varying times, cellular proteins can be isolated to identify the proteins the reagent is bound to, giving investigators a better understanding of what is involved in cellular transport. Advantages:-Information to design more efficacious drugs-Learn more detailed information about cellular transport-Design more targeted drugs to treat infectionPotential Applications:-Bioinformatics-Pharmaceuticals-Chemical analysis-Drug developmentRelated Publications:Wang, Linna, et al.

Recovery of Function In Chronic Spinal Cord Injury,"In the United States, there are between 240,000 to 337,000 people chronically injured with severe behavioral loss from spinal cord damage, with approximately 12,500 new cases each year. There is currently no treatment that can recover functions for those affected. Previously, researchers at Purdue University's Center for Paralysis Research have shown 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to be clinically effective in treating chronic spinal cord injury in both dog and man; the compound is now in phase II human clinical tests. Purdue University researchers have developed chemical analogues of 4-AP with superior pharmacological properties compared to the parent compound. Special analogues and cocrystals of the compound 4-AP were synthesized and their biological properties were tested. These compounds and all related derivatives and prodrugs dissolve readily at stomach pH facilitating the distribution of the parent compound and the analogues through the body subsequent to oral intake. These drugs (under stomach pH) have been shown to improve nerve impulse conduction through injured spinal cords in in vitro experimental models. Advantages: -More effective than 4-AP -Long-term stability -Slow dissolution -Facilitates ease of clinical administrationPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals"
Synthesis of Novel Anticancer Agent Peloruside A,"Peloruside A (1), a 16-membered macrolide antitumor agent, was first isolated by L. West and P. Northcote from the New Zealand marine sponge, Mycale hentscheli.  It has shown potent antitumor activity against resistant cell lines, such as P388 murine leukemia cells with an IC50 value of 10 ng/mL. Peloruside A is a microtubule stabilizing agent operating with a similar mechanism to the most widely used anticancer agent, taxol, and has shown a synergistic effect with taxol itself. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a process for synthetic production of Peloruside A, which is amenable to the development of analogs and derivatives of this important molecule. This synthetic strategy opens the possibility of creating unnatural analogs of Peloruside A with improved potency, bioavailability, and other pharmacokinetic properties. These developments will facilitate drug discovery for cancer treatment. Advantages: -Novel synthetic pathway to highly potent cancer drug -Synthetic process amenable to drug discovery of improved therapeuticsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-Cancer Treatment"
Treatment for Demyelinating Diseases and Conditions,"Mechanical damage to the nervous system of mammals sometimes results in irreversible functional deficits. Most functional deficits associated with trauma to both the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) and Central Nervous System (CNS) result from damage to the nerve fiber or axon, blocking the flow of nerve impulse traffic along the nerve fiber. Spinal cord injury is a compression injury to the cord where the injured region of anatomically intact nerve fibers does not function. In particular, this local region (usually less than 1 vertebral segment in extent) does not conduct nerve impulses through the region of damage. 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) has shown promise in restoring nerve function in paralyzed persons; however, clinically meaningful recoveries of function only occur in about 30 percent of the treated population.  For the balance of those receiving treatment, recoveries are associated with numerous unwanted side effects, such as dizziness, loss of balance, and seizure. Researchers at Purdue University have developed analogues of 4-AP, which provide longer lasting effects at a lower concentration with fewer side effects than comparable treatments with 4-AP. The compounds, upon in vivo administration, reduced the effect of traumatic CNS tissue injury by the restoration of nerve impulse conduction through nerve tissue lesions. Advantages: -Analogue of known pharmaceutical -Restores nerve impulse and function in spinal cord injury -Longer lasting than current standard, with lower dose and fewer side effectsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals"
Synthesis and Applications of Trifluoroacetate,"The incorporation of fluorine into fine chemicals has had a significant impact in the chemical, agrochemical, and pharmaceutical industries given nearly 20 percent of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine and significantly more agrochemicals contain fluorination. Fluoroform is a gas that is used in industrial processes, but it is a potent ""greenhouse"" gas. Because of this, the use of gaseous fluoroform must be strictly limited to prevent its unwanted escape into the atmosphere. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new synthetic reagent and method for the mild and efficient preparation of fluorinated compounds. This simple and straightforward method can be accomplished by a novice chemist, at room temperature, in open air, and without the need for complicated inert atmosphere techniques. Among other intermediates, Purdue researchers validated this method through its use in the aldol and imino-aldol processes, the facile production of difluoroenolates, and the formation of alpha, alpha-difluorinated beta amino acids. Difluorinated molecules, such as beta amino acids, are important research tools and building blocks for drug discovery. Advantages: -Novel trifluoroacetate release strategy uses mild conditions (room temperature) -Generation of pharmaceutically important intermediates -Compatible with large scope of substratesPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Chemical Analysis-Drug Development"
Touch Actuated Micropump for Transdermal Drug Delivery,"Transdermal delivery of medications and other compounds has been aggressively pursued for many decades. Although patches have been used to deliver small hydrophobic molecules such as nicotine and nitroglycerin, an external pressure source in conjunction with a direct subcutaneous access port are required to deliver the majority of therapeutically important drugs through the skin. Microfluidics has played an important role in this area by providing microneedle arrays and miniature pumps. Although microneedle arrays made of silicon, polymers, and metals have reached a high degree of maturity in the past decade, their application has been limited due to the lack of a suitable micropump with adequate flow rate and back pressure.Purdue University researchers have developed a new type of pump for drug-delivery patches that would use arrays of microneedles to deliver a wider range of medications possible than with conventional patches. The pump contains a liquid that boils at body temperature so that the heat from a finger's touch causes it to rapidly turn into a vapor, exerting enough pressure to dispense the drug through the microneedles. This technology's low-cost and battery-less operation make it the ideal single-use disposable transdermal drug dispenser. Advantages:-Battery-less operation-Low-cost and disposablePotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Medical devices-Pharmaceuticals-Drug development"
Aluminum Hydroxide Adjuvants Vaccine Linkers,"Vaccines typically work by exposing the body to an antigen, which is either a weakened form of a microorganism or a toxin that it creates. This exposure stimulates an immune system response that lets the body recognize the pathogen so that it can more easily recognize and destroy it in the future. Sometimes, the proteins used in the vaccine are bound to an adjuvant (commonly aluminum hydroxide), which acts as an irritant to enhance the immune response to the antigen while reducing the amount of foreign material that must be injected. To attach the aluminum hydroxide to the protein, a phosphate group is first attached to the protein. Phosphate groups have a high electrostatic affinity for aluminum hydroxide, so they readily bond to each other. However, current techniques for attaching the phosphate group to a protein have the unintended effect of changing the structure of the protein. Purdue University researchers have developed a simple chemical reagent that attaches a phosphate group to specific sites on the protein, but does not change the overall structure. This method can work with a wide variety of antigens and could lead to vaccines that are more effective for many pathogens. Advantages: -Does not modify protein structure -Works with many varieties of antigens -Uses adjuvant with excellent safety recordPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceutical industry-Vaccines"
Vitamin E Metabolites for Inflammatory Disease Treatment,"The immune system plays a central role in maintaining health and disease development, but excessive immune response leads to inflammation. Proinflammatory mediators play important roles in regulating inflammatory response. Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) play key roles in inflammatory responses; they are believed to be important in the development of degenerative disease as well.  Purdue University researchers have identified several vitamin E metabolites that act as potent inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2, resulting in decreased inflammation. In addition, these long-chain carboxychromanols inhibit 5-LOX.  Because these compounds inhibit the inflammation response through multiple pathways, they are useful anti-inflammatory agents and should have decreased side effects.  Targeting COX-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX will result in a more potent anti-inflammatory effect than current nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These compounds have potential use as effective cancer prevention and therapeutic agents, and in other chronic diseases, e.g., cardiovascular disease.   Advantages:-More potent anti-inflammatory effect-Decreased side effects-Other potential usesPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Cancer Treatment"
Potent Dimerization Inhibitors for HIV-1 Protease,"Advances in the treatment of HIV/AIDS with HIV-1 protease inhibitors in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), has resulted in improved life expectancy and significantly reduced HIV/AIDS-related mortality in the developed world.  Unfortunately, HAART suffers from adverse drug side effects, poor oral bioavailability, and drug interactions.  Also, drug-resistant HIV-1 variants have begun to emerge.  Development of antiretroviral therapy with broad-spectrum activity and minimal side effects is needed for current and future HIV/AIDS treatment.Purdue University researchers have created Darunavir, brand name Prezista, a drug used to treat HIV infection.

Cp-THF and Tp-THF-Based Novel Protease Inhibitors,"AIDS is an epidemic of global proportion; over 30 million people currently live with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Among many strategies to combat this disease, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with HIV protease inhibitors in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors continues to be the first-line treatment for control of HIV infection. This treatment regimen has definitely improved quality of life, enhanced HIV management, and halted the progression of the disease, and today, more people than ever before are living with HIV/AIDS. However, HIV is quick to develop resistance to new protease inhibitors. As a result, the pharmaceutical industry is continuously searching for new drugs to fight drug-resistant HIV. Darunavir is currently the industry gold standard and has shown the most efficacy in treating drug-resistant HIV strains. Researchers at Purdue University have designed a series of novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors for treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. These compounds have shown enzyme inhibitory activity and antiviral potency on par with Darunavir. Detailed virological studies suggest drug-resistance profiles with the potential to outperform Darunavir, positioning this promising class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors on deck in the fight against drug-resistant HIV.Advantages:-High enzyme inhibitory activity and antiviral potency-Exceptional drug-resistance profilePotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-HIV/AIDS Treatment"
Novel Ligands for HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors,"The AIDS epidemic is one of the most challenging problems in medicine in the 21st century. A retrovirus designated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a complex disease that includes progressive destruction of the immune system and degeneration of the central and peripheral nervous system.Among many strategies to combat this disease, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) continues to be the first-line treatment for control of HIV infection. This treatment regimen has definitely improved quality of life, enhanced HIV management, and halted the progression of the disease. Today, more people than ever before are living with HIV/AIDS thanks to this first-line treatment. However, despite the impressive success, there remain many challenges to treating this devastating disease, including decreasing both the toxicity and complexity of the treatment regimens. In addition, there is a growing population of patients that are developing multidrug-resistant strains of HIV, and there is ample evidence that these strains can be further transmitted. Purdue University researchers have designed and synthesized a novel class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors, which show potency 10x greater than that of Darunavir, an FDA-approved inhibitor developed by the same researchers. A number of these inhibitors are very potent against multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants and could lead to additional drugs used in HIV/AIDS treatment.Advantages: -HIV therapeutic with 10-fold potency increase over current standard-Effective for the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains of HIV Potential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-HIV/AIDS Treatment"

A Lab-on-Chip Platform for Measuring Real-time Nondestructive Extracellular Matrix Stiffness,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method of in vitro measurement of extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness that is nondestructive and provides fast readout. ECM stiffness has recently been found to be a contributing factor in cancer or fibrotic disease development including cell differentiation and rapid cell multiplication. Current technologies used to measure ECM stiffness in vitro are often invasive and expensive as well as sometimes limited to detecting cell destruction only after detrimental cell deformations have already occurred. The approach fine-tuned by Purdue researchers is includes a noninvasive on-chip platform that monitors ultrasonic wave attenuation thereby noninvasively characterizing ECM stiffness with up to 93% accuracy. The new low-cost sensors can continuously detect dynamic changes in vitro for up to two days while maintaining thermal stability. The highly selective, biocompatible sensors can also be implemented in applications including drug screening, drug discovery, and 3D cell cultures.   Advantages:-Low cost -Nondestructive -Accurate -Thermal Stability -Mechanical StabilityPotential Applications:-Biomedical -Research -3D Cell Cultures -Drug Screening -Therapeutic Efficacy Monitoring Recent Publication:  A Lab-on-Chip Ultrasonic Platform for Real-Time and Nondestructive Assessment of Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Royal Society of Chemistry's Lab on a Chip Journal  DOI: 10.1039/C9LC00926D"
Bone Fracture Repair by Targeting of Bone Anabolic Agents,"Current research on healing bone fractures either focuses on localized application of a nontargeted bone anabolic agent or a systematic administration of a nontargeted bone anabolic agent that have off-target effects. Both methods lack the desired efficiency and effectivity to treat bone fractures.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a targeted bone anabolic agent capable of accelerated fracture healing. By using a construct that self-assembles into micelles, the technology targets bone fractures to a greater extent than healthy bone, releases drug under physiological conditions, and accelerates fracture healing. This technology utilizes a nontoxic acidic oligopeptide that increases accumulation of the drug in fractures, reduces the accumulation in healthy tissue, and uses a cleavable linker to extend the release of the drug in the fracture site, resulting in faster fracture healing.Advantages-Nontoxic acidic oligopeptide increases accumulation of the drug in fractures and decreases drug accumulation in healthy tissue. Potential Applications:-Medical/Health-Orthopedics-Pharmaceuticals"
High Throughput Cancer Treatment Screening with Magnetic Actuation Platform,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a biomimetic platform using magnetic actuators for in vitro cell seeding. The setup is compatible with multi-well plates and allows for high throughput, thereby reducing the time needed to develop targeted cancer therapies. Cancer treatment screening typically involves use of a synthetic polymer-based substrate, which leads to undesired defects in cell cultures. These polymer substrates are controlled by electromechanical forces that do not accurately replicate natural cell environments. However, Purdue researchers have used magnetic actuators that are adaptable in both amplitude and frequency to apply specific strain that accurately suspends cells over a gap between actuators. In testing with 18,000 cells, within 24 hours a cell culture was ready to be studied. The system allows researchers and medical professionals to capture dynamic physiological conditions in 3D.Advantages:-Biomimetic-Enhanced cancer therapy-High throughputPotential Applications:-Cancer screening-Microbiology-Tissue engineering"
Pupillometer with Direct and Consensual Pupillary Reflex Measurement and Disease Classification,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new pupillometer for detecting sensory and motor function in the brain. The highly sensitive pupillometer can evaluate activity in the optic nerve and oculomotor nerve as well as conduct stem assessment. In addition, the device uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to compare results with a deep learning database to pinpoint lesions. Currently, pupillometers are only adapted to check one eye at a time, but often there can be damage to a consensual reflex that goes unnoticed. Purdue researchers have fine-tuned their pupillometer to feature a telecentric lens that enhances biodynamic image acquisition and thereby allows optometrists to obtain highly accurate measurements for reliable diagnostics. In addition, researchers integrate an invisible infrared light source instead of traditional visible light to prevent artifacts from appearing in one's vision.Advantages:-Accurate-Fast image acquisitionPotential Applications:-Optometry-Health Monitoring"
Silk-Based Textile Platforms of Semiconductor Photocatalysis Using Light Localization,"Strong light scattering in a partially heterogeneous medium is a primary means for efficient energy transport and a direct consequence of the constructive or destructive interference of lightwaves. Currently, roughly all experimental studies for realizing strong light scattering in the optical ranges use densely assembled nanostructures that rely on semiconductor material that has extremely high refractive-indices. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology that utilizes native silk fibers and cocoons produced by silkworms to make optical biomaterials for implantable optical devices and their components. Compared to current technology that is restricted by material toxicity and incompatibility, biomaterials using silk fibers and cocoons are more economical and eco-friendly. This new technology presents the possibility of countless applications, including scalable production, embedded devices, and biosensors. Advantages: -More economical and eco-friendly than current alternatives -Not restricted by material toxicity or biocompatibility Potential Applications: -Biocompatible optical components -Implantable optical devices"
Architecture and Information Based Neural Network,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed new neural networks (NN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for artificial intelligence (AI) that can be used to process images with high efficiency. The neural networking technique utilizes information typically ignored in AI, including optically analyzing single molecules directly from image content. Currently, deep neural networks (DNN) are used to measure single molecules by rotating a double helix point spread function (PSF) or implementing Gaussian models, which requires complex mapping to connect input with output, and depends on domain expertise. The Purdue University approach instead relies on a network architecture that recognizes inherent information from images at a rate of one million PSFs for each task. In addition, this technology can accurately distinguish one hundred to three hundred sub-regions on average, which is equivalent to twenty to sixty raw data frames. Key features of a single molecule such as location, orientation, and wave-front distortion can now be obtained with ease. This enhanced decoupling technique allows researchers to process biological images faster than ever before.Advantages:-Measures at single molecule level -Enhanced imaging -Easy storage and interpretation of imagesPotential Applications:-Biomedical research-Biological image processing-Artificial Intelligence"
"Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) Blends for Self-powered, Wearable Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs) Suitable for Cardiovascular Monitoring","Researchers at Purdue University have developed self-powered wearable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based contact layers for monitoring cardiovascular health. Cardiovascular health is typically measured by echocardiogram (ECG) to measure electrical activity in the heart or photoplethysmography (PPG) that measures changes in blood volume in the peripheral microvasculature; however, these technologies can often be invasive to patients and have not yet been adapted into wearables for personalized on-demand monitoring. TENGs with PVA blend contact layers produce fast readout with distinct peaks for blood ejection, blood reflection in the lower body, and blood rejection from the closed aortic valve, which may enable detection of common cardiovascular diseases such as cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, and ischemic heart disease. In addition, PVA has some unique advantages over other materials used in TENGS such as starch, chitosan, lignin, or polyamides because it is biocompatible, water-soluble, and costs three to four times less on average. Purdue researchers have characterized optimal compositions of PVA on gelatin composite films using proton and carbon NMR to verify molecular structure, dynamic light scattering (DLS) to test coil size reduction and select the best percent by weight of PVA, and finally analyzing dielectric constants of various blends to enhance their energy harvesting capability. In testing with a copper-based band worn on the wrist, these devices show accuracy in measuring the average human pulse as 76 beats per minute. This holistic engineering approach to health monitoring can be implemented for therapeutic and diagnostic applications as well as a myriad of electronics including touch screens, virtual reality, and robotics.Advantages:-Reliable-Accurate-Wearable-Self-Powering-Small-Mechanically Deformable-Biocompatible-Personalized-On-demandPotential Applications:-Biomedical Engineering-Touch Screens-HMI-Robotics"
Electrochemical Detection Device for COVID-19 in Saliva,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a wireless biosensor that contains DNA primers for nCOVID-19 in order to rapidly and non-invasively test for the virus in patient saliva. Current technology for nCOVID-19 testing is often invasive, is not efficient, or involves testing for antibody activity rather than viral strands. The platform created by Purdue researchers features an inkjet-printed gold electrode that allows for communication with a software application so that electronic readout can be conducted on-site. The electrochemical device has been evaluated in-lab at Purdue University with a library of nCOVID-19 DNA primers to achieve distinction between nCOVID-19, the flu, and other viruses for enhanced detection.Advantages:-Rapid -On-site -Accurate -WirelessPotential Applications:-Biomedical -Sensors"
Generation of Hematopoietic Stem Cells from In Vitro Origin,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new means to efficiently generate hematopoietic stem cells for use in blood diseases, cancer therapy and regenerative medicine. Humans generate specific red and white blood cell types from a common precursor, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). HSC transplantation is an important therapeutic option for many blood diseases, cancers and immunodeficiencies, replacing diseased blood cell populations. However, HSCs are currently in short supply as they are typically extracted from humans. The Purdue University researchers have responded to this need by developing a serum-free, in vitro directed differentiation protocol to generate human HSCs from pluripotent stem cells. These HSCs have been proven capable of generating white and red blood cell progeny. In further validation of this technology, the HSCs implanted into zebrafish embryos colonized the hematopotietic tissues of the growing chimeric fish. Altogether, this technology provides a needed step towards production of HSCs to treat patients suffering from blood diseases, cancer and immunodeficient conditions.Advantages:-Increased HSC production-No human blood or serum needed-Cost-effective and reproduciblePotential Applications-Biomanufacturing-Cell Therapy-Cancer Treatment-Regenerative Medicine"
Strain Gauge Integrated Magnetic Microactuator for Smart Self-Clearing Catheter,"Hydrocephalus is a neurological disease characterized by an excessive accumulation of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain. Treatment requires the implantation of shunts through which CSF can be drained from the brain.  However, the failure rate of these systems remain high, especially among children. According to the Journal of Neurosurgery, a study conducted from April 2008 to December 2011 reported that 33% out of 1036 patients experienced shunt failure. Common causes of failure include obstruction, over-drainage, and loculated ventricles.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an implantable catheter capable of obstruction detection and removal, device alignment, and flow rate measurement. Previously, Purdue researchers introduced a fully integrated self-clearing implantable catheter that was able to clear obstructions, but found that once the device was implanted it was impossible to determine whether the device was oriented properly or actuating as expected. With new additions, in real-time the catheter can detect obstructions, confirm device alignment, and measure the CSF flow-rate on top of the existing biofouling-removal capabilities of the microactuator in the catheter. This device has demonstrated the ability to solve one of the largest challenges that clinicians encounter with chronically implanted catheters. Advantages:-Obstruction Detection-Device Alignment-Flow Rate Measurement-Self-Clearing-Ease of FabricationPotential Applications: -Hydrocephalus Treatment"
Optical Detection Of Neurological Alterations,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new non-invasive technology to detect neurological alterations caused by disease and/or injury. The current Pupillary light reflex (PLR) tests are conducted by pen light exam, which tends to be heuristic, empirical, qualitative often leading to misdiagnosis due to human error. Even though there are some quantitative pupillometry devices that are available in the market, it is often associated with high startup cost and a work accurately under a narrow range of conditions. This PLR technology developed at Purdue uses elegant mathematical modeling to detect neurological alterations. It is compatible with any imaging platform and eye color. It delivers automated, accurate, objective measurements in real-time.Advantages:-Portable- Easy to use-Accurate- AutomatedPotential Applications:-Monitor neurological alterations due to disease and/or injury"
Adaptable Respiratory Rate Monitoring for Commercial Fitness Devices ,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed new signal processing techniques for measuring respiratory rates. Through algorithms that measure inhale and exhale frequency of patients as well as heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) can be determined. Unlike current technologies, this algorithm can be integrated into existing commercial fitness devices. The low-power, portable technology can also be implemented into Kangaroo Mother Care pouches for use in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). The system is found to operate at a rate between seven and thirteen breaths per minute, and showed improved modeling compared to other similar algorithms. The measures of baseline drift as well as QRS complex height for ventricle hypertrophy were enhanced by using the Purdue University approach. Advantages:-Low Power -Portable -Adaptable with existing devices -Accurate Potential Applications:-Fitness -Neonatal Care -Hospitals -Medical"
Adjustable Hearing Aid with Frequency Compression for Clear Speech Perception,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed an algorithm that establishes parameters for audio signals in hearing aids based on a patient's severity of hearing loss. The ability to distinguish between high and low frequencies allows for faster user response, easing every day conversations as well as patient lifestyles. Hearing aids have been adapted to lower frequency through Hybrid Expansive Frequency Compression (hEFC) methods; however, hEFC technology often confuses between high and low frequencies. In addition, hEFC based systems cannot filter background noise and rarely recognize soft sounds like frication. Often, individuals with high frequency hearing loss will start to rely on memory of sounds, which leads to misidentification of phonemes. Purdue University has integrated new technology into hearing aids that keeps different sounds separate and enhances fricatives, affricates, and stop constant barriers. Advantages:-Faster signal time-Eliminates need for frequency remapping -Identifies spectral prominence of sound Potential Applications:-Hearing aids -Assistive biotechnology"
Method of Thin Flexible Electrode Insertion for Deep Brain Neural Recording and the Design of Electrode Insertion Device,"Inserting a device to record deep brain activity is not a new technology.  However, the current technology is not as efficient as it could be.  Some of the problems with the current technology include leaving a flexible electrode behind after completion of the recording, coating with biodegradable materials to increase stiffness, and using a magnetic field to obtain necessary energy to penetrate the brain.  All of these issues are very invasive to the brain that is being recorded and could potentially cause health issues for the individual.  There is a need for a less invasive way to record deep brain activity.  Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that allows for less invasive recording of deep brain activity.  This new technology allows for insertion of 25 um platinum electrode in the deep brain.  This electrode does not need any supporting tube, cannula, or biodegradable material to assist it in the recording of the deep brain.  This means it is much less invasive and cause minimal neuronal damage.  This new technology could open the door for recording deep brain activity. Advantages: -No support needed-Less invasive-Causes minimal neuronal damage Potential Applications: -Neurological studies-Brain surgery"
Si Nanoneedles with Flexible Bio-Substrates for Efficient Bio-Integrations ,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed Si nanoneedles fabricated with various kinds of mechanically flexible bio-related substrates, providing flexibility, stretchability, and biodegradability. The transparent, ultrathin nanoneedles serve as an ideal platform for minimally invasive penetration into biological cells. This technology would help researchers or instructors who want to image, probe, and/or deliver molecules into/from biological systems for measuring important electrical and/or mechanical properties.Advantages: -Flexible/stretchable-Minimally invasive-BiodegradablePotential Applications: -Imaging-Probing-Molecule transfer"
"Efficient, Wearable Body Heating and Cooling System","Researchers at Purdue University have developed an efficient thermoelectric, wearable body heating and cooling system device. Whereas an electric heater only allows for heating, this thermoelectric heat pump provides hot and cold therapy with a higher efficiency. Furthermore, the thermoelectric generator can be operated by rechargeable battery(s) and can be used over several hours. Additionally, this technology can be used in a jacket or a vest in extreme weather conditions by soldiers, first responders, and others working outdoors.Advantages:-Wearable -Efficient -Battery operatedPotential Applications:-Sports and Sports Medicine -Military Thermal Wear-Cold Therapy-Pain Reliever -Vascular Enhancement"
MRSA Elimination,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a staph infection resistant to many antibiotics used to treat typical staph infections. According to Mayo Clinic Staff, there are two common types of MRSA: healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) and community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA). HA-MRSA tends to be the result of invasive procedures, e.g. device implantation. The latter, CA-MRSA, is spread through skin-to-skin contact, typically beginning as a painful boil. In addition, MRSA is considered to be even more life-threatening if combined with sepsis or necrotizing pneumonia. Because MRSA is drug-resistant, there is need for a method of prevention and elimination of the infection. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a drug-free approach to eliminating MRSA. Using blue-light bleaching, along with hydrogen peroxide, have shown to eliminate a MRSA culture and a MRSA infection of a mouse wound. This has shown to be a safe and effective method of eliminating MRSA.  Advantages: -Safe -Effective-Drug-free approachPotential Applications: -MRSA prevention-MRSA treatment"
Methods and Systems for Making Customizable Soft Sensor with Real-time Contact and Stretching Sensing for Instant Interactions,"Recent developments in soft sensors have shown their capability for complex sensing with high flexibility and stretchability. Unfortunately, current materials and fabrication processes are expensive and complex. There currently exist the need for a more efficient fabrication process of soft sensors for adding touch interactions to physical objects and the human body. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a single volume sensor capable of sensing real-time continuous contact and stretching.

High-performance Platinum Neurostimulation Electrode with 97% Reduction in Corrosion,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed neurostimulation microelectrodes that solve the current concerns of safety and reliability, while still maintaining high performance. Platinum (Pt) is one of the most commonly used materials for neurostimulation devices due to its excellent biocompatibility and good charge transfer characteristics. Although Pt is regarded as safe, it commonly goes through irreversible electrochemical corrosion during neurostimulation which leaves cytotoxic byproducts. To combat these issues, Purdue Researchers micro-fabricated graphene-coated Pt microelectrodes with circular and fractal designs to show that graphene can significantly suppress Pt corrosion while maintaining excellent performance. In fact, over a 10 hour testing time, the graphene layer reduced Pt corrosion by 97 percent for fractal microelectrodes and 88 percent for circular microelectrodes all while retaining superior charge transfer characteristics.  Advantages: -Decreased Corrosion-Safe-Reliable	 Potential Applications: -Neurostimulation devices"
Instrumented Flexible Tissue Scaffolds Allowing for Real-time Monitoring of Engineered Tissues and Cells,"The continually growing engineered tissue market focusses on working to repair tissues or cells damaged by some of the world's most debilitating cancers and diseases. One major challenge in this field is monitoring and continuously testing performance of engineered tissues and cells used to replace damaged ones. Researchers at Purdue University have developed flexible tissue scaffolds that allow for real-time, long-term monitoring of engineered tissues and cells. This technology is a tissue scaffold with sensor arrays in a stackable design that can monitor electrophysiological activities of cells and tissues. Furthermore, the information provided by these scaffolds is made into 3D maps to track activity. Through usage of an ultra-buoyant scaffold design, the entire structure remains afloat on the cell culture medium, providing complete isolation of the electronic instrument from the wet conditions inside the body.Advantages: 	-Real-time, long-term monitoring-3D mapping capabilitiesPotential Applications: -Engineered tissues and cells-Drug screening-Tissue development"
"Breathable, Paper-based Epidermal Electronics","Current manufacturing methods and materials for epidermal electronics are complex and expensive, which prevent their adoption as single-use medical devices. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a low-cost, omniphobic, paper-based wearable or implantable epidermal electronic to monitor health status. Whereas current metallic based skin-mountable or implantable devices are not breathable and short-circuit in high humidity situations, this porous, paper-based technology is not impacted by moisture changes and is highly breathable. Furthermore, this technology makes epidermal electronic devices accessible to high-throughput manufacturing technologies to allow the fabrication of a variety of wearable medical devices at a low cost. Advantages:-Breathable-Not impacted by moisture-Low-costPotential Applications:-Wearable or implantable epidermal electronics"
Wearable & Stretchable Electromagnetically-Coupled Radiofrequency Probes,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is inherently a low-sensitivity technique, and there is a desire to boost signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a leading factor in determining image quality. Current approaches to enhancing SNR include shaping receive coil arrays to encompass a generalized form of the anatomy of interest, but these are often rigid and require the patient be posed in a specific way. A flexible and stretchable coil which could be placed close to the skin on an area or joint regardless of its positioning would be immensely beneficial to both quality of MRI results and patient comfort. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an adaptable, wearable, and stretchable fabric embroidered with conductive threads that provides excellent SNR for enhanced MRI imaging. The fabricated coil presents multi-directional stretchability and flexibility while maintaining conductivity and stitch integrity. Quality factor measurements and SNR calculations show that this technology is comparable to current state of the art in SNR results, however, this technology has the added benefits of adaptability and stretchability. Advantages:-Adaptable -Stretchable-Enhanced signal receptionPotential Applications:-MRI"
Portable Multiplexing Bioassay for Analyte Detection,"Rapid detection of biological and chemical hazards is of upmost importance to USDA, EPA, and DoD. Likewise, companies within the food and life sciences industry are constantly concerned with contaminant detection in products. The current standard for detecting biological analytes is by the CyTOF method. In this method, samples are collected, then mixed with metal conjugated antibodies, and finally loaded into a mass cytometer. Once inside the cytometer, the metal ionizes which allows the analyte-metal conjugated antibody complex to be detected. Whilst, this system is great at detecting multiple analytes, it has several disadvantages including: samples requiring time-consuming extensive preparation and the use of the cytometer, which is a large device costing $700,000. This has created an unfulfilled need for a portable system that can quickly analyze the contents of a sample.Researchers at Purdue have developed an instrument that can rapidly detect 15 or more analytes in a sample at once. This instrument is a similar to CyTOF in that metal conjugated antibodies are used to detect analytes. In contrast, samples are loaded into an absorbent strip with no sample preparation needed. The strips are then exposed to a laser and results are available within 15 minutes of loading the sample.  The major differentiator of this instrument to CyTOF is that it is 5 percent of the cost.Advantages: -Detect multiple analytes at once-Rapid and portable-InexpensivePotential Applications: -Hazard detection-Environmental sample analysis"
Contamination Mitigation and Runtime System for Programmable Lab on a Chip,"Microfluidic lab on a chip (LoC) devices are used in medicine, chemistry, and biological sciences to test laboratory samples at the microscopic level. These chips require specific programming instructions for every experiment. It can be time consuming and expensive to construct instruction sets for every new chip design. Fluid contamination is also a factor that must be minimized. Purdue University researchers have developed a new runtime system for programmable lab on a chip devices that also incorporates contamination mitigation. Their approach allows the runtime system to work like an assembler in a personal computer, translating from a programming language to a set of requests for the chip. Included in this system are instructions to prevent contamination in various types of LoCs.Advantages:- Less time spent writing instruction sets- Works with many types of LoC devices- Instruction sets for contamination mitigation"
Prediction of swelling and pasting behavior of starch solutions,"Starches are used in a variety of food products but their swelling and pasting properties have not been well characterized. The prediction of starch properties would enable the fine-tuning of food textures. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a mathematical model for the swelling of starch granules when heated. This model was used to characterize the texture of starches such as maize, rice, and potato and predicted the texture for starches under different processing conditions. The application for this technology include in the optimization of food textures such as in canned soups, gravies, and baby foods, as well as adjustment of non-food products such as paper coatings and paints.Advantages:-Prediction and optimization of starch propertiesPotential Applications: -Food products-Paper coatings and paint"
Inexpensive Disposable Smart Bandages,"It was reported by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research that chronic wounds account for $28 to $32 billion of US Medicare healthcare expenditures. The high cost can be attributed to several factors such as costs associated with multiple doctor visits and bacterial infection prevention.  Smart bandages have been developed to lower wound care costs by wirelessly monitoring and preventing wound infection.  Unfortunately, conventional smart bandages are expensive, uncomfortable, and do not promote healing.  Moreover, these bandages require trained personnel to apply and interpret the results from smart bandages. Therefore, there is a need for smart bandages that are patient-friendly and promote wound healing.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a smart bandage, OPSB, that can assess tissue damage in open and closed wounds, promote healing through its breathable design, and doesn't require medical personnel for application. OPSB real-time monitors uric acid and pH at the wound site and wirelessly communicates this information to physicians; thereby, reducing the number of visits to the doctor. OPSB can also detect and monitor pressure ulcers.Advantages: -	Wireless wound healing monitor-	Inexpensive-	DisposablePotential Applications: -	Wound care-	Pressure ulcer detection"
Ultrasensitive Biosensor,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a biosensor that can detect ultralow concentrations of biomolecules. The biosensor successfully detected glucose and dopamine and could be used to detect other molecules which are difficult to detect using conventional methods. This biosensor detects biomolecules that release protons during enzymatic reactions unlike commercially available devices which rely on electron detection. The biosensor also has the capability to detect different biomolecules simultaneously. Dopamine and glucose were detected in water with a limit of detection of 50 and 500 attomolar concentration respectively. The biosensor is compact and can easily be integrated into wearable and implantable devices.Advantages: -Low limit of detection of biomolecules:-100 million times more sensitive than conventional glucose monitor-10,000x more sensitive than glucose transistor device-10x more sensitive than glucose electrochemical sensor-Capable of being integrated in implantable and wearable devices:-Compact size-Does not require external energy input-Works at room temperaturePotential Applications: -Glucose sensors-Biomolecule sensorsRelated Publication:Perovskite nickelates as bio-electronic interfacesNature Communications 10, Article number: 1651 (2019)DOI: 10.1038/s41467-019-09660-6"
Wearable High-Dielectric-Constant Polymers with Core-shell Liquid Metal Inclusions for Biomechanical Energy Harvesting and Self-powered User Interface,"Deformable energy devices capable of efficiently scavenging mechanical signals enable the promise of self-powered micro-/nano-systems. An assortment of technologies has been developed to transform the otherwise wasted ambient mechanical energy into electrical power through mechanisms such as electrostatic, piezoelectric, and recently, triboelectric processes. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) could efficiently harvest mechanical energy for power electronics and sensors. The secondary-phase additive materials used for dielectric engineering in TENGS are exclusively solid type with limited deformability. The rigid nature of these materials result in issues such as undesirable stress concentrations and layer delamination, leading to deteriorated bulk deformability and long-term durability.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a wearable high-dielectric-constant polymer with core-shell liquid metal inclusions for biomechanical energy harvesting and self-powered user interface. The liquid-metal-inclusion based TENG (LMI-TENG) consists of a layer of liquid metal embedded functional silicone sandwiched between two Ecoflex layers. Compared to LMI-TENG devices with 0 wt% liquid metal particles (LMP), the output performance of LMI-TENG with 50 wt% LMP is boosted with an enhancement of 300%. Experimentation has demonstrated potential application in human-integrated technology. LMI-TENG enables the high performance of TENGs with more desirable deformability. Advantages: -Increased deformability-Good sensitivity in low pressure regionPotential Applications: -Wearable electronics"
Higher Binding Strength of Surgical Sealant,"In a report published by MedMarket Diligence LLC in 2017, the United States accounts for 30% of the 114 million surgical wounds that occur every year worldwide. The traditional method of closing surgical incisions are staples and sutures. The major disadvantages of staples and sutures are pain, infection, and added trips to doctor to remove them. Medical professionals have an increasing interest in ways to decrease the risk of infection and eliminate the damage of healthy tissue near the surgical site. Surgical sealants are a promising technology that could hold incisions closed without mechanical support of sutures or staples. There are a few commercially available surgical sealants. Commercially available surgical sealants have poor elasticity and adhesive strength and, therefore, require mechanical support. A strong and elastic surgical sealant would not require additional support. A first generation sealant have addressed the elasticity problem with the development of their first generation surgical sealant.Recently, researchers at Purdue University have modified their their first generation surgical sealant to improve its adhesive strength. The adhesive strength was higher for the second generation in comparison to the first generation surgical sealant on pig skin at physiological conditions. The adhesive strength was also measured on aluminum and it was found that second generation was 130% stronger than first generation adhesive and 14,000% stronger than Tisseel (commercially available surgical sealant from Baxter). Advantages: -Decreased risk of incision infection-Decreased pain and scarring at surgical sites-High adhesive strength and elasticityPotential Applications: -Closing surgical incisions"
High Sensitivity Glutamate Biosensor,"Glutamate excitotoxicity (GE) is a dynamic process by which neurons are damaged due to excessive amount of glutamate in the cell. It is hypothesized by scientists that glutamate excitotoxicity is a secondary injury that can occur after spinal cord injury (SCI). The limited knowledge of the role of glutamate in secondary injury has limited the development of therapeutics for GE. In 2016, the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center reported 300,000 people currently live with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States. SCI is a debilitating illness that often leaves patients with limited mobility. The lifetime healthcare cost per patient can range from $1,200,000 to $5,000,000 per patient. Current bioanalytical techniques such as nuclear resonance imaging have low spatiotemporal resolution and poor sensitivity for determining glutamate levels. Since glutamate excitotoxicity is dynamic in nature and can progress over time, it is crucial that the glutamate diagnostic tools possess high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity of glutamate.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a biosensor with superior sensitivity for measuring glutamate levels in hopes to better understand GE. In in vitro studies, it was found that the newly developed biosensor exhibited 6 times higher glutamate sensitivity in comparison to glutamate biosensors fabricated in other labs. The biosensor had high selectivity for glutamate with a detection limit 14 µM. Advantages: -	Superior sensitivity for glutamate-	High selectivity for glutamate-	Simplify process of measuring glutamatePotential Applications: -	Glutamate biosensor"
Rapid Method for Determining Antibiotic Susceptibility in Bacteria,"Antibiotic resistant bacteria have been drastically increasing in number due to the widespread use of antibiotics, becoming a growing public threat. To combat infections it is essential to detect bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics in the early stages of infection to reduce undesirable use of antibiotics.  Current methods for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) require 16 hours at a minimum to complete, can only analyze specific bacteria, among other limitations. Therefore, a rapid method for detecting bacteria and profiling their antibiotics response is needed for infectious disease treatment.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a metabolic imaging method to monitor activity in live bacteria. This system incorporates a culture-free environment and can determine antibiotic susceptibility of general bacteria within nearly one cell cycle by monitoring metabolic activity at the single cell level. AST time required using this method is reduced from at least 16 hours for conventional culture based systems to around 30 minutes. AST at the single bacterium level is especially useful for nonculturable or fastidious bacteria; metabolic activity happens faster than phenotypic growth, meaning that antibiotic susceptibility can be determined before the bacteria has the chance to replicate. This system would likely be used in laboratories and hospitals to assign the correct antibiotics to fight infections.   Advantages: -Greatly reduced testing time-AST before replication-Culture-free		 Potential Applications: -Laboratories-Hospitals"
Evaluate Glucose Concentrations Using a Selective Condenser for Collection of Exhaled Breath Condensate,"While self-monitoring of blood glucose is critical to properly controlling diabetes, 67% of patients fail to monitor their glucose levels due to the inconvenience of collecting finger-prick blood samples. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a promising non-invasive sample for glucose monitoring purposes due to its highly controlled physiological regulation. However, this may reduce reliability because the concentration of glucose is diluted by additional water vapor and the inclusion of anatomical dead space air, causing a wide range of reported EBC glucose concentrations.  By selectively collecting only exhaled breath that has been exchanged with lung fluid, it is anticipated that a greater fraction of glucose can be collected in the condensate.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an automated and selective exhaled breath condenser for glucose monitoring. This is the first condenser of its kind to actually separate and exclude dead space air from lung fluid-exchanged air. The condensate collected from this device provides a robust sample for evaluating glucose concentrations without variable dilution factors from dead space condensate that could impact the reliability of the sample.Advantages: -Separates/excludes dead space air from lung fluid-exchanged air-Provides robust sample for glucose concentration evaluation-Improves reliability of glucose samplesPotential Applications: -Glucose monitoring-Glycemic control-Diabetes treatment"
Intravascular Photoacoustic Tomography Assessment of Lipid Content in Arteries,"Photoacoustic imaging is a biomedical imaging modality based on the use of laser-generated ultrasound.  This technology has been improving for the last ten years.  Currently, other types of imaging like x-ray angiography or OCT have some problems including insufficient resolution or does not have enough depth or chemical information.  There is a need for a new technology that can improve photoacoustic imaging and make it a better solution than current imaging technologies. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that is a catheter-based intravascular imaging in the presence of luminal blood.  This technology allows doctors or preclinical researchers to get information about lipid deposit in arterial wall in vivo.  It does this by accurately and reliably assess the vulnerability of the artery.  This technology could greatly improve artery assessment by photoacoustic imaging in the future. Advantages: -Accurate assessment of artery-Reliable assessment of arteryPotential Applications: -Artery assessment-Photoacoustic imaging"
Wearable Health Monitoring Using Human Body Communication,"The evolution of computing has led to widespread growth of wearable smart devices (fitness trackers, smartphones, apple watch, pressure sensors, etc.); the signals communicating with each other on the person form a network known as Body Area Network (BAN) or Human-Internet, and are typically connected via Bluetooth. However, Human Body Communication (HBC) has recently emerged as an energy-efficient and secure alternative that uses the human body as a communication medium. While there is a usable network encompassing a single person, there was no method for expanding this personalized network any further until researchers at Purdue University developed a secure human-internet device using dynamic human communication. The wearable device is capable of communicating human-human or human-machine interactions to create dynamic HBC channels for information exchange during actions like handshaking, subsequently expanding the network to usable Human-Internet. Beyond this, there is need of more applications regarding Human-Internet.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a wearable hub for health monitoring using HBC. The health monitoring device and system are built using Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) sensors and components that provide reliable connectivity; superior energy efficiency (more than 8X) over Bluetooth; and significant power efficiency, showing its advantage over the wireless system. This technology collects data from physiological sensors and transmits it through hubs worn on the body. In addition, data can be uploaded via hubs through human-machine interaction, i.e. Human-Internet, to an HBC capable machine. Advantages: -Energy efficient-Dynamic-Secure-Reliable connectionPotential Applications: -Human intranet/internet-Information exchange-Health monitoring"
Acid Reflux Induced Laryngospasm as a Potential Mechanism of Sudden Death in Epilepsy,"There is growing evidence that laryngospasm may be linked to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). There are an estimated 3.4 million Americans, including 470,000 children, living with epilepsy. Approximately 30% of seizures cannot be controlled by medication, and uncontrolled seizures are the primary risk factor for SUDEP. The exact cause of SUDEP is unknown, but laryngospasm has been proposed as a potential cause; therefore, there is a need for research to explore the causes of laryngospasm. Researchers at Purdue University have developed research into the causes of laryngospasms and its link with epilepsy. This research confirmed that sudden death due to laryngospasm in the kainic acid model of epilepsy is always preceded by a certain mechanism, and a method to eliminate sudden death has also been developed. This knowledge may inform future research into sudden death epilepsy and may contribute to the hypothesis that has been presented. This mechanism may be important in other mechanisms of sudden death.Advantages: -Elimination of SUDEP-Inform future research-Important for other mechanisms of sudden deathPotential Applications: -SUDEP-Layngospasm"
Self-Clearing Glaucoma Drainage Device,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in the world. The eye disorder has no cure, and can only be treated via pharmaceutical or surgical intervention with varying degrees of success. Implantable glaucoma drainage devices have grown in popularity over the past years, but the reliability of these implants is poor; only about 50% of the devices are still operational after five years. The lack of reliability is generally due to accumulation of microorganisms during and after implantation.Researchers at Purdue University have invented a new glaucoma drainage device that combats the problem of biofouling. Using new advancements in technology, the device is ""Smart,"" and is able to clear itself of harmful bio-buildup. It is also able to functionally manage intraocular pressure (IOP) due to the variable flow resistance of glaucoma drainage device (GDD). These improvements allow for a more reliable, yet safe and comfortable implant for treating glaucoma.Advantages:-Self-clearing-Control of IOP pressuresPotential Applications:-Glaucoma treatment"
Novel Gene Delivery Method,"In the current versions of bovine adenoviral vector system, only .6 kb deletion of the E1 region can be made in the bovine cell line.  Various versions of less prevalent human adenoviral vectors are tested for gene delivery and vaccine production.  The problem with these current versions is that they do not provide the best immune responses.  They are also not as efficient as they could be.  There is a need for a new technology that allows for better responses and increases the efficiency of adenoviral vector mediated gene delivery.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that supports the replication of bovine adenoviral vector with full E1 region deleted.  This allows foreign gene cassette capacity in the bovine adenoviral vector to be extended by 2kb.  Such deletion would allow for a much greater insert capacity of the foreign gene cassette containing one or more genes.  This new technology could potentially open the door for many new technologies pertaining to adenoviral vector mediated gene delivery and vaccine production.Advantages: -Provides better responses-More efficientPotential Applications: -Gene delivery-Adenoviral vectors-Gene therapy"
Multiscale Microdevices for Antifouling Sensing and Drug Delivery,"Microscale sensors and drug delivery devices often suffer from functional degradation due to biofouling. Biofouling is one of the most recognized challenges in developing chronically functional devices for marine and implantable applications. This problem has been addressed by the use of coating; however, coatings lose functionality over time. Other passive antifouling mechanisms are often toxic, short-term solutions. A more reliable and long-lasting solution might improve the reliability and performance of implantable sensors and drug delivery devices.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an antifouling solution for large, nonplanar optical surfaces. This technology is a device for marine or implantable applications that has nested multiscale features for active and passive anti-biofouling strategies. By combining active and passive anti-biofouling mechanisms, this device will provide long-term protection against biofouling for over 10 years, extending the lifetime of self-clearing marine or implantable sensors.Advantages: -Remove protein, bacteria, and cellular-level biofilms-Extend lifetime of self-clearing marine/implantable sensors-Insights on progression of various chronic diseasesPotential Applications: -Marine/implantable sensors-Neural interfaces-Inflammation, restoration, and therapeutics"
Martina: A Breastfeeding Simulation System,"Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce diabetes, obesity, and respiratory infections.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that mother's breastfeed their babies for six months.  Today, only 11.9 percent of babies are breastfed for this long. The main reason for this is mothers feel discomfort during breastfeeding.  Sore breasts and bleeding nipples are causing mothers to stop breastfeeding early and use formula.  Using formula is also a financial burden.  By breastfeeding, families could save $1200 to $1500 over the six month period.  There is a need for a way for mothers to properly learn how to breastfeed.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that can teach mothers the correct technique of breastfeeding to avoid the discomfort.  This technology is a breastfeeding simulation that gives mothers a realistic training session on the proper techniques of it.  It can teach them the proper way to hold the baby, proper orientation in which the baby should be held, and other important aspects that will reduce the discomfort to the nursing mother.  This simulation is hands on, providing a realistic baby and breast prosthetic for the mothers to practice using.  This system gives feedback, allowing the mother to adjust her technique until she gets it correct.  This technology could change how mothers approach breastfeeding. Advantages: -Hands-on training-Realistic simulation-Teaches correct technique Potential Applications: -Breastfeeding-Nursing mothers"
Pulse Parameter Modulation for Neural Cell Stimulation,"Electrical stimulation has been used for over two centuries to modulate the activity of various human physiological systems, especially the nervous system. An electrical pulse, typically in a square wave, is applied to the tissue to activate neural cells in the region. This type of stimulation is effective at achieving good neural stimulation but the system experiences a high type of resistance called impedance at the electrodes, increasing the power requirements and introducing more noise into the system.Purdue University researchers have developed a novel method of designing stimulus waveforms called Pulse Parameter Modulation (PPM). By pulsing the electric signal at the right rate the neurons respond the same way as they would to a continuous pulse with less impedance. This means that less power is needed to achieve the same effects, which will increase the lifespan of battery-powered implants and allows smaller stimulation electrodes with higher spacial locality. The pulsing can also be utilized to more selectively activate certain neuron populations (i.e. A, B, or C fibers) based on their activation levels and time constants."
Bioactive Glass-Polymer Bone Regeneration,"A broken bone unable to heal on its own is considered to have experienced a critical size defect; 5 to 10 percent of breaks fall into this category. The use of one's own bone tissue is currently the best available option, except it requires two surgeries, the material available is limited, and there is a risk of donor-site morbidity. The other option is to use bone tissue from a donor or a cadaver; these offer more material, but there is a risk of disease transmission, reduction of osteoinductive properties, and lack of osteogenic cellular components. In addition, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are sometimes used to improve osteoinductivity, but these proteins have a short half-life and must be added in supraphysiological doses. Without BMPs, there is a risk of ectopic bone formation. There is a need for a safer, more beneficial approach to bone regeneration.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology for healing bone defects using bioactive silicate glass (BSG) and a 3D osteomimetic composite porous scaffold containing microspheres comprised of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). Unlike other bioactive glasses which increase local pH, this demonstrates fast dissolution and ion release without impacting local pH; in addition, this BSG also contains higher calcium and phosphorous content. The beneficial mechanical properties of PLGA are combined with the bioactivity of the BSG, introducing the possibility of BSGs replacing autografts, allografts, and BMPs.Advantages: -Requires fewer surgeries-Displays minimal risk for disease transmission-Retains the osteoinductive properties-Retains the osteoinductive cellular components-Eliminates the need for BMPsPotential Applications: -Bone regeneration-Fixing critical size bone defects-Elimination of ectopic bone formation"
DNA-Guided Gene Editing Tools,Gene editing has been a much sought after and very controversial technology.  Clustered Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is the current widely known gene editing technology.  The problem with this current technology is it restricted to targeting regions adjacent to a specific motif.  Another issue with CRISPR is that it can cause mutations throughout the genome.  This problem accounts for one of the reasons that gene editing is such a controversial topic.  There is a need for a new gene editing technology that could potentially solve these controversial issues.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology pertaining to gene editing.  This new method consists of Argonaute from Natronbacterium gregoryi or its mutants that target the enzyme to cleave specific regions of a chromosome or other extra chromosomal genetic material.  The DNA guides are designed as 24 nucleotides complementary to a gene of interest.  This technology reduces random cleavage and may be used for targeting gene editing.  This new technology could open the door for how gene editing is approached in the future. Advantages: -More flexible-Not restricted to certain regionsPotential Applications: -Gene editing-Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes
Implantable Single-Use Drug Delivery Device for Opioid Overdose,"According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, over 569,000 people died from drug overdose between 1999 and 2015, of which over 216,000 people died from prescription opioid overdose. An FDA approved anti-overdose drug, naloxone, counteracts the action of opioids. Although naloxone's availability has improved in recent years with legislation allowing for over-the-counter purchase of the drug, patients often are incapacitated and unable to administer the potential life-saving drug on themselves in a timely manner. There is a need for a single-use anti-overdose drug delivery method that allows drug users to administer an antidote to combat the effects of an overdose. Researchers from Purdue University have developed an implantable drug delivery device that injects a single dose of naloxone or another anti-opioid overdose drug. The device will inject under the skin of at-risk patients of opioid misuse and activate upon detection of an overdose event. When an overdose occurs, the body reacts with a sudden increase in temperatures and other abrupt changes to normal body function. Such sudden changes trigger the implanted device, allowing the anti-opioid overdose drug to diffuse the overdose before lethal effects occur. The device will facilitate delivery of the antidote for caretakers or emergency responders. In future iterations, incorporating feedback control allows for the automatic release of the antidote upon overdose detection. Advantages:-Facilitates delivery of antidote-Eliminates overdose-Wireless-ImplantablePotential Applications:-People at risk for drug overdose-Drug delivery-Implantable devices"
Wearable Device for Monitoring Health/Activity Levels,"Existing wearable technology for monitoring activity also monitors heart rates using plethysmography; however, such technology cannot detect respiration or blood oxygenation levels from plethysmograph or from the wrist. Photoplethysmography uses an LED and photodiode to measure reflected light through human tissue. Existing heart monitors and pulse oximetry sensors worn on the finger use photoplethysmography; however, respiration and pulse oximetry have not been performed on the wrist nor is respiration detected from a finger. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a wearable device, i.e., watch, that detects respiration rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation using photoplethysmography. All physiologic measurements are obtained in a single, easy-to-access device that is worn on the wrist. In addition, it can monitor exercise and disease states, such as drug overdose, asthma, seizure, or other health issues, affecting respiration, heart rate, and/or oxygen saturation. In addition, this device calls for emergency response when a drug overdose is detected, breathing/heart rate stops, and/or oxygen saturation drops below an acceptable threshold. This technology makes advances beyond the popular wearable watch that monitors activity, by using technology that monitors an individual's physiologic state and disease state and calls for emergency response.Advantages: -Wearable on wrist-Physiologic measurements-Monitors and detects drug overdose and disease states affecting respiration, heart rate, and/or oxygen saturation -Calls for emergency response-Potential integration with existing technologyPotential Applications: -Monitor health/activity-Detects respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation -Detects drug overdose"
Controlled Growth of Ultranarrow Inorganic Nanowires on 2D Materials,"In the past, nanometer-think 2D layers have not been able to be stacked into 3D architectures.  They use monolayers to modify surfaces to control deposition of additional material layers, but this is inefficient.  This current process limits the scalability at the scale that they want to achieve, limiting their ability to fabricate inorganic architectures at the same scale.  There is a clear need for a new technology that will scale this fabrication at a level that they want to achieve.  Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that allows surfaces to be template with molecular features that can be converted into metallic features with similar size.  Also, the template is noncovalently bound to the substrate.  This may allow for the transferring of the template after features are developed.  This could mean that nm-thick 2D layers could be able to be stacked into 3D architectures.  This could allow for this technology to be more scalable than the current one, opening the door for how nanowires are developed and manufactured.  Advantages: -Converted to metallic features -Noncovalently-ScalablePotential Applications: -Headgroup synthesis-2D materials"
Wearable Biometric to Predict and Prevent Preeclampsia and Hypertension,"Preeclampsia (or pregnancy related hypertension) is the most common complication to occur during pregnancy. It accounts for over $2.18 billion of U.S. health care expenditures in the first 12 months after birth. Of the 131 million pregnancies per year (4 million in the United States), approximately 10 percent are complicated by hypertension, leading to 3 million premature births. New insights suggest compromised blood flow through the kidneys plays a fundamental role in the development of preeclampsia. Researchers at Purdue University are refining a wearable biometric intended to screen for compromised kidney blood flow in 100 percent of pregnant women with the goal of predicting and preventing preeclampsia. Symptoms of preeclampsia can include high blood pressure, protein in the urine, swelling, and seizures. After the 20th week of pregnancy, the mass of the pregnant abdomen is well known to affect kidney blood flow, especially when a woman lies on her back. In women with a vulnerable anatomy, this compromised blood flow leads to high blood pressure. Previously published work has shown that an acute elevation in blood pressure associated with a pregnant woman shifting from her side to her back predicts approximately 90% of preeclampsia. The procedure is known as the supine pressure test (SPT). Furthermore, when detected early, rest in a therapeutic position, on one's side for example, has been shown to prevent preeclampsia. Purdue University researchers have developed a wearable biometric intended to both predict preeclampsia and better manage those women identified to be at risk. The technology couples a blood pressure measuring device with a body position sensor to ensure meticulous execution of the SPT. The device transmits via smartphone the changes in blood pressure and calculated predictive risk to a remote medical location. Sequential testing is intended to optimize test sensitivity. For those women identified to be at risk, the wearable device is also programmed to monitor a pregnant woman's resting position and communicate with her as needed to optimize position. The goal is to better predict and prevent preeclampsia and to allow expecting mothers to monitor their own health without frequent travel to a clinic.Advantages:-Predicts, manages, or prevents preeclampsia-Testing performed in the comfort of home-Results transmit to remote medical professionals-Affordable-PortablePotential Applications: -Early detection and prevention of preeclampsia-Reduce the number of premature births resulting from preeclampsia-Allow expecting mothers to monitor their own blood pressure without traveling to a clinic for frequent monitoring-Similar application available for those with obesity-related hypertension, since physiology has been shown to be similar. U.S. hypertensive population is 76 million."
Smartphone Application Measures Postural Sway,"Postural sway controls the body's weight distribution around its center of mass. Its deviation from normal can be a symptom of a variety of neuromuscular and vestibular disorders. Despite the importance of sway assessment, current technologies used to collect these movements are either too expensive and/or too difficult for the general public to operate outside of a lab environment. Wearable devices that measure human movement can enable daily sway assessment using inexpensive and easier to use sensors.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a mobile system based on a widely available platform (smartphones) and a custom-designed image processing software for human movement and sway assessment. This is a low cost, easy-to-use design that is portable and provides accurate assessments. Older adults, athletes, and others suffering from balance disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, can use this technology. An additional use includes as a screening tool for concussion and/or traumatic brain injury for both athletes and military personnel. It offers the advantages of daily measurement by the end-user. Advantages: -Easy-to-use-Low cost-Accurate-Daily measurementsPotential Applications: -Older adults-Balance disorders such as Parkinson's disease-Screening tool for concussions and/or traumatic brain injury for both athletes and military personnel"
Lignin Biopolymer Based Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs) Used for Harvesting Mechanical Energy,"Lignin, despite being the second most abundant biopolymer on earth, has few practical applications and has a very small market value. Water insoluble Kraft lignin is the most abundant side product produced by the pulp and paper industry at 50 to 100 million tons per year, most of which is burned as cheap fuel. Current applications of lignin are scarce, using only 2 to 5 percent of all lignin produced. Characteristics of lignin, including antioxidant, naturally degradable, biocompatible, and lacking in cytotoxicity, offer its potential use as a constituent in biomedical devices. The disparity in structure and surface properties make it finely tunable for controlled degradation, which is desirable in implanted devices. There remains a need to develop new lignin biopolymers and explore the new utilities of such lignin biopolymers.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a lignin biopolymer based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for harvesting mechanical energy in the environment. Most TENG research focuses on increasing power generation, but economical and eco-friendly obstacles continue to prevail. Lignin offers a valuable opportunity for low-cost TENG applications in self-powered biomedical devices, benefitting from its biodegradability and biocompatibility. In addition to self-powered biomedical devices, this technology presents an opportunity for the development of new technologies that utilize otherwise wasted materials for economically feasible and ecologically friendly production of functional devices in energy, electronics, and sensor applications. Advantages: -Utilizes otherwise wasted material-Economically feasible-Ecologically friendly-Relatively high power densityPotential Applications: -Self-powered biomedical devices-Wearable and implantable electronic devices-Functional devices in energy, electronics and sensor applications"
Diffusive Optical Imaging of Arteries and Lesions in the Mouth for Assisting Oral Surgery ,"The greater palatine artery (GPA) is an anatomical landmark for oral surgery. Currently, a surgeon must rely on prior knowledge of the GPA location to avoid damaging it or surrounding nerves. Unfortunately, studies suggest that there can be a discrepancy of up to 4 mm and this uncertainty can cause a variety of surgical complications and injuries. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method to image arteries and lesions in the roof of the mouth. The technology described uses the contrast in optical properties between the arteries or lesions and the surrounding tissue to locate the GPA and lesions that are not visible to the naked eye. This allows for their exact location and depth to be computationally identified. In addition, researchers can print images of the artery on a surface mask that covers only the regions of tissue above the artery, providing surgeons a guide to areas of the mouth to avoid.  Custom surgical tools of limited length that could not damage the artery can be printed.Advantages:-Reduces likelihood of artery and nerve damage-Computationally identifies the exact location and depth of the GPAPotential Applications:-Custom surgical tools-Oral surgery"
Energy Efficient Electrode Design to Treat Neurological Disorders,"Numerous neurological impairments, including neuromotor deficit, hearing loss, chronic pain, and epilepsy, require the restoration and replacement of bodily functions by virtue of implantable neuroprosthetic devices. Advancements in neuroscience have increased the total market size considerably for various neural stimulation devices that target the spinal cord, cochlear, cerebral cortex, and other peripheral nerves. With advances in neurostimulation technologies, the demand for more precise targeting of neural substrate has fueled the development of higher density electrode arrays to improve the resolution of stimulation outcomes while minimizing unwanted side effects; however, chronic overstimulation is known to cause nerve damage. There is a need for developing higher efficiency, more durable electrodes.Researchers at Purdue University have developed new electrode designs to prolong the lifetime and function efficacy of implantable pulse generators. It was found that certain shapes can be used to more efficiently deliver electrical charge for stimulating the nervous system. Data shows that the electrode design reduces power consumption by up to 50 percent while increasing functionality effectiveness. This new electrode design could be used in implantable simulation systems that are used to treat a large number of neurological disorders. It will work in existing platforms or in a standalone system. Advantages: -Energy efficient-Increases lifetime of system-Increases functionality effectiveness-Compatible with existing platformsPotential Applications: -Implantable neuroprosthetic devices-Implantable pulse generators-Other implantable devices"
Cable-Driven Body Weight Support for Gait Rehabilitation,"Millions of individuals in the United States suffer from walking disabilities caused by stroke. Gait rehabilitation training is an important part of retraining the legs for proper walking, but is challenging given the inability of the disabled legs to support the patient's body weight, particularly in the early stages. To compensate for this issue, body weight support (BWS) systems have been developed to reduce the patient's body weight, so the patient can walk with disabled legs during training without the burden of carrying the entire body weight. Normal walking undergoes 3D motion. Unfortunately, cable-suspended BWS systems balance the patient's body weight in the vertical direction only; there is no support in the other two dimensions. A Purdue University researcher has developed a new cable-driven body weight support system for use in gait rehabilitation training. The BWS system is expected to have the ability to compensate for any amount of a patient's body weight in all three dimensions during gait rehabilitation training. This BWS system is also expected to provide larger workspace, lower equipment cost, ease of assembly and disassembly, and superior reconfigurability. Advantages:-Improved gait rehabilitation training-Efficient and effective body weight support in all three dimensions-Cost-efficient Potential Applications:-Gait rehabilitation training for stroke or trauma victims"
On-Site Diagnosis of Traumatic Brain Injury ,"Microelectromechanical resonators enable sensitive, inexpensive detection of biomarkers, which are indicators of specific diseases, infections, or other medical conditions. However, the detection of s100B, a protein biomarker secreted in the presence of a traumatic brain injury (TBI), is a difficult task to manage. There are numerous methods for identifying biomarkers, but most dependable methods are cumbersome and involve multiple, time-consuming steps that severely limit on-site diagnosis. There is need for a method of detecting biomarkers easily and practically.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel functionalization technique that utilizes a piezoelectrically induced resonant microsystem, a promising medical diagnostic tool with high sensitivity. A plate-style resonator is used to sense biomarkers, including s100B, by detecting changes in mass due to biomarkers. The mechanical resonator demonstrates simple, yet powerful sensor functionality. This could be a feasible solution for successfully diagnosing potential TBI victims at the time of injury. Advantages: -Mechanical, label-free sensing-Provides high-sensitivity sensing in a fraction of the time-Portable, can use on-site-Requires only a small amount of fluid for testing-Allows for dry sensing, which is advantageous for single-use/on-site diagnostic applications Potential Applications: -Medical tools for TBI diagnosisRelated Publications:-Nikhil Bajaj, et al.

Triboelectric Nanogenerators Derived from Natural Materials as Sustainable Power Sources,"Emerging implantable devices demand appropriate power sources that can sustainably operate with minimal intervention. Currently, powering electronics relies on batteries; however, replacing batteries is difficult and expensive, especially for implantable devices. Moreover, materials used for batteries impose health and environmental hazards. Self-powered devices that can harvest energy from its environment, i.e., human body, holds promise for addressing this issue. Mechanical energy is ubiquitous and abundant for powering the sustainable operation of implanted medical devices. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as a promising technology for converting biomechanical energy into electricity. However, materials synthesis in TENG often involves expensive and elaborate processing and the materials are usually not biocompatible or degradable, presenting challenges for successful implementation of TENG in low-cost medical relevant applications.Researchers at Purdue University have developed novel lower-cost, biodegradable, and flexible triboelectric generators (TEGs) based on chitosan derived from crab shells or shrimp, which are currently disposed of in a landfill or the sea by the food processing industry, but could become a byproduct. Tunable electrical outputs were achieved by either mixing the chitosan with other natural materials, such as starch and lignin, or through laser processing. Laser treatment of biopolymer films with increased surface roughness offers a new way for surface engineering. The chitosan-based TEGs present efficient energy conversion performance and tunable degradation rate. The new class of TEGs derived from natural materials may pave the way towards the economically viable production of flexible TEGs for self-powered nanosystems in biomedical and environmental applications.Advantages:-Lower cost-Biodegradable-Self-poweredPotential Applications:-Self-powered nanosystems in biomedical and environment applications-Implantable devices-Wearable electronics"
Algorithm Eliminates Pixel-Dependent Noise from Microscopy Images,"Scientific complementary metal oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) cameras have gained increasing popularity in microscopy developments for biological sciences due to its advances in imaging speed, field of view, and effective quantum efficiency. Unfortunately, its enhanced imaging speed introduces pixel-dependent readout noise, introducing biases and imaging artifact if left untreated. Currently, no algorithm exists for treating pixel-dependent noise/readout noise from microscopy images.Purdue University researchers have developed an algorithm that eliminates pixel-dependent noise/readout noise from microscopy images, restoring it to results seen with an ideal camera, making it possible to perform quantitative studies. Using an sCMOS camera, researchers achieved higher speed and quantum efficiency for scientific research. This technology allows for broad adaption of sCMOS cameras in scientific fields, improving temporal resolution and field of view available by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude.This technology can also be applied to correct the common Poisson and readout noise from microscopy data and is applicable to generic imaging applications where a cutoff frequency exists.   Advantages:-Eliminates sCMOS pixel-dependent noise from microscopy images, restoring it to results seen with an ideal camera-Improves temporal resolution and field of view available by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude-Reduces cost-Improved speed, detection efficiency and chip size-Works with any microscope system with CMOS camera technologyPotential Applications:-Scientific research-Industrial microscopic inspection-CMOS cameras"
Muscle Progenitor Cells  Enhance Innervation,"Denervation, the loss of nerve supply in muscle fibers, occurs from a variety of causes ranging from serious physical injury to chronic disorders. This disruption in nerve fibers may cause flaccid paralysis, eventually leading to severe muscle atrophy. Following a major injury that results in denervation, the physical muscle tissue may heal, but without an adequate, functioning nervous system connection, no effective physical movement can be made. Research in this area has shown that if the damage is contained to certain nerves, the brain might rewire neurological circuitry and resume somewhat normal function. Unfortunately, in cases of muscle denervation, effective physical muscle movement cannot naturally be reversed.  A Purdue University researcher has developed a toolkit and a method for repairing and reconstructing a damaged or nonfunctional muscle using in vitro primed muscle progenitor cells to promote innervation of the damaged or nonfunctional muscle without any genetic manipulation. Muscle progenitor cells are harvested and grown to a critical mass in culture. The cells are then injected into the damaged or nonfunctional muscle and fuse with native muscle fiber. Following the injection, the muscle is innervated, atrophy has been shown to reverse, and the muscle fibers have an increased force of contraction.Advantages:-Does not use genetically modified cells-Allows the body to naturally regrow nerve connections-Clinically translatablePotential Applications-Innervation-Muscle repair-Tissue engineering"
Smart Contact Lens for Therapeutic Applications,"Soft contact lenses could offer an ideal platform for a broad range of devices ranging from medical devices offering ocular pain relief or drug delivery to augmented reality. Unfortunately, until recently, any combination of soft contact lenses with sensors, actuators, or any other semiconductor technology was not possible because current semiconductor processing requires a rigid, planar surface, which is not compatible with the soft, curved shape of a contact lens.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for attaching sensors and other small devices to the soft, curved, silicone-based structure of a soft contact lens. This cutting-edge technology utilizes semiconducting nanomaterials, as well as metallic and insulating traces, to serve as a thermal actuator, a wireless power supply, and an array of sensors. Purdue researchers have used this new therapeutic contact lens system to unclog meibomian glands, the primary cause of dry eye syndrome, via the controlled application of heat to the clogged ducts. With the ability to combine soft, silicon-based contact lenses with a variety of different semiconductor devices, numerous advanced eye care applications are now possible. Advantages:-Noninvasive-Appears to be a standard contact to an observer-Improved eye carePotential Applications:-Treatment of dry eye syndrome-Augmented reality-Flexible ocular medication platform"
Humanlike Smart Electronic Gloves for Prosthetic and Robotic Controls ,"There are approximately 2 million people in the United States that have undergone an amputation and thus require a prosthetic, with an estimated 185,000 new amputees every year (Advanced Amputee Solutions LLC). Prosthetic development has advanced over the past 10 years, but there still remains many issues with the current generation of prosthetics. The advancement of prosthetic hands is of particular concern given the importance of social touch such as handshake, gentle strokes and pats, and even high fives. Disfigurement of the hands affects psychological well-being. Current prosthetic hands allow for artificial skin, but complex geometries lead to poor mechanical/electrical couplings, limiting humanlike social touch.A Purdue University researcher has developed an electronic glove (e-glove) in which various commercial gloves can serve as a platform for functional sensors. It can work with existing prosthetic hands by utilizing their intrinsic ergonomic designs.  In addition, the e-glove incorporates the mechanical softness and physical warmth to replicate humanlike social touch. Advantages:-Simple solution-Fits all prosthetic hands-Improved humanlike social touchPotential Applications:-Prosthetic hand improvement-Assistive robotic hand improvement-General prosthetic development"
Adjustable Ergonomic Firearm Grip,"Currently, assault rifle grips are fixed at a specific angle. This angle is primarily based on the ability to fire a rifle with the center of mass aligned to the forearm, with little to no wrist movement. The grip angle best accommodates shooting from the hip and a traditional bladed rifle stance. When using a bladed stance, the shooter's weak-side shoulder faces the target and the dominant elbow is positioned away from the body. Tactical shooting has led to the development of a squared, or athletic, stance. With the squared stance, the shooter's shoulders are squared-up with the target. The buttstock of the rifle is placed near the centerline of the body and high up on the chest with elbows kept down and tucked in. With current rifle grips, this stance results in ulnar deviation of the wrist causing wrist fatigue and injury.There are a variety of rifle grips on the commercial market that claim to be ergonomic. The majority of ergonomic grips address gripping itself. Instead of being entirely of plastic, the grips often have a rubber coating that conforms more to the shooter's hand. They often have grooves for finger placement as well. Other ergonomic grips attempt to address trigger span or reach, for example a grip that permits the shooter to effectively shim the grip backward to accommodate for a larger trigger reach. Another example is a grip designed to force the shooter to keep their elbows tucked-in to maintain a proper squared/athletic stance. This grip actually results in not only ulnar deviation of the wrist, but also supination (rotation) and extension of the wrist.NSWC Crane has designed, developed, and patented an adjustable ergonomic rifle grip that allows the grip angle to be modified to accommodate different shooting stances. By rotating the grip, wrist fatigue and injury can be minimized by allowing the shooter to hold the weapon at, or closer to, the natural wrist position. Additionally, the rotatable grip could be folded up to the body of the firearm to make it more compact for concealment or storage. Associated intellectual property includes US Patent Application No. 14/984,290 (allowed) and US Patent Application No. 15/432,484."
Biosensor for Detecting Viscosity Changes,"When pharmaceutical preparations are improperly stored, drug safety and efficacy need to be monitored to ensure that the pharmaceutic delivers its intended effect and to prevent potential illness from degraded product. Current screening platforms for the stability of protein-based biopharmaceuticals in high throughput and low volume are unavailable outside of production and quality control laboratories. Miniaturized platforms for analyzing biopharmaceutical degradation could provide significant advantages to current macroscale systems. These include the ability to assess the quality of a pharmaceutical either during development, at distribution points, at the clinic, or within patient homes. Researchers at Purdue University have developed and designed miniaturized platforms for analyzing biopharmaceutical degradation. This technology provides significant advantages to current macroscale systems and allows for rapid testing of pharmaceuticals outside of the quality control laboratory using small sample volumes. The method has been proven with several different biopharmaceutical formulations and can discriminate as little as 5 percent degradation of insulin in a solution. This technology is a new tool for biopharmaceutical analysis and could readily be implemented at key points of the pharmaceutical delivery chain. Advantages:-Requires only a small sample to test-Eliminates the need for lab testing-Eliminates waste by discriminating degraded vs. intact product-Eliminates risk of using inactive biopharmaceutical for patientsPotential Applications:-Insulin testing-Biopharmaceutical efficacy tests"
Transgenically Modified ApoE KO Rats,"Therapeutic development often utilizes transgenically modified animals that lack a specific protein. By ""knocking out"" a gene and observing the corresponding phenotype, investigators can get a better sense of the role that a specific protein plays. Rodent models are particularly useful as many of the physiologic characteristics are similar to humans, while gene modifications are much easier in mice and rats.A Purdue University researcher has developed a knockout rat that is deficient in apolipoprotein E (ApoE), an important protein that which binds to a specific receptor on liver cells and peripheral cells and helps in the transportation and metabolism of cholesterol. This model may be useful for studying cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. This research model will be created using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), injecting recombinant DNA constructs directly into a fertilized egg, and then injecting these eggs into pseudopregnant females.Advantages:-Specific removal of apolipoprotein E with site-specific DNA nucleases-Useful for wide range of clinically relevant disorders including cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's diseasePotential Applications:-Researching cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodevelopment disorders"
Enhanced Imaging Using Vibrational Photoacoustic Tomography ,"Atherosclerosis is a degenerative disease that causes plaque accumulation in the arterial wall that can eventually inhibit blood flow to various tissues and organs. Patients may experience pain when walking and decreased wound healing, which can lead to amputation. In more serious conditions, plaques can rupture, leading to a blood clot that can induce a stroke or heart attack. Aneurysms, on the other hand, occur when the artery wall weakens causing the vessel to bulge. Aneurysms may remain silent or rupture, causing internal bleeding and even death. Diagnosing, treating, and managing atherosclerotic-related diseases represent a significant cost to society. Established methods of diagnosing and monitoring atherosclerosis have limitations such has high cost, long imaging times, and may be minimally invasive. Atherosclerosis-related diseases also have high recurrence rate of between 10 and 20 percent during the first 12 months after treatment. Taken together, these unmet clinical problems suggest that better imaging techniques are needed to cost effectively monitor atherosclerosis progression before, during, and after therapeutic and surgical interventions.Vibrational Photoacoustic Tomography (VPAT) is an emerging imaging method that utilizes pulsed laser light to induce acoustic waves and obtain tissue-specific compositional information. When used in combination with ultrasound, VPAT has the potential to identify the location, size, and distribution of lipids in vivo. This is especially important in atherosclerosis diagnosis, as better techniques are needed to identify and characterize plaques in high-risk and asymptomatic patients. Researchers from Purdue University have developed a photoacoustic probe that allows for improved imaging of tissue. This technology has the ability to rapidly, non-invasively, and cost effectively locate and quantify plaque composition in vivo. VPAT has the potential to be used in the clinic to study atherosclerosis plaque development, evaluate the effectiveness of prospective therapeutics, and improve the diagnosis of atherosclerosis or related vascular diseases.Advantages:-Disease tracking-Does not require contrast agents-Rapid in vivo imaging capabilities-Potential for 3D imaging-Estimated cost is lower than conventional imaging techniquesPotential Applications:-Therapeutic research-Diagnosis of atherosclerosis or related vascular diseases-Determine treatment options"
Clutch Crutch,"According to the Center for Disease Control, assistive devices, such as canes, wheelchairs, walkers, and crutches, are used by an estimated 6.5 million people on a day-to-day basis in the United States. Crutches are currently the most common assistive device used for rehabilitation of injuries to the lower leg. The problem with the most common crutch, the axillary crutch, is that it rests in the user's armpit, which can cause pain and injury. In addition, users do not have use of their arms or hands, making it difficult to perform routine activities such as opening doors.Given the problems with axillary crutches, there is continued R&D efforts for new crutch designs with hands-free options. Products, such as the iWalk*, Rollerfoot*, or Freedom Leg* target people with lower leg injuries. However, these designs each have their own shortfall such as increasing the amount of pressure applied to the knee, cannot be used on stairs, or does not allow for a smooth walking gait. Maintaining an active lifestyle with these designs often result in pain and discomfort over time. Researchers at Purdue University have developed the Clutch Crutch, a hands-free mobility device for individuals with a lower leg injury or a permanent disability. This mobility device attaches to the user's upper thigh and straps around their foot and ankle. The design distributes weight away from the lower leg. The design is modular, which makes it available to people of varying heights, weights, shapes, and lifestyles, allowing for optimal fit. Users assume a normal gait with full use of their hands and the ability to navigate stairs, uneven terrain, etc. In addition, wireless sensors can be integrated into the design to allow for communicating to the user's physician.To view a video related to this technology, click on this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w98En5CcwJ0Advantages:-Normal gait-Full use of hands-Can navigate stairs and uneven terrain-No force below knee-Modifiable-Absorbs shock-More affordable-Wireless communicationPotential Applications:-Rehabilitation-Medical/Health*Trademark"
Skin-Mounted Sweat Sensor,"The state of hydration in humans is a delicate physiological parameter with direct effects on body function at the cellular, organic, and systemic levels. Studies have shown that deviations as small as 2 percent lower than normal can reduce cognitive and physical performance by more than 30 percent. Unfortunately, monitoring and maintaining hydration can be difficult. Methods of analyzing these levels vary between serum ion concentration, urine color, and body mass. Body mass and urine analysis are the more conventional techniques, but lack accuracy due to measurement shortcomings. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a colorimetric dermal patch that measures human hydration by collecting and measuring sweat secretion over small areas of skin. Since most water loss in humans occurs via sweat, this method provides the most accurate analysis of hydration. The device consists of an inexpensive, laser-patterned filter paper sandwiched between two medical grade films, OpSite*. The filter paper contains a water-activated dye that provides an identifiable color change depending on moisture loss from small areas of skin. It is user friendly and easily identifies levels of moisture loss. Advantages:-Accurate-Inexpensive-User friendlyPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Athletics-Cosmetics -Military"
Cold Atmospheric Plasma Device Driven by DC Voltage,"Non-equilibrium atmospheric plasma jets (NEAPJ) are widely used in the fields of sterilization and disinfection without chemical damage to tissue, minimally-invasive surgery, cancer treatment, drug delivery, wound healing, cellular modifications, bioengineering, dermatology, cosmetics, etc. Conventional NEAPJ uses AC voltage or pulsed DC power supplies, which cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) and high ground leakage currents. There is a need for an NEAPJ without such problems.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new device for generating cold plasma jets that uses pure DC voltage as opposed to AC voltage or pulsed DC power devices. Using a pure DC voltage reduces the problems caused by EMI, such as problems with medical monitors and medical devices. When EMI causes such devices to malfunction, it puts the patient at risk.Advantages:-Reduces electromagnetic interference and high ground leakage currents-Does not damage tissuePotential Applications:-Sterilization and disinfection of tissue wounds-Medical applications"
Method and System that Simplifies Sample Prep and Pretreatment for Mass Spectrometer Analysis,"Mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for the analysis of complex mixtures, which provides specific molecular information based on the molecular weights and chemical structures of the target compounds. Current mass spectrometry techniques require the sample to undergo a time-consuming pretreatment and extraction before it can be analyzed with a mass spectrometer. Once the sample has been treated and extracted it must be ionized, allowing for the manipulation and identification of the sample by the mass spectrometer. Each of these steps requires a significant amount of time and any mistakes could invalidate the entire test. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new approach for liquid-solid phase-liquid extractions and provides systems and methods that allow for the combination of sample preparation and pretreatment with the ionization process. Using a thin capillary tube and coating the inner surface with layers of adsorbents, it is possible to maintain full control of the extraction process. The thin capillary tube allows for the quantitative analysis of small sample amounts. In addition, the extraction capillary can serve as an ionization probe, allowing for the extraction, treatment, and analysis by mass spectrometry without separate sample preparation or pretreatment of a target analyte in a sample. Advantages:-Small sample size-Combines sample preparation and pretreatment with the ionization process-Better ionization of samplesPotential Applications:-Mass spectrometry-Chemical analysis"
Revolutionary Prosthetic Ankle ,"Prosthetic devices have improved over time due to changes in design and technology. Today, prosthetics play an important role in allowing amputees to have an active lifestyle. However, these devices are still imperfect and do not mimic various aspects of the human body. Current prosthetics are extremely expensive, weigh between 1.5 and 2 pounds, and frequently break or tear. There is room for improvement in the development of prosthetic devices.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new prosthetic ankle that allows for a wider and more natural range of movement. Made out of aluminum, the prosthetic is composed of a toe joint, a pre-existing incline, and an ankle joint. This device allows for toe flexibility and natural lift, enabling more natural walking, running, and jumping for users.  This prosthetic is lightweight, is estimated to last for five years, and costs a fraction of the price compared to existing prosthetics.Advantages:-Wider range of movement-Improved natural movement for user-Lightweight-Durable-Low costPotential Applications:-Prosthetics for foot amputees including adolescents, the average person, and athletes"
Multianalyte Sensing,"The role of biological sensors is invaluable to the study of life sciences; sensors with higher accuracy, smaller size, or increased functionality enable deeper insights and improved tools for research or medical applications. A major goal of this type of research is a miniature sensor that is capable of sensing multiple substances. These sensors could be implanted in the body for in vivo monitoring of glucose, metabolism, or other biological conditions.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new method for layer-by-layer assembly of enzyme-based amperometric biosensors. The design uses electroactive polymer based nanomaterials to allow for fine control of localization and doping, enabling high spatial and temporal resolution multianalyte sensing. Unlike current functionalization strategies, this one has the electrode actively produce its own entrapment matrix, which makes this method more easily amendable to further miniaturization and multiplexing.Advantages:-Scalability-High spatial and temporal resolution-Adaptable with enzymatic transducers and macro/nanoscale sensing paradigmsPotential Applications:-Glucose sensing chips for blood glucose monitoring-On-chip sensors for metabolites-Implantable electrodes for in vivo monitoring of multiple analytes"
Injectable Elastic Polymeric System for Tissue Scaffolds,"Medications are drugs used to treat, cure, prevent, or diagnose an illness or medical condition. However, sometimes drugs are not effective by simply being ingested. Delivery of local or systemic drugs requires targeted doses to specific parts of the body. The accuracy of delivery is often hampered by inferior mechanical performance of the material used for delivery.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a functionalized hyaluronic acid (HA), a thermo-responsive elastic polymer system comprising functionalized HA, and the methods of fabrication and utilization for drug delivery. This polymer system is injectable and may be used for spatio-temporally controlled delivery of analgesics, anesthetics, antibodies, and other drugs as well as growth factors. Controlled drug delivery offers numerous advantages when compared to conventional dosage forms including improved efficacy, reduced toxicity, reduced need for specialized drug administration, and improved patient compliance/convenience. In addition, HA offers numerous useful biological benefits including wound healing, cell adhesion and proliferation, cell motility, angiogenesis, cellular signaling, and matrix organization.Advantages:-Injectable-Thermo-responsive-Highly elastic-Controlled drug deliveryPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Drug delivery-Tissue engineering"
Tissue Engineering Composites,"Tissue decelluarization has been shown as a viable means of tissue regeneration in the face of traumatic injury or degenerative diseases. Articular cartilage defects are resilient to natural repair and subject to high mechanical forces, which can lead to further tissue degeneration. Current microparticle systems require hostile exogenous crosslinking, have little control over the final microparticle density, and do not investigate the contribution of separate cartilage components to the chondrogenic induction and maintenance. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an alternative method of treatment that allows for custom molding of implants, increased porosity between particles for global cell delivery, and relatively small cartilage thicknesses for promoted cell infiltration. This technology uses native tissue and molecules, making it ideal in the application of articular cartilage. Unlike other methods that use synthetic polymer systems or native polymers that can lead to long-term degradation of cartilage, this technology provides dense packing of embedding matrix and cells.Advantages:-Eliminates potential for degradation of tissue after surgeryPotential Applications:-Biomaterials-Surgical components-Surgical technology"
Diffusion Light Scattering for Nanoparticle Sizing and Biological Assays ,"Bioconjugated nanoparticles are heavily used in diagnostics and therapeutics, but practical analytical tools for detection and characterization of colloidal solutions are greatly needed.  In addition, protein research is an expanding field, but with few tools that allow for high throughput analysis of things such as protein kinetics.  These analyses require detection technologies that can image down to the nanometer scale, but a method that operates at high throughput without the need for large samples does not exist.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology, Diffusion Light Scattering, which is an analyzer that can size nanoparticles and determine the uniformity of the nanoparticle system.  This technology allows researchers to size nanoparticles that they either synthesize or functionalized in lab with a mere microscope, eliminating the need for expensive laboratory equipment.  Sizing techniques often require large sample volumes, but in both biology and nanotechnology, such large sample sizes are difficult to make; this new analyzer uses smaller sample sizes less than 1 microliter.  High throughput real-time analysis of protein binding events, allowing for hundreds of reactions to be studied at the same time is achieved with this analyzer.Advantages:-High throughput -Low sample volumes-Less expensive-Easily integrates with existing platformsPotential Applications:-Protein research-Proteomics-Bioassays-Diagnostics-Therapeutics"
"High-Throughput, Quantitative Sensing of Protein Activity Using DNA-Encoded Probes","Molecular biologists and clinicians studying and diagnosing critical biological problems, including human disease and cancer, rely on methods to detect the activity of proteins that are often costly, not amenable to high-throughput detection, limited by their sensitivity, and ineffective for complex samples. A sensitive method to detect protein activity that overcomes these challenges has the potential to speed the pace and improve the quality of countless endeavors in biomedical research and diagnostics.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a platform that detects enzymatic activity in complex samples with high sensitivity that is cost-effective, high-throughput, and easily analyzed with current instrumentation. To accomplish this, a DNA sequence is used to encode a protein sample's activity in response to the presence of a drug or another change in conditions for each sample in a high-throughput assay. This technology has been successfully employed to detect activity of the metabolic protein, protein kinase A, and the proteins important to cancer biology, farnesyltransferase and caspase 3.Advantages: -Low cost-Highly sensitive-High-throughput profiling Potential applications: -Cancer diagnosis and characterization -Basic research -Drug development"
Portable System for Imaging and Diffractometry,"Large microscopes are used for specimen analysis, restricting use to the laboratory setting. Diffraction measurements require custom built, experimental setups, which usually need a large amount of space and highly trained personnel to operate.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a completely portable package capable of performing bright-field imaging and diffraction-based measurements on samples.  This device includes all optics, electronics, on-board computer, touch-screen, and wireless interface.  Measurements and data analysis can easily occur outside of laboratories because the on-board computer is capable of performing a wide variety of analysis on captured images.Advantages:-Portable-Perform a wide variety of analysis and measurementsPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Medical testing-Research"
Reflection Scatterometer,"Optical interrogation of biological samples are popular in diverse fields from agriculture to biomedical applications because the rapid detection and identification of microbial and bacterial colonies is a critical step in many manufacturing processes. A detection technology, named Bacteria Rapid Detection using Optical Scattering Technology (BARDOT), uses a single wavelength light source cast through a colony to create a scatter pattern that can be identified. However, only using one wavelength limits the technology's ability to differentiate as the desired level of taxonomy becomes more specific. Researchers at Purdue University have expanded the BARDOT technology into a multiple wavelength interrogation instrument that will let the user take advantage of the benefits of scatter patterns from different laser wavelengths. It allows for a measurement time for three different wavelengths under four seconds by using a simple, stackable, cage-type pellicle beam splitter structure. This additional information increases the technology's ability to detect and identify bacteria with greater precision than before. This increased speed and accuracy of detection and identification would save time and money for users in fields ranging from food safety to biosecurity. Advantages: -Detect and identify bacteria with greater precision and more rapidly -Saves time and money Potential Applications: -Medical/Health-Food industry -Biosecurity -Public safety-Agriculture"
Antibody for Listeria Detection,"Listeria monocytogenes (Listeria) is a foodborne pathogen that infects mainly pregnant women, newborns, older adults, and immunocompromised hosts. Methods for detecting Listeria are in high demand, and the most effective methods require highly selective antibodies. Purdue University researchers have generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Listeria.  Monoclonal antibodies are identical antibodies that all recognize the same epitope, a part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system. These highly specific mAbs can be used in bioassays that detect Listeria in food, soil, water, or clinical specimens. Advantages:-Highly selective antibodies can be used for bioassays of other diagnostic toolsPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Diagnostic testing-Bioassay-Food safety"
Bioresorbable Metals for Orthopedic Applications,"Currently, medical operations that require an orthopedic implant must be followed-up with a second surgery to remove the implant or the accompanying hardware of the implant. The additional surgery results in higher medical costs for patients and increases the risk of complications. However, the use of nontoxic, biodegradable implants could eliminate the need for a second surgery. According to BCC Research (2015), the global market for implantable biomaterials is expected to grow through 2019 at a compounded annual growth rate of 6.7 percent.Researchers at Purdue University have developed technology for a resorbable orthopedic implant that is safely absorbed after providing adequate support for damaged bones. This resorbable metal technology provides superior properties over its counterparts, including high porosity for vascular invasion, control of particulate size and degradation rate, and control of mechanical properties to support fixation. Furthermore, the inclusion of hydroxyapatite particulates helps promote bone cell mineralization.Advantages:-Eliminates the need for a second surgery to remove implant-Superior control over porosity, surface area and roughness, and corrosion rates-Promotes bone recovery with the inclusion of hydroxyapatite particulatesPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Orthopedic injuriesRelated Publications:Michael Heiden, Eric Nauman, Lia Stanciu.

Circular Dichroism Spectrometer,"Circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry is a spectroscopic technique where the CD of molecules is measured over a range of wavelengths. It is a very important tool in sensing chiral structures that don't superimpose onto their mirror image and has application areas that include biological sensing, stereochemistry, crystallography, and DNA structural analysis. CD spectrometers measure the spectrum of differential absorption between left and right circularly polarized light (LCP and RCP). Conventional spectrometers utilize a process that includes time-consuming, complicated software and requires increasing the size of the device. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a real-time CD spectrometer that separates LCP and RCP spectra in space using either a dielectric or metallic metasurface. This technology, which is submillimeter in size, includes a spectrometer that conducts real-time, power-efficient measurement without the need for a laser source or broadband lamp. This technology can generate strong phase accumulation, which can be used to reflect or transmit LCP and RCP at a wavelength dependent angle. Advantages: -Eliminates need for a laser, thus eliminating the need to operate with a broadband lamp -Submillimeter in size Potential Applications: Spectrometer use can include, but is not limited to: -Biological sensing -Stereochemistry -Crystallography -DNA structural analysis"
Microfluid Platform to Screen Cancer Drug for Delivery,"Developing and testing cancer drugs is an expensive process that requires, among other things, exhaustive in vivo animal experiments. One purpose of preclinical animal studies is to analyze how effectively a drug is transported and delivered to its target in a tumor mass. However, animal testing can be an expensive, slow process.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a microfluidic platform to simulate a 3D tumor vasculature system. This innovative platform can mimic the complex transport processes inside a tumor, such as transvascular transport, interstitial transport, and transmembrane transport. These processes are all simulated on a single benchtop device, thus improving the repeatability and speed of testing, while reducing the cost and use of animals in drug discovery.Advantages:-Mimics multiple transport processes-Increased repeatability and speed for drug testing-Low costPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical industry-Drug development-Research labsRelated Publications:Bumsoo Han. Physics-inspired micro/nanotherapeutics:  Same problem, different approaches. Molecular Pharmaceutics, July 5, 2016, Vol. 13 (7), pp. 2141-2142. DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00482."
Simultaneous Identification of Multiple Pathogenic Organisms,"Immunodetection in microbiology, biosafety, and biosurveillance is very important for detecting and identifying potentially harmful pathogens. Currently, there are many methods of immunodetection, including traditional optical labeling, such as fluorescence and phosphorescence, and more recent developments using antibody-immobilized bacteria or bacteria bound to microfluidic chips that have been developed to increase optical signals, but many of these techniques are designed to identify a particular type of bacteria and do not allow for multiplexing or simultaneous detection of multiple bacterial species. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for simultaneous identification of multiple pathogenic organisms using heavy metal antibody tagging and plasma-based detection (MAPD). MAPD uses a traditional immuno-recognition approach, but is able to simultaneously detect and identify the presence of multiple antigens without requiring multiple, time-consuming experiments performed in parallel. This method offers fast and sensitive pathogen detection with minimal sample processing and preparation. The use of heavy metal tags generates a very low signal background, which allows MAPD to be used on a large subset of molecular targets that can be combined in a simple, low cost manner. Advantages: -Highly multiplexed classification of pathogens -Fast, sensitive detection with minimal sample processing and preparation -Low numbers of molecules of the target antibody can be measuredPotential Applications:-Microbiology-Biosafety-Biosurveillance"
"Mechanism for Preventing Bone Density Loss from Sedentary Behavior
","When people lead a sedentary lifestyle by choice or due to age or illness for more than 5 to 10 weeks, they often experience significant bone loss and are at high risk for developing osteoporosis and fracturing a bone. When muscles are not used, the muscles atrophy and a loss of muscle strength occurs. Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, are a common occurrence for those that are bedridden or sedentary. As our population continues to age, more people will experience such effects. One challenge of extended space travel is the long-term effects of microgravity on the human body. Approximately 1.5 percent of bone tissue is lost per month of space travel, leading to an increased risk of bone fractures and osteoporosis when astronauts return to earth. Skeletal muscle is no longer required to maintain posture. Given the aforementioned, the unique subset of muscles used in microgravity leads to rapid overall muscle atrophy. In addition, elevated blood calcium levels from bone loss result in dangerous calcification of soft tissues and potential kidney stone formation. It is unknown whether bones ever truly recover completely. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a device that can provide daily mechanical stimulation to an appendage such as an arm, to prevent the loss of bone density and muscle atrophy in a bedridden environment or in space travel. This device is a comfortable, lightweight sleeve that can be worn every day for 30 minutes to promote bone and muscle health for those that are sedentary, bedridden, or traveling in space. The mechanical stimulation encourages natural blood flow throughout the arm, which is known to stimulate and maintain bone density and muscle tone. This device could be used to prevent bedsores in bedridden patients, fracture healing, osteoporosis prevention, and other ailments related to blood circulation. In addition, it could be used after extended space travel.Advantages: -Prevents loss of bone density and muscle atrophy in bedridden or microgravity situations -Prevents bedsores -Osteoporosis prevention -Increases blood circulationPotential Applications: -Aeronautics Engineering/Manufacturing -Medical/Healthcare"
Gas Aided Imaging Using Amphiphilic Block Copolymers ,"Poly (propylene carbonate) (PPC) is a plastic material that can be mass produced from naturally abundant carbon dioxide. This polymer is also known to decompose back to CO2 when heated to a specific temperature. It is a promising material for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications due to this biodegradable and biocompatible nature, and the released gas can be used for imaging, such as ultrasound, when the material is bound to a site within a patient's body. However, the decomposition temperature is above 200 degrees C and bulk PPC is not water soluble. Therefore, use of PPC for such processes has been limited. Conventional gas-containing ultrasound contrast agents consist of a nano- or micron-sized gas bubbles surrounded by a shell layer made of a polymer or lipid. These previous systems have suffered from several problems and shortcomings, including limited stability, low efficiency of delivery, and difficulty of manufacture.Researchers at Purdue University have investigated the thermal degradation of a PPC-based amphiphilic block copolymer, and found that these triblock copolymers form stable small-sized (less than 200 nm) micelles in water. They have also demonstrated that the CO2-generation temperature of PPC can be reduced down to the 40-80 degree C range in aqueous environment by using a catalyst for activating the random scission reaction of PPC. Therefore, with using micelles and the catalyst, the CO2 bubbles can be generated within a target tissue in vivo by delivering the polymer as micelles, and the gas is produced by hydrolysis of the polymer precursor in mild heating conditions.Advantages: -Bubbles generated in target tissue-Enhanced imagingPotential Applications:-Ultrasound devices industry-Biomedical technology"
"Triggerable Oxygen Nanobubbles for Drug Delivery, Diagnosis, and Enhanced Survival ","Ultrasound has a broad clinical utility in prostate cancer diagnosis because of its diagnostic capabilities, ease of use, portability, and ability to reveal fluid flow and structure of anatomy in vivo. Several commercial ultrasound contrast agents exist, but are synthesized using fluorinated gases or air and have sizes in the micron range. Past efforts have at most synthesized ~500 nm-sized particles and primarily functioned as a contrast agent. These large particles fail to take advantage of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Researchers at Purdue University have capitalized on the broad clinical utility of ultrasound. This technology is the first nanosized oxygen- and cargo-bearing bubbles that can be tuned to first image at a low intensity and selectively release cargo upon an ultrasound trigger at a higher intensity. Advantages:-Enhanced permeability and retention inside tumor vasculature. -Controlled drug release -Avoids immune system response. -Transport of material through the encapsulating layer. Potential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industry-Medical/Healthcare-Cancer drug delivery and diagnosis-Therapy for cancerous tumors"
Ambient Ion Focusing and Continuous Atmospheric Pressure Introduction of Ions into a Miniature Mass Spectrometer,"The reduction to practice of a mass spectrometer began in the late 19th century. By 1958, the machines had evolved to a point where amino acids and peptides structures could be roughly analyzed. As scientists began to understand the varied applications that could be applied, mass spectrometers began appearing in operating rooms, outer space, and many scientific laboratories studying pharmacology, proteomics, metabolomics, glycans, atoms, and gas samples. During its evolution, the mass spectrometer grew bigger and more complex. Starting in the late 1990s and early 2000s, scientists began to construct smaller mass spectrometers for easy sample collection in hospitals and developing countries. Due to the nature of loading a sample in the machine and converting it into ions, the current equipment requires a vacuum, pump, and large amount of energy to maintain pressure and move the ions through the chambers into the analyzer. Changes to components on the mass spectrometer will create a more advantageous power-to-pump ratio, but will reduce the transfer efficiency of the ions through the chambers. Smaller, mobile mass spectrometers require a novel ion loading mechanism for improved integration into varying environments.Purdue University researchers have developed a device that can produce and focus a stream of ions into a mass spectrometer at atmospheric pressure or higher. This new component works with existing mass spectrometers, reduces the amount of power required to load and analyze a sample, and will not hinder the mobility of a small mass spectrometer.Advantages:-Produce and focus a steam of ions at atmosphere pressure or higher-Works with existing mass spectrometers-Uses less power-Does not hinder mobility of small mass spectrometersPotential Applications:-Laboratories-Mass Spectrometer Manufacturers"
Diaper-Embedded Transponder for Monitoring Urinary Tract Infection,"Urinary tract infections account for more than 8.1 million visits to physicians' offices per year. If not identified and treated early, urinary tract infections can be a major source of additional disease. To identify urinary tract infections, urine collection and lab urinalysis are two methods currently used; however, there is no existing method that uses a diaper-embedded sensor for patients and infants.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a diaper-embedded transponder for early detection/screening of urinary tract infections. Once activated by urine, the transponder measures and transmits the information via a wireless link to the caregiver. The transponder is autonomous, self-powered, and it provides accurate and timely information.  Advantages: -Diaper embedded-Autonomous and self-powered-Provides accurate and timely informationPotential Applications:-Nursing homes-Hospitals-Nurseries"
High Strength Biomimetic Adhesives with Degradability and Biocompatibility,"High strength adhesives are in demand for a variety of applications due to their ability to create lightweight, nondestructive bonds between substrates. To obtain such adhesion, several synthetic polymers are used in adhesives such as Gorilla Glue, Super Glue, and Elmer's glue. Unfortunately, these synthetics often require massive amounts of oil during manufacturing and are not biodegradable, which limits their use in many applications such as biomedical products. Purdue University researchers have developed super strong adhesives by incorporating lactic acid with mussel adhesive chemistry. Lactic acid, which can be derived from corn, enables the incorporation of a sustainable monomer into the backbone and is FDA approved for internal use in humans, opening the door into many biomedical uses. The adhesives use a polyester backbone, which degrades into nontoxic components, a beneficial characteristic in surgical adhesives. In laboratory testing, this biomimetic approach has produced some of the strongest commercial adhesives ever. To view a video related to this technology, click this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PReTYtw3MCM Advantages: -Nontoxic and biocompatible -Made from a renewable resource -Sets when wet -Environmentally friendly and degradablePotential Applications:-Biomedical industry-Electronics industry-Cosmetics industry"
Implantable Catheter for the Prevention of Cellular Occlusion,"At present, central venous access devices have a high failure rate due to cellular obstructions or thrombus formation that can be lethal for patients. For conditions, such as hydrocephalus, a method to resolve these issues is in situ recanalization after revision surgery and in-patient neurosurgery, while for central venous access, there needs to be full replacement of these devices. Often times, patients need to be concomitantly treated with blood thinners, antibiotics, and other drugs that have other side effects. Therefore, both processes can be costly, risky, and painful for patients. To resolve such issues, researchers at Purdue University have looked at the well-known technique of magnetic nanoparticle induced hyperthermia for treatment of cancer cells and used this method to coat or infuse magnetic nanoparticles on implantable catheters. This would induce localized heat (hyperthermia) using external magnetic fields and help to remove or prevent cellular occlusion at the site of these catheters that are used for various medical procedures. This technology would also reduce the need for revision surgery or replacement of devices and can be used in situ and activated non-invasively, making it much safer and cost-effective. To view a video related to this technology, click on this link:  https://youtu.be/ooCUSTkPGfkAdvantages: -Induces localized heat (hyperthermia) -Removes/prevents cellular occlusion -Reduces need for surgery and replacement of devicesPotential Applications:-Implantable devices-Medical/Health"
Skin and Tissue Simulant for Munitions Testing,"Determining the penetration potential of munition projectiles into human tissue is very common but the existent methods does not replicate the significant resistance that human skin provides. Common testing materials include animal skin, cling wrap, and natural rubber. These substitutes are unhygienic, too weak to simulate human skin, or the properties vary within one sample.Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane), has developed, designed, and patented a skin and tissue simulant for munitions testing that replicates the significant resistance that human skin provides to prevent munition projectiles from penetrating into human tissue. This technology includes a gelatin composite block and an ether based cast polyurethane sheet. The gelatin composite block acts as the tissue simulant and the sheet acts as the skin simulant to determine the potential a given munition projectile has for penetrating skin. This new and improved skin and tissue simulant is an advancement over old testing materials because it adds the resistance that is naturally present in a human body.Advantages:-Superior simulant with valid penetration evaluation -More hygienic than typical simulants-Consistent or with less variations in raw materialsPotential Applications:-Medical testing-Veterinary-Hunting-Weapons testing"
Assistive Interface for the Visually Impaired,"At present, if we look at blind or visually impaired (BVI) people, there is no suitable substitute technology to enable this population to interpret visual scientific data from lab experimentation in real time, such as performing light microscopy, spectrometry, chemical reactions, and using other scientific instruments. Current technologies for this purpose include tactile paper, which is limited because it is not real time, has to be made in advance, requires more staff, and does not allow independent work for blind students. To address this challenge, Purdue University researchers developed a real-time multimodal image perception system to transform scientific data to something more useful. Image features such as size, color, shape, intensity, location, texture, and opacity are individually mapped through three different sensory channels of hearing, haptics, and vibrotactility. Experimental results have confirmed that this real-time approach provides greater accuracy in recognizing and analyzing objects within images compared to tactile papers. Participants have also shown better analytic performance with this technology compared to other one-sensory standard interfaces. Although this technology may take more time when exploring an image, it also allows higher accuracy during the actual analysis of that information. Thus, this technology has potential use during lab experimentation for BVI people, which would greatly enhance information interpretation. It would allow advancement in careers in medicine, biology, chemistry, and others alike that has so far been restricted for this population. Advantages: -Real-time interface -Multiple image features -Three sensory channelsPotential Applications:-University, government, and corporate labs"
Novel Imaging to Study Cell Functions,"At present, a problem with assays used to check the distribution of cholesterol in cells are limited by separation techniques and use of cholesterol oxidase, radiolabeled cholesterol, and fixation by filipin in cells, which allows for imaging cholesterol in a living system. Researchers at Purdue University have utilized Raman tags (with tagged cholesterol) that provide a new innovative method to image these small molecules and help visualize cholesterol metabolism, neuronal activity, and drug delivery. These tags can visualize molecules, such as EdU and cytochrome c, via a Raman microscope. The alkyne tags also allow direct visualization of DNA synthesis and cytochrome c release from mitochondria in living cells. This enhanced imaging technique is due to the large scattering cross sections of the alkyne tags that are biologically inert. With this new technology, there is potential for use in the study of NP-C, which is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that use lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and can be used for atherosclerosis and various cancer diagnoses. Therefore, genomic screening of cholesterol related genes could lead to an improvement in therapy and management of these conditions. Advantages: -Images small cholesterol based molecules -Biologically inert and better scattering section -Can be applied to screen multiple conditionsPotential Applications:-Therapy-Health condition management"
Perforated MOS Structure for Single Biomolecule Detection,"Characterizing and sequencing single biomolecules, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, carbohydrates, etc., offers significant impact to science, medicine, and biotechnology. Single biomolecule detection has many benefits and could allow for early disease detection and screening, have pharmacological relevance, and help in understanding genetic information encoded in DNA. There are many proposed methods of studying single biomolecules, but they have several limitations. Many techniques require the isolation of the molecule prior to study, and most techniques are also limited by sample preparation, sensitivity, and specificity to specific categories of biomolecules. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for single biomolecule detection that allows for characterization and sequencing of biomolecules without the limitations of current nanochannel technologies. This method uses a metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensor with embedded, fluidic nanochannels. As a biomolecule moves through the nanochannel, a high frequency current is generated that contains information about the biomolecule, such as the type of nucleotides in the case of DNA/RNA, which can be used to sequence the molecule. This method does not have the problems associated with other nanopore techniques because it does not require the difficult drilling of extremely small nanopores, can detect four nucleotides at a time, and is not significantly affected by the rotation or position of the biomolecule in the nanochannel. Advantages: -Detection of single molecule or low concentration biomolecules, bio-polymers, RNAs, DNAs, carbohydrates, proteins, viruses, and virions -Lowers the cost of sequencing single molecule DNAs, RNAs, and carbohydrates -Addresses shortcomings of current nanochannel technologyPotential Applications:-Development of tools for early detection of a number of diseases and environmental hazards-Biomedical applications in diagnosis and therapy-Early detection of viruses-Study of carbohydrates-Genetics"
Electromagnetic Drug Delivery Using Nanowires,"Targeted drug delivery methods aim to confine the concentration of medication in some body parts relative to others. The goal of such treatments is to target only the diseased tissue maximizing the effectiveness of each dose and reducing negative side effects in other tissues. Cancer treatment is one of the most highly researched areas within targeted drug delivery due to the potential of therapies that target tumors, avoiding the nonspecific side effects of chemotherapy. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an electromagnetic drug delivery system constructed of polypyrrole (PPy) nanowire matting. This material is designed to act as a reservoir for drugs, and is responsive to an externally applied electromagnetic field (EMF) that induces the release of the captured drug into the local environment. Delivery can be turned on or off by using the noninvasive EMF source located remotely from the PPy drug reservoir. The therapeutic agent can be delivered from the inserted or surgically placed PPy mat for many weeks, and the specific region that is targeted can receive very high drug concentrations while systemic regions remain unaffected. Advantages: -Localized drug targeting -Dosage control -Reduction in negative, systemic side effects Potential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical Industry"
SafePace:  Pacemaker Lead Placement System,"Pacemakers are biomedical devices implanted into patients with hearts that have difficulty pumping blood throughout the body. Electrical stimulation from leads in the pacemaker helps the cardiac tissue contract in an effective rhythm. The stability of the pacemaker leads must be assessed to guarantee successful pacemaker implantation, but current methods of testing can leave a wide range of inconclusive results.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new device that will allow surgeons to accurately determine if pacemaker leads have been implanted stably. The device will be fitted mechanically to the pacemaker lead and the surgeon will easily be able to determine if the device disengages from the lead or not. If the device disengages, the implantation has been successful. Otherwise, if the device does not disengage, the implantation is not stable and the pacemaker implantation must be repeated. This device provides a simple method for testing pacemaker lead stability with a clear result.To view a video related to this technology, click on this link:  http://youtu.be/YMSs4vFzf48Advantages:-Simple to use-Clear, accurate answer about pacemaker lead stabilityPotential Applications:-Medical/Health"
Metabolite-Imaging Mass Spectrometry to Guide Brain Surgery,"Currently, one of the main treatments for brain tumors is surgery. Performing a tumor resection within the brain is difficult because it is not easy to distinguish tumor boundaries from healthy brain tissue. Existing imaging techniques do not provide the necessary molecular information to distinguish tumor boundaries. An unclear boundary between a tumor and healthy tissue can lead to inadequate resection if enough of the tumor remains and neurological damage if healthy tissue is removed.Purdue University researchers have developed a method for surgeons to define tumor margins quickly during surgery using miniature mass spectrometers or separate ionization techniques. This method overcomes the need for prepping, staining, and evaluation by a pathologist. It is also possible to adapt this method for other types of cancer surgery.Advantages:-Overcomes need for prepping, staining, and evaluation by a pathologist-Can be used to determine tumor boundariesPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Cancer surgery"
Oxygen Generator to Aid Cancer Treatment,"Radiation, surgery, and chemotherapy are the three major treatments for cancer. Radiation destroys cancer cells by using high-energy photons to damage the cell's DNA. The effectiveness of radiation is dependent upon the oxygen concentration in tumors; however, the abnormal structures of tumor vasculature are leaky, lending the tumor environment hypoxic. Hypoxia can impede the success of radiation therapy because oxygen is necessary for successful cancer treatment. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an ultrasonically powered, implantable micro-oxygen generator that can increase oxygen levels in a tumor target during radiation treatment. The generator has overall dimensions of 1.2mm x 1.3mm x 8mm, so it is small enough to be implanted using a hypodermic needle. This technology performs electrolysis to generate oxygen, which may be able to restore intratumoral oxygen concentrations to a normal or hyperoxygenated level, increasing the effectiveness of cancer treatment outcomes. Advantages: -Increases effectiveness of cancer radiation treatments -Small size allows easy implantation -Ultrasonically powered using external sourcePotential Applications:-Cancer Treatment-Pharmaceuticals-Medical Devices-Medical/Health"
Nanostructured Bioactive Stent to Induce Closure of Cerebral Aneurysms,"According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, brain aneurysms can occur to anyone at any age. Aneurysms occur when a weak section of a blood vessel balloons out and fills with blood. These can burst and cause severe internal bleeding, nerve damage, or stroke. There are currently two methods of treating an aneurysm that has burst: clipping and coiling. Clipping, like the name suggests, requires a dangerous surgery to open the brain and expose the aneurysm which is then clipped shut with a small metal clip. Coiling involves threading a catheter through an artery to the site of the aneurysm, and once there, tiny platinum coils are released to block the leak and cause the blood to clot. The danger with coiling is the chance of forming unwanted blood clots in the cerebral artery.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a bioactive stent that allows surgeons to quickly stop the bleeding without brain surgery or risk of unwanted clots. The stent is designed to attract biological cells to its surface where a special coating promotes tissue growth and healing. The stent is inserted at the aneurysm similarly to the coiling method where it attaches to the aneurysms neck and begins the healing process. By securely attaching to the artery, the risk of blood clots is minimized. This method allows surgeons to quickly treat and heal cerebral aneurysms, thereby saving thousands of lives each year.Advantages:-Attracts cells to quickly close aneurysmPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Medical devices"
Sepsis Treatment Derived from Chitosan,"Septicemia refers to the presence of pathogens in the bloodstream that leads to sepsis, a potentially life-threatening medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation and the presence of infection. When microbes infect the blood, skin, lungs or other tissues, the body's immune system generates an inflammatory response in an attempt to fight the infection. The body's immune response to the infection causes the characteristic symptoms of sepsis and can lead to organ failure. The current treatment for sepsis requires antibiotics, fluid drainage, blood transfusions, and dialysis. Since individual cases are caused by different microbes, the correct antibiotic must be chosen to treat the infection. This causes a delay in treatment, which leads to an increase in the mortality rate. Purdue University researchers have developed a novel treatment for septicemia involving molecules derived from chitosan. Chitosan is a linear carbohydrate with many commercial and biomedical uses. This treatment inactivates endotoxins, which are toxins associated with certain types of bacteria and stimulates cytokine release (part of the body's inflammatory response that causes swelling and high fever). This new chitosan shows many advantages over current IV treatments for septicemia. This technology can be used to filter endotoxins out of plasmid DNA samples and filter bacteria from water, making contaminated water samples safe to drink. Advantages: -Stronger affinity for inactivating endotoxins -Excellent biocompatibility upon injection -Lower potential to cause hemolysis, complement activation, and inflammatory responses -Can filter endotoxins out of plasmid DNA samples and remove bacteria from waterPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Sepsis treatment-Contaminant removal from drinking waterRelated Publications:Yoon Yeo, et al. Zwitterionic chitosan for the systemic treatment of sepsis. Scientific Reports 6, Article number: 29739 (2016). doi:10.1038/srep29739 https://www.nature.com/articles/srep29739"
Radiofrequency Probe for Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy,"Currently, nanoscale imaging methods are limited due to the inability to investigate structural and chemical information at the single cell level. While there are imaging techniques that can be used for determining nanoscale structural information, these techniques are unsuitable for applications with living biological materials. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for the investigation of structural and chemical information at the single cell level. This method uses a radiofrequency probe coupled with an atomic force microscopy cantilever for precise localization to areas of interest and magnetic resonance for determining nanoscale structural information. This technology couples the precision of atomic force microscopy with magnetic resonance imaging to allow for single cell imaging of living biological materials. This technology will allow researchers to gather nanoscale information on the surface and subsurface levels of individual cells. Advantages: -Offers precise localization to features/materials of interest -Provides nanoscale structural information in addition to local spectroscopic information -Suitable for investigation at the single cell levelPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Imaging"
Implantable Pressure Sensor with Integrated Guyton Chamber,"Monitoring in vivo pressure is a critical element in many medical applications including cancer and glaucoma treatment. However, the interaction of biological materials with pressure sensors leads to sensor drift, which causes the pressure sensors to become highly inaccurate and lose sensitivity after a short time. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an implantable pressure sensor that eliminates the interaction of cells and other biological materials with the sensor. This sensor uses an integrated Guyton chamber that separates the pressure sensor from the surrounding cells and biomolecules. Thus, in vivo pressure can be monitored for a much longer time than current methods while maintaining high accuracy. This method can be used for several types of sensors including capacitive and piezoresistive sensors. Advantages: -Protects pressure sensor from long-term drift -Can be used for several types of sensorsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare"
Wireless Tracking for Radiation Cancer Therapy,"A serious side effect of radiation therapy for cancer treatment is that it kills healthy cells as well as cancerous cells. To limit the damage to healthy tissue, radiation is directed only to the area around the tumor, which is not easy because of organ movement within the body. Organ movement must be tracked to minimize collateral damage. Wired and wireless tracking systems currently exist, but both have drawbacks. Wired systems require wires to extend through the skin, which increases the risk of infection and can be mentally distressing to a patient. Existing wireless systems use passive transponders and can only track one at a time. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel wireless magnetic tracking system that may include a plurality of transmitting coils each configured to generate a magnetic field when energized by active transponders, which may include at least two magneto-resistive sensors. Multiple transponders can be tracked quickly and accurately. The transponders can also function as dosimeters to measure the radiation intensities at various sites.Advantages:-Transponders have integrated sensors-Multiple transponders can be usedPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Cancer treatment-Radiation therapy"
Implantable Wireless Glucose Sensor,"Type 1 diabetes afflicts approximately one million people living in the United States and 10 to 20 million people worldwide. Caused by the body's inability to produce its own insulin to regulate blood glucose levels, type 1 diabetes can cause a wide variety of complications and requires careful monitoring of glucose levels and insulin injections. The most common way to monitor blood glucose levels is with a finger stick, which measures glucose at a point in time, potentially missing important fluctuations, such as sudden hypoglycemic episodes. The most effective way to measure glucose levels is to monitor it continuously in a way that it could be recorded and tracked. To accomplish this, various monitor designs have been proposed, including several designs for implantable sensors, but most require an internal power supply or make use of potentially dangerous enzymes. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new design for an implantable glucose monitor that requires no internal power and has a fast reaction time to changes in glucose levels. This device uses a glucose sensitive ferrogel, which grows and shrinks based on the level of glucose present. This device is expected to have an area no larger than one cubic centimeter and once implanted into the body's soft-tissue, the ferrogel's change in size can be detected wirelessly, providing a continuous measurement of glucose levels.Advantages:-Device requires no internal power supply-Fast reaction time to changes in glucose levels-Provides continuous measurement of glucose levelsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceutical industry"
Method of Osteochondral Tissue Engineering,"Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease affecting joints. It is characterized by the wearing of articular cartilage, hyaline cartilage found at the ends of bones to cushion the joint. Articular cartilage facilitates the smooth, painless movement of joints. The goal of treating articular cartilage damage is to provide relief from joint pain, slow the progression of damage, and delay joint replacement surgery; however, treatment is difficult due to the inherent properties of cartilage tissue. Recently, tissue engineering based methods have shown promise; however, they result in tissues that are structurally inferior to natural cartilage. Purdue University researchers have developed a novel technique to produce osteochondral tissue. This unique fabrication method, Magnetic Prototyping in 3D (MAP3D), can control zonal collagen orientation in a noninvasive manner. MAP3D layered osteochondral constructs have precise collagen alignment that mimics the native tissue, incorporating many key structural elements to modulate depth-dependent biomechanical properties and localizing protein expression. MAP3D allows for tailored macroscale function that can promote joint preservation and prolong the time patients can function before needing total joint replacement surgery. Advantages: -Compressive stiffness of the collagen scaffold is increased by 50 percent -Controls collagen alignment noninvasively -Collagen alignment mimics natural tissuePotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Biotechnology"
Morphologically Friendly Tissue Imaging,"Imaging mass spectrometry is currently in the translational phase as a tool in medical histopathology and offers a capability of mapping drugs, metabolites, lipids, peptides, and proteins without the need for labeling. Currently, a primary limitation preventing good correlational analysis is the use of chemicals that destroy native tissue structures.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel, morphologically friendly method for DESI-MS tissue imaging. The use of processing chemicals that preserve native tissue structures, instead of destroying them, expands the applications of DESI-MS to tissue imaging. DESI-MS has been used in real time to help surgeons decide how much tissue to take during cancer removal procedures. This new morphologically friendly procedure allows a facile means to distinguish between cancerous and healthy tissues. Advantages:-Native tissue structure preserved	 -Enhanced imaging of complex cancerous tissuesPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Medical imaging"
Sensitive Folate Receptor Detection by Immunomagnetic Diffractometry,"Despite the diversity of available malignant disease detection platforms, important challenges still remain in minimizing sensor size, reducing detection time, eliminating target-labeling requirements, minimizing signal amplification steps, and developing simple and inexpensive fabrication protocols.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an integrated approach for the rapid detection of the folate receptor (FR) using in situ assembled optical diffraction gratings in combination with immunomagnetic capture. With this approach, a detection sensitivity of 700 fM (20 pg/ml) was achieved without any fluorescent or radiolabels or any secondary signal amplification. This approach can be applied to other targets and has the potential to be a broadly applicable, highly sensitive analysis technique. Advantages:-Allows early detection of cancer-Sensitive to femtomolar concentrations-Simpler assay with lower detection limit compared to current standardPotential Applications:-Cancer Detection-Medical/Healthcare"
DNA Modified Nanocomposite Microbiosensors,"Electrochemical biosensors have offered new insights into cellular metabolism. The technology allows scientists to measure the metabolic activity (oxygen, glucose, lactate, etc.) of a single cell or a group of cells. Conventional biosensor materials suffer from low sensitivity and low spatial resolution, but single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) combined with black nanoparticles have been shown to significantly enhance performance. However, it was noted that the carbon nanotubes suffer from aqueous insolubility, limiting the ability to interact with the metabolite of interest.   Purdue University researchers have developed a technology that uses nanocomposites in electrochemical biosensors. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was used to modify SWCNTs to increase solubility in water, making it more useful in physiological applications. The ssDNA-SWCNT nanocomposite exhibits high sensitivity, wide linear range of detection, and low limit detection. This work is significant to biosensor development because this is the first demonstration of ssDNA-SWCNT nanocomposite as a platform for constructing both single-enzyme and multi-enzyme biosensors for physiological applications.Advantages:-Increased sensitivity and spatial resolution-Lowered limit of detectionPotential Applications:-Genetics-Biotechnology"
Imaging for the Prediction and/or Detection of Skin Cancer,"Recent animal studies have demonstrated that primary tumor formation sites can be discerned before a tumor develops by taking measurements of the hemoglobin and extracellular matrix structures in the skin.Purdue University researchers have developed a technique (and possible device) to predict where a tumor will form on the skin after exposure to a carcinogen. The current area surveyed can be a few hundred millimeters squared and penetrates two millimeters in depth. In mouse studies, the technique predicted the result of foci with a high statistical accuracy. Applications of this technology include tissue engineering scaffold development, dermatology rejuvenation and diagnosis, diagnostic screening of patients who have undergone laser treatments, toxicology studies testing the response to a drug, and devices for pathologist to use in the operating room to get a better understanding of the margins on a tumor.Advantages:-Predicts where a tumor will form on the skin-Can help surgeons better understand the margins of a tumor-High statistical accuracy in mouse studiesPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Medical imaging-Cancer detection"
Detection of Oxidized Proteins for Medical Diagnostics,"Oxidative damage to DNA, RNA, and proteins can seriously threaten the survival of a biological system. High concentrations of radical oxygen species have been implicated in many diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and a variety of inflammatory diseases. Oxidative stress appears to be caused in part by an organism using iron to carry out oxidative processes. Free radicals, ranging from hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, and peroxynitrite to superoxide, occur widely in cells as part of the assimilation and metabolism of nutrients. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a diagnostic method for determining the absence or presence of a disease. This method includes assaying the amount and/or type of oxidized peptides in a sample from a subject and comparing them to the amount and types of reference oxidized peptides. For example, using this technique could identify and quantify changes in oxidized peptides or oxidized proteins associated with diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus or breast cancer. This diagnostic method can also be used to monitor a patient's response to a therapeutic agent, e.g., an antioxidant, and monitor disease recurrence. Using the vital information collected with this method, a tailored treatment plan can be created to better aid a patient's recovery. Advantages: -Proteomic approach to disease monitoring and diagnosis -Protein biomarkers detected at low concentrations -Earlier detection of a large number of diseases -Non-invasive testPotential Applications:-Bioinformatics-Medical/Healthcare"
Selective Capture and Identification of Bacteria,"Rapid identification of infectious pathogens is crucial in limiting the spread of contagious diseases. Unfortunately, current tests for most pathogens require hours or days of processing time. Antibody-based detection strategies have shown faster testing times, but become obsolete when the pathogen mutates its antibody binding sites. With the emergence of increasingly virulent strains of common pathogens, there is a need for new strategies with rapid turnaround times and the ability to detect mutated strains.Purdue University researchers have developed a novel technique for selective capture and identification of pathogenic bacteria using immutable ligands. These are pathogen-specific ligands that the disease-causing organism must bind to in order to remain virulent. Examples of immutable ligands include host cell surface molecules that the pathogen must bind to in order to infect its host and nutrient molecules that the microbe must internalize to survive. This method first immobilizes the immutable ligand onto a chip. When the chip is exposed to its matching pathogen, binding occurs. The chip can then be quantitatively evaluated using image processing algorithms, which are not only fast and accurate, but can also be used in a multiplex approach where a sample can be screened for a wide variety of pathogens simultaneously.Advantages:-Rapid multiplex test results-Detection invulnerable to pathogen mutationsPotential Applications:-Biotechnology-Toxin Detection-Medical/Healthcare"
Touch Actuated Micropump for Transdermal Drug Delivery,"Transdermal delivery of medications and other compounds has been aggressively pursued for many decades. Although patches have been used to deliver small hydrophobic molecules such as nicotine and nitroglycerin, an external pressure source in conjunction with a direct subcutaneous access port are required to deliver the majority of therapeutically important drugs through the skin. Microfluidics has played an important role in this area by providing microneedle arrays and miniature pumps. Although microneedle arrays made of silicon, polymers, and metals have reached a high degree of maturity in the past decade, their application has been limited due to the lack of a suitable micropump with adequate flow rate and back pressure.Purdue University researchers have developed a new type of pump for drug-delivery patches that would use arrays of microneedles to deliver a wider range of medications possible than with conventional patches. The pump contains a liquid that boils at body temperature so that the heat from a finger's touch causes it to rapidly turn into a vapor, exerting enough pressure to dispense the drug through the microneedles. This technology's low-cost and battery-less operation make it the ideal single-use disposable transdermal drug dispenser. Advantages:-Battery-less operation-Low-cost and disposablePotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Medical devices-Pharmaceuticals-Drug development"
Flexible Neural Probe for Magnetic Insertion,"The brain is soft and compliant; a successful probe needs to match the mechanical properties of the brain. Foreign body response is also reduced in objects with small diameters. Small, thin probes lack the mechanical strength needed for implantation. In order to puncture the tissue, they would need to be hard, which is not compatible with the mechanical properties of the brain. In addition, to minimize tissue response, a probe would need to be thin. With conventional materials, this would make the probe brittle and prone to fracture. Probes for neural applications are often limited by their properties; most electrodes are made of hard, stiff materials and are restricted by dimensions for insertion. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology to allow for the use of tissue-compliant materials as neural probes. The technology uses insulated wires affixed to a magnetically responsive tip in order to insert a probe into the brain. This tether allows magnetically induced insertion of small thin probes that minimize tissue damage responses and match the mechanical properties of the brain. Advantages: -Allows for use of soft, compliant materials that more closely match brain tissue -Not limited in dimension -Minimizes tissue damage in deep brain stimulator applicationsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Medical devices"
"Biocompatible Encapsulation of Living Cells and Tissues
","Type 1 diabetes affects approximately two million people in the United States alone. The disease is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system destroys the pancreatic islet beta cells, sufficiently stopping the production of insulin. Current therapies can only treat the disease instead of cure it. Insulin therapy requires lifelong injections of insulin every day and does not prevent against chronic complications. A pancreas transplant requires life-long immunosuppression therapy, and current islet transplantations offer an initial success, but drops off with time. Other challenges associated with islet transplantation include cadaveric donor islet availability and a loss of islets in the immediate post-transplant period because of innate immune responses.Researchers at Purdue University have developed sol-gel encapsulation techniques to optimize the sustainability of islet transplantation treatment. Using this technique, the researchers are able to encapsulate cells enabling immunoisolation, vascularization, and long-term survival of the transplanted islets that can reinstate insulin production, leading to normal glucose control in type 1 diabetes patients. Studies with encapsulated pancreatic beta cells show glucose flux oscillation similar to uncoated pancreatic beta cells. Purdue researchers are collaborating with scientists at the Indiana School of Medicine and performing in vivo studies of the encapsulated islets on diabetic research mice.   Advantages:-Sol-gel encapsulated islet cells are isolated from the innate immune response-Islet cell transplantation would give type 1 diabetes patients a long-term treatment option-Preliminary studies in vitro and in vivo show cells maintain viability and function after encapsulationPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals"
Body Fluid Component Electrochemical Biosensor ,"There is a growing need for more sensitive instruments for biological sensing. With medical research proving that even minute changes in body fluid can show early warning signs of diseases, such as cancer, biosensors need to be sufficiently sensitive to detect these changes.Purdue University researchers have developed a functioning biosensor technology that incorporates nanotubes to successfully immobilize the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx). This permits the sensing of glucose in a blood sample with greatly improved sensitivity over existing technologies, and there are expectations that this technology could be applied to monitor glucose levels in other body fluids, such as saliva. The general nature of this technology means that it could be readily adapted to sense other important body fluid components. Advantages:-Monitors minute changes in glucose levels -Could be adapted to sense other body fluid componentsPotential Applications:-Medical/Health"
Algorithm for Measuring Blood Pressure,"Blood pressure in the circulatory system alternates between systolic pressure (maximum) and diastolic pressure (minimum) with each heartbeat. A sphygmomanometer, a cuff placed around the upper arm to cut off blood flow in the arteries, measures these pressures.  As pressure is released from the cuff, a whooshing sound is heard when blood starts to flow in the artery (systolic).  As pressure is further released from the cuff, sound ceases when blood flow returns to normal (diastolic).These measurements are used with an algorithm to determine the systolic and diastolic pressure in the arteries. This algorithm relies on the amplitude of the oscillations measured; therefore, it is pressure dependent, reducing the accuracy of the readings.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new set of algorithms for calculating systolic and diastolic pressures. These algorithms use the mean pressure instead of the maximum oscillation amplitude to provide more accurate results than current oscillometric devices. Advantages:-Minimal modification to existing devices-Improved accuracy of the readingsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Medical Devices-Biosensors"
Dithiocarbamate Ligands with Biosensing Applications,"The functionalization of metal substrates with organic ligands has become a standard practice in surface science and nanomaterials chemistry. Molecular monolayers are often formed spontaneously by a simple chemisorption process. The self-assembly of alkanethiols on gold is a method for preparing surfaces with tunable physical or chemical properties or with biological recognition elements. While such self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have proven to be very useful, they are also limited by their chemical stability. Thiols can be readily oxidized to disulfides, sulfinates, or sulfonates and desorb or be displaced from the surface by other molecules. Alkanethiol-based SAMs have been shown to lack the long-term stability necessary for most biomedical applications.Purdue University researchers have developed an innovative method for coating metal surfaces with dithiocarbamate (DTC) ligands. DTC ligands can absorb onto metal surfaces with the same degree of generality as thiols, but with greater resistance to surface desorption or displacement. DTC ligands can be formed under extremely mild conditions and are especially useful for robust functionalization of metal substrates and nanoparticles intended for biological labeling and biosensing applications. Advantages:-Can withstand a wide range of environments including a pH range of 1 to 12-Resistant to displacement by competing surfactants-Increased stability under physiological conditionsPotential Applications:-Biological Labeling-Biosensing"
Dual-Imaging In-Line Confocal Endoscope,"The endoscope has revolutionized the field of gastroenterology by allowing the physician to directly examine almost any part of the intestinal tract. Biopsies can be obtained, polyps removed, and clear images acquired. Endoscopes are employed as a routine clinical macroscopic examination tool for many diseases and gastrointestinal problems. Confocal microscopy is the most common method for producing high quality, optically sectioned microscopic images. However, there remains an unfilled need for an improved endoscopic system with the capability of conventional wide-field imaging and confocal microscopy simultaneously in a flexible endoscopic probe. This style of endoscope could make possible histological analysis of tissues with reduced need for biopsy in many cases, decreasing pain, time requirement, and cost to the patient. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an improved endoscope and accompanying software that offer the ability to image tissues in vivo on both a gross and cellular level. The user can then effectively select one area of interest in a macroscopic view and zoom in to view the cellular information from the same area. This may make possible an immediate histological identification without the need to surgically extract biopsy samples. It will also allow physicians to examine suspected tissues in a much more methodical and thorough method than is allowed with traditional biopsy. Advantages: -Ability to perform gross and cellular imaging simultaneously -Provides a fiducial link between both levels -Allows ability to zoom in on any desired gross feature -Ability to view fluorescently labeled cellsPotential Applications: -Medical/Health-Diagnostics"

A Lab-on-Chip Platform for Measuring Real-time Nondestructive Extracellular Matrix Stiffness,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method of in vitro measurement of extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness that is nondestructive and provides fast readout. ECM stiffness has recently been found to be a contributing factor in cancer or fibrotic disease development including cell differentiation and rapid cell multiplication. Current technologies used to measure ECM stiffness in vitro are often invasive and expensive as well as sometimes limited to detecting cell destruction only after detrimental cell deformations have already occurred. The approach fine-tuned by Purdue researchers is includes a noninvasive on-chip platform that monitors ultrasonic wave attenuation thereby noninvasively characterizing ECM stiffness with up to 93% accuracy. The new low-cost sensors can continuously detect dynamic changes in vitro for up to two days while maintaining thermal stability. The highly selective, biocompatible sensors can also be implemented in applications including drug screening, drug discovery, and 3D cell cultures.   Advantages:-Low cost -Nondestructive -Accurate -Thermal Stability -Mechanical StabilityPotential Applications:-Biomedical -Research -3D Cell Cultures -Drug Screening -Therapeutic Efficacy Monitoring Recent Publication:  A Lab-on-Chip Ultrasonic Platform for Real-Time and Nondestructive Assessment of Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Royal Society of Chemistry's Lab on a Chip Journal  DOI: 10.1039/C9LC00926D"
Thermally Activated Ultrasound Contrast Agents,"Researchers at Purdue University have created a new thermally activated ultrasound contrast agent composed of nanodroplets. Unlike current technologies, the contrast agent solution lasts in the body for days if not up to months. This advantage greatly enhances patient care by eliminating need for repeated use of contrast agents. Another problem with traditional typical gas-filled solutions is product loss, as heat in the body can pop the gas bubbles. The agent created by Purdue researchers is activated by heating it outside the body to ensure that it remains stable. In addition, nanodroplets in the new contrast agent can reach as far as endothelial cells for enhanced imaging, whereas traditional agents have not been able to produce high-resolution images. These nanodroplets can be labeled for a variety of biomedical applications, as well, including tumor detection and tracking cells.Advantages:-Stable-Long Lasting -Heat Activated -Easy to LabelPotential Applications:-Ultrasound Imaging -Drug Delivery -Tumor Detection -Tracking Cells"
High Throughput Cancer Treatment Screening with Magnetic Actuation Platform,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a biomimetic platform using magnetic actuators for in vitro cell seeding. The setup is compatible with multi-well plates and allows for high throughput, thereby reducing the time needed to develop targeted cancer therapies. Cancer treatment screening typically involves use of a synthetic polymer-based substrate, which leads to undesired defects in cell cultures. These polymer substrates are controlled by electromechanical forces that do not accurately replicate natural cell environments. However, Purdue researchers have used magnetic actuators that are adaptable in both amplitude and frequency to apply specific strain that accurately suspends cells over a gap between actuators. In testing with 18,000 cells, within 24 hours a cell culture was ready to be studied. The system allows researchers and medical professionals to capture dynamic physiological conditions in 3D.Advantages:-Biomimetic-Enhanced cancer therapy-High throughputPotential Applications:-Cancer screening-Microbiology-Tissue engineering"
Pupillometer with Direct and Consensual Pupillary Reflex Measurement and Disease Classification,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new pupillometer for detecting sensory and motor function in the brain. The highly sensitive pupillometer can evaluate activity in the optic nerve and oculomotor nerve as well as conduct stem assessment. In addition, the device uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to compare results with a deep learning database to pinpoint lesions. Currently, pupillometers are only adapted to check one eye at a time, but often there can be damage to a consensual reflex that goes unnoticed. Purdue researchers have fine-tuned their pupillometer to feature a telecentric lens that enhances biodynamic image acquisition and thereby allows optometrists to obtain highly accurate measurements for reliable diagnostics. In addition, researchers integrate an invisible infrared light source instead of traditional visible light to prevent artifacts from appearing in one's vision.Advantages:-Accurate-Fast image acquisitionPotential Applications:-Optometry-Health Monitoring"
Fluorescent Probes for Monitoring Serine Ubiquitination by Bacterial Enzymes,"Purdue University researchers have developed a fluorometric assay for real-time monitoring of ubiquitination events catalyzed by bacterial SidE enzymes in Legionella infections. The assay is well suited for high-throughput identification of Legionella infection inhibitors. The enzymes of the Legionella SidE family catalyze host protein ubiquitination events via a recently discovered mechanism distinct from ubiquitination by eukaryotic enzymes and are required for optimal Legionella infection. Contemporary methods to investigate the ubiquitination activity of SidEs include mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE gel shift assays. These current techniques are not continuous, only measuring the end point of the reaction, and are not amenable to high throughput formats. Purdue researchers synthesized a fluorescently labelled synthetic substrate peptide for SdeA, a member of the SidE family, that displays a change in fluorescence polarization when ubiquitinated by the enzyme. This technology is amendable to high throughput screening and will assist in discovery of inhibitors for Legionella infection as well as identifying and characterizing SidE-like enzymes in other bacterial species. Advantages:-Real-Time SidE Ubiquitination Analysis-Amenable to High Throughput ScreeningPotential Applications:-Legionella Research-Investigating Ubiquitination Events-Fluorescence PolarizationRelated Publication: Fluorescent Probes for Monitoring Serine Ubiquitination Biochemistry 2020, 59, 13, 1309–1313 ​https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00067"
CAFs are a leading reason for ineffective cancer treatments,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for making drug conjugates through antifibrotic ligand-targeting. Currently, Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) tend to progressively resist pharmacotherapies. CAFs are responsible for spontaneous cell motility, growth of tumors, and often cancer relapse in patients. Aiming to provide sensitive patient care, the Purdue University drug conjugate reduces immunosuppression and chemoresistance. The drug can be used for treating fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, wounds, and cancers. Epithelial carcinomas can now be detected non-invasively, and when tested in mice ninety-eight percent of fibroblast cells were accurately detected. In addition, this conjugate-based method can be used to prevent and treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis disease, which remains untreated in one hundred twenty-eight thousand people.Advantages:-Ligand-targeted -Enhanced pharmacotherapy-Precise identification of tumor microenvironmentsPotential Applications:-Imaging for cancer and inflammatory diseases-Cancer therapy"
Water Soluble Human Calcitonin for Treatment of Osteoporosis and Calcium-related Disorders,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a prodrug form of the peptide hormone, human calcitonin, to increase its effectiveness as an osteoporosis treatment. In humans, calcitonin is the hormone responsible for normal calcium homeostasis. When prescribed to osteoporosis patients, calcitonin inhibits bone resorption resulting in increased bone mass. Unfortunately, human calcitonin undergoes fibrillation in aqueous solution leading to reduced efficacy when used as a therapeutic. As a substitute, osteoporosis patients are prescribed salmon calcitonin which does not fibrillate as rapidly but suffers from low potency and immunotoxicity. To decrease the fibrillation propensity and increase the therapeutic benefit of human calcitonin, Purdue researchers phosphorylated specific amino acid residues. This modification's ability to inhibit fibril formation was validated in comparison to the unphosphorylated calcitonin through thioflavin T- fluorescence, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and circular dichroism. This prodrug approach will increase the therapeutic potential of human calcitonin, promising a more effective option to replace salmon calcitonin for osteoporosis and related disorders.Advantages:-Stable solution of human calcitonin-Higher potency than salmon calcitonin-Less toxicity than salmon calcitoninPotential Applications:-Drug Development-Osteoporosis Treatment-Hypercalcemia Treatment"
Human Monoclonal Folate Receptor Beta Antibody,"Folic acid is a vitamin required for the synthesis of DNA nucleotide bases and is essential for proliferation of all cells. To take in folic acid, some cells express a folate receptor that binds folic acid very tightly and carries it into the cell via endocytosis. There are four types of folate receptors: alpha; beta; gamma; delta, and these receptors are preferentially overexpressed on cancer cells.  Purdue University researchers have developed a method for using a human monoclonal antibody against beta folate receptors. By targeting cancer cells and binding antibodies to the beta folate receptors on those cells, researchers can block some of the beta folate receptors on the cells. This lowers the amount of folic acid the cancer cell is receiving and prevents its rapid proliferation. By attaching chemical groups to the antibody, e.g. therapeutics or imaging agents, this approach can be used to potentially treat or identify cancers. It is particularly useful for targeting of chronic and acute leukemia, and has potential to treat these disorders, along with immunological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Advantages:-Lowers the amount of folic acid cancer cells take in-Potential cancer treatment-Also treats inflammatory disorders"
Tool to Identify Host Proteins Involved in Viral and Bacterial Pathogenesis,"Purdue researchers have developed a chemical probe to facilitate quantitative proteomic analysis of potential drug targets for infectious diseases, identifying interactions between infectious particles and host proteins. Pathogens rely on their host's cells to proliferate and must bind to host cellular components. The weak and often transient nature of these interactions make capturing these interactions difficult due to harsh measures available to isolate such interactions. To aid in mitigating the high false positive rate brought about by these contemporary methods, Purdue researchers have synthesized chemical probes to label bacteria or virus particles that crosslink with interacting host proteins during infection. The probe contains a modifiable isolation tag to allow for identification of host proteins through mass spectrometry. The researchers have demonstrated this technology by isolating host proteins that directly interact with Salmonella and Zika virus, which might be critical for their pathogenesis. This method could serve as a universal tool to map the entry pathway of other pathogens.Related Publication:Tracking Pathogen Infections by Time-Resolved Chemical ProteomicsAngewandte Chemie, Feb 2020, Vol.132(6), pp.2255-2260DOI: 10.1002/anie.201911078Advantages:-Able to identify previously unknown protein interactions-High throughputPotential Applications:-Drug development-Viral and bacterial pathogenesis research"
Electrochemical Detection Device for COVID-19 in Saliva,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a wireless biosensor that contains DNA primers for nCOVID-19 in order to rapidly and non-invasively test for the virus in patient saliva. Current technology for nCOVID-19 testing is often invasive, is not efficient, or involves testing for antibody activity rather than viral strands. The platform created by Purdue researchers features an inkjet-printed gold electrode that allows for communication with a software application so that electronic readout can be conducted on-site. The electrochemical device has been evaluated in-lab at Purdue University with a library of nCOVID-19 DNA primers to achieve distinction between nCOVID-19, the flu, and other viruses for enhanced detection.Advantages:-Rapid -On-site -Accurate -WirelessPotential Applications:-Biomedical -Sensors"
Activity-Based Probes with Unnatural Amino Acids to Monitor the Proteasome in Living Cells,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a set of activity-based probes which have shown improved fluorescence properties and selectivity towards the proteasome compared to other cellular proteases.  They have included unnatural amino acids and have found probes which can be utilized in various applications, including monitoring the effects of small molecule stimulators of the proteasome in live cells and comparing the relative proteasome activity across different cancer cell types. Advantages:-Improved Proteasome Sensitivity-Cell-Based Assay CompatibilityPotential Applications:-High throughput assays-Finding Proteasome Stimulators and Inhibitors"
Small Molecule Proteasome Stimulators of Proteasome for Protein Degradation to Treat Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases ,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed small molecule stimulators of the enzyme responsible for routine protein degradation, the 20S core particle of the proteasome (20S CP). The researchers were motivated to develop 20S CP stimulators as a pharmaceutical intervention to degrade the damaged and disordered proteins associated with a variety of disease states including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The hit compound discovered by Purdue's researchers stimulates catalytic activity of the 20S CP. This stimulator molecule increased the degradation of a peptide probe as well as several full-length proteins by the 20S CP versus a control without the stimulator. In a cell line expressing alpha-synuclein, a protein found aggregated in neurodegenerative diseases, the stimulator enhanced degradation of this protein 200-300 percent. The researchers are now developing derivatives of the hit compound towards a new therapeutic lead. These new molecules pave the way for a drug to prevent debilitating and life-threatening diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.Advantages:-Stimulates 20S core of the proteasome-Selective for 20S CP versus 26S proteasomePotential Applications-Treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases-Treatment for aging and disease processes associated with protein aggregation"
Biological Sensing and Actuation Using CMOS SOI Microelectrode Arrays,"Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are devices that serve as neural interfaces, connecting neural signals to electronic circuitry. Current MEAs are not fabricated in a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) platform; therefore, they suffer from low yield and low sensitivity and require packaging to bring the lead out. The CMOS version of MEA is not flexible and still requires packaging.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a highly-flexible microelectrode array built on a complementary metal oxide semiconductor chip that senses live cells, neurons, and live tissues. This technology not only improves the yield and sensitivity, it brings the advantages of CMOS integration, e.g., wireless link and wireless powering. It can be used on concave and pulsating and moving tissues and cells, such as a retina. The technology will make it possible to achieve a single-cell characterization platform, cochlea implant, wireless retina, neural recording devices, and nerve connectors to mend severed peripheral nerves. Advantages:-Highly flexible-Low noise and high fidelity-Wireless link and wireless poweringPotential Applications:-Cochlea implants-Wireless neural prosthetic such as retina implant or wireless neural recording devices"
Adjustable Hearing Aid with Frequency Compression for Clear Speech Perception,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed an algorithm that establishes parameters for audio signals in hearing aids based on a patient's severity of hearing loss. The ability to distinguish between high and low frequencies allows for faster user response, easing every day conversations as well as patient lifestyles. Hearing aids have been adapted to lower frequency through Hybrid Expansive Frequency Compression (hEFC) methods; however, hEFC technology often confuses between high and low frequencies. In addition, hEFC based systems cannot filter background noise and rarely recognize soft sounds like frication. Often, individuals with high frequency hearing loss will start to rely on memory of sounds, which leads to misidentification of phonemes. Purdue University has integrated new technology into hearing aids that keeps different sounds separate and enhances fricatives, affricates, and stop constant barriers. Advantages:-Faster signal time-Eliminates need for frequency remapping -Identifies spectral prominence of sound Potential Applications:-Hearing aids -Assistive biotechnology"
Optical Detection of Pathogen Interaction with Immortal Cell Line,"Finding biological pathogens requires recovery, concentration, and interrogation of small numbers of pathogenic bacteria. Current technologies face practical limitations, particularly in rapidly determining phenotypes of small numbers of isolated microorganisms. Conventional methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genomic technologies, enrichment, and molecular recognition require several limitations and sometimes do not offer solid results. These approaches do not enable the rapid detection of unknown pathogens.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method to rapidly detect the presence of unknown pathogens using an immortal cell line as a sensitive detector. This method is better than conventional methods because it is more sensitive, rapid, and is able to detect unknown pathogenic bacteria. The method can also be used to detect food pathogens such as Listeria and Salmonella. Advantages: -Detects unknown pathogenic bacteria-Sensitive-RapidPotential Applications: -Food safety-Biosecurity"
Purification of Elastin-like Polypeptides by Organic Solvent Extraction ,"Protein purification is being increasingly used in a variety of ways, mostly in biomedical applications.  They have beneficial physicochemical properties.  The current method of purification is very labor intensive.  It also results in yield loss and contamination.  The required temperature for this method is very high which is what causes the yield loss during the process.  This current method also takes hours to complete which is very time consuming.  Sense it takes so much time to complete, it is not very cost effective either.  There is a need for a new method of protein purification that is more efficient overall.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that makes protein purification more efficient.  This new method is faster than the current method.  This method takes only about 30 minutes compared to hours with the current method.  Also, this method does not cause loss of yield during the process because it requires a much lower temperature.  Another thing is this method causes much less contamination of the protein during the process.  All of these things allow this new process to be much more efficient than the current method. Advantages: -Faster than current method-High yield-Creates less contaminationPotential Applications: -Polypeptide purification-Organic solvent extractionRelated Publications:Ross VerHeul, Craig Sweet and David H. Thompson, Rapid and simple purification of elastin-like polypeptides directly from whole cells and cell lysates by organic solvent extraction. Biomater. Sci., 2018, 6, 863DOI: 10.1039/c8bm00124c"
Faster and More Controlled RF Heating for Lyophilization Based on Statistical Electromagnetics,"Researcher at Purdue University have created a high power Radio Frequency Heating method that is controllable and optimal through statistical electromagnetism. Frequencies are selected based on type of material, frozen bulk is then uniformly heated volumetrically, and heat energy is distributed uniformly. The novel setup saves time, reduces energy consumption in the lyophilization process, and creates a product loss factor of less than one tenth for organic constituents. The advanced RF technique features an additional abrupt turn-off option for precise control of heating, relieving any need to adjust time, temperature, pressure, or shelf layouts for vials to obtain better results. Freeze drying can become considerably more efficient for pharmaceutical manufacturing and developing biotechnology.Advantages:-Heating uniformity -Selective heating within chamber -Less product loss -Saves time-Abrupt turn off feature   Potential Applications:-Pharmaceutical drug manufacturing-Biotechnology development-Food industry/freeze drying meats, coffee, etc."
Regulation of Plant Nodulation by Rhizobial tRNA-Derived Small RNAs,"Nitrogen-fixation is often the limiting factor for plant growth and crop yield, because nodulation is hindered by inefficient interactions between Rhizobial bacteria and plants. This technology uses tRNA-derived small RNAs to increase root hair curling and nodule number in legumes. Through gene editing of plants with the tRNA-derived small RNAs, the number of productive Rhizobial infections is dramatically increased. Genetic engineering of plants to promote nodulation has applications in enhancing nitrogen-fixation in legumes and in extending nitrogen fixation capabilities to non-legumes.Advantages:-Improved nitrogen fixation-Lower cost of inputsPotential Applications: -Engineering plants to improve nitrogen fixation"
Reporter Molecule for Study of Alzheimer's Disease,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed pH-dependent fluorogenic amyloid-beta reporters for the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglial phagocytosis of amyloid-beta peptides is a critical step in the regulation of brain homeostasis during the initiation and progression of AD. Unlike common methods to study this phenomenon, this technology is specific for amyloid-beta and functions in live cells. The reporter, an isoform of human amyloid-beta tagged with a pH-dependent fluorogenic moiety, fluoresces only upon phagocytosis in the acidic intracellular phagosomes. It clearly differentiates between phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells within live human and nonhuman microglial cells. This technology promises to aid in the discovery of new therapeutics for AD.Advantages: -Facilitates live cell tracking of microglial phagocytosis-Differentiates between phagocytic and non-phagocytic microglial cellsPotential Applications: -Development of Alzheimer's Therapeutics"
An Antibody for the Detection of Protein Levels in Bacterial Cells,"Scientific experiments rely upon conditions being the same across all trials except for the variable being tested. This can be difficult in a microbiological setting due to the very nature of microorganisms, specifically bacteria. With bacteria being so small, it is virtually impossible to acquire a specific count of the total bacteria involved in an experiment. This problem is usually addressed with the use of components of stable complex or other cell components, which are not reliable.Researchers at Purdue University have invented a new method of comparing the number of bacteria in experiments. The solution is based around the development of an antibody against the bacterial metabolic enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH). The antibody can recognize ICDH from a wide range of bacteria, including both gram positive and gram negative types. This will allow scientists in numerous research fields to get more accurate initial bacteria counts, which will improve experiment setups."
In vitro Model for Testing Efficacy and Neurotoxicity of Neurotherapeutic,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a physiologically relevant in vitro screening tool combining blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability testing with subsequent neuronal response to evaluate the effects of permeation on observed neuroactivity in one assay. Clinical translation of neurotheraputics significantly lags behind the rapid increase in neurological disorders seen worldwide. One of the primary hurdles to neurotherapeutic development is the blood brain barrier (BBB). Others have developed in vitro assays to emulate the BBB; however, the result of these assays does not translate to real efficacy, because the assays do not incorporate downstream neuroactivity or associated neurotoxicity as the Purdue technology does. Preliminary tests of the Purdue technology revealed it correctly rank-orders compounds compared to known parameters. The technology is versatile and can be adapted to utilize multiple cell types. The technology promises to reduce the resources needed for ranking hit and lead candidate compounds in the development of new neurotheraputic agents.Advantages-Promises to reduce time and cost associated with pharmaceutical development-Flexible system: adaptable to multiple cell types-Increased translational efficiencyPotential Applications-Neurotherapeutic drug development-Drug Discovery and Development"
Technique for Engineering Centimeter-size Model Tumors,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method that produces in vitro tumors in the centimeter-size range with relevant pathological traits. In contrast, current in vitro 3D cultures or ""microtumors"" typically yield cell aggregates less than 800 microns in size. Although these microtumors successfully mimic cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions observed in vivo, tumors in that size range are rarely detected in the clinic. Further, large engineered tumors produced by aggregation begin to die within a few hours. Larger, more stable in vitro models with clinically relevant architecture and cell phenotypes would be more relevant for testing drug delivery systems and other potential therapies. Bioprinting has been applied to the creation of large multicellular tumors that are reproducible and finely controllable; however, bioprinting requires high levels of expertise and access to expensive equipment. Using a simpler process, the Purdue researchers' tumors remain viable for weeks and have traits relevant to the clinical phenotype, including a heterogeneous composition consisting of both preinvasive and invasive phenotypes and a structure allowing for adequate diffusion of nutrients both within the construct and to an exogenous extracellular matrix.Advantages: -Large tumors with clinically relevant phenotype-Tumors can survive several days (even weeks)-Does not require access to a bioprinter or training on how to use a bioprinterPotential Applications:-Evaluation of drug delivery systems or other proposed therapies"
Quantitative Sensor to Measure Cellular Metabolism,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a protein-based, genetically-encoded bioluminescent sensor that can report changes in intracellular ATP in live cells.  This new sensor could be very useful for research purposes in cancer biology to measure cell health and chemotherapeutic drug efficacy.   Advantages:-Measurement is independent of bioluminescence decay -Precisely quantifies cell health and metabolismPotential Applications:-High throughput drug discovery -Life animal imaging"
Liquid Biopsy for Determining Breast Cancer Subtypes,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method that can differentiate cancer subtypes and aid in early detection for breast cancer. Early diagnosis and identification of the disease may permit earlier intervention and treatment and more successful outcomes for patients. Blood testing aka ""liquid biopsy"" for early diagnosis and monitoring of cancer is highly attractive; however, the number and complexity of various proteins in the blood makes the identification of appropriate diagnostic markers a serious challenge. This innovation reduces the complexity of the liquid biopsy samples. Extracellular vesicles, membrane encapsulated particles whose contents are protected from enzymes in the blood, are isolated from the blood and used as a source of biomarkers. This technology isolates extracellular vesicles from a patient sample and analyzes their contents to differentiate breast cancer subtypes. With knowledge of the specific breast cancer subtype, doctors can better tailor treatment for the patient. Advantages:-Differentiate cancer subtypes-Allows for tailored treatmentPotential Applications:-Breast cancer diagnosis-Subtype identification"
Engineering NK Cells to Treat Cancers Driven by Adenosine Immunosuppression,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a cell therapy capable of exerting a cytotoxic effect on CD73 expressing cancer cells. Adenosine immunosuppression is a regulatory mechanism of the immune system that protects against autoimmunity. However, this mechanism also drives cancers that express the enzyme, CD73. This enzyme produces adenosine, a molecule that inhibits immune cells. The Purdue technology circumvents this adenosine-mediated immunosuppression to treat cancer.Purdue's researchers engineered a type of immune cell, the natural killer (NK) cell, to target and kill cancer cells. The cells are engineered to express a protein consisting of an extracellular CD73 antibody fragment for targeting and an intracellular signaling domain that activates the NK cell to destroy the cancer cell. This potential therapy circumvents adenosine immunosuppression in the solid tumor microenvironment, selectively targeting cancer cells with engineered immune cells. The engineered NK cells have been successfully tested against glioblastoma cell lines and in vivo in lung carcinoma models, supporting this technology as a transformative cancer treatment to effectively target solid tumors. Advantages-Selective cancer therapeutic-NK cell mediated cytotoxicityPotential Applications-Cancer therapeutic-Circumvent adenosine immunosuppression"
Microwave Assisted Freeze Drying,"Primary drying is the most critical and time-consuming step in the lyophilization process used widely in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. To achieve minimal product loss, common practice is to optimize the recipe (time, temperature, and pressure) in each step of the lyophilization process, which wastes time unnecessarily. Purdue researchers have developed a technology that uses microwave assisted heating in place of conventional heating. It allows for precise heating control of the frozen substance, including the ability to apply heat energy to specific locations inside the lyophilization chamber. Advantages: -Precise tuning of heating properties-Selective heating of specific locations-Faster processing timePotential Applications: -Pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry-Food industry"
Highly Potent HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors,"There is a need to develop new treatments for patients living with HIV-1, as HIV-1 rapidly acquires resistance to treatment options. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Compared to darunavir, a leading FDA approved drug, these compounds were 100 times more potent in cell culture. Additionally, the compounds have improved metabolic stability over previous protease inhibitors. The primary application for these compounds is for the treatment of multidrug-resistant HIV-1. Advantages: -Improved potency against HIV-1-Improved pharmacokinetic propertiesPotential Applications: -HIV/AIDS treatment"
Surfaces Self-disinfect Using Built-in UV Lighting,"Decontamination via UV light is used on surfaces and water. The use of UV light as a disinfectant is popular in hospitals when it comes to cleaning surfaces unable to sustain chemicals. Additionally, chemicals are expensive and dangerous; there is also an economical and safety benefit. There is no record of any bacteria showing resistance to this method. However, for the process to be successful, the lighting source has to be a within a certain distance of the surface. Due to the size of the source, it is difficult to be in close proximity; this decreases the amount of power received by the surface and increases the potential of the shadow effect. The shadow effect is one of the main issues with the current approach. If anything is blocking the light from reaching the surface (causing a shadow), then that part of the surface will not be disinfected. The need is a solution to the shadow effect.Researchers at Purdue University developed a new approach to disinfection using UV light which eliminates the shadow effect, requires less power, and eliminates the current bulky light sources. The shadow effect is eliminated when the UV-light source exists in the surface, itself. Additionally, more space becomes available when extra equipment is no longer required. Initially, such changes would have the greatest impact on hospitals and water decontamination. However, this could eventually minimize the use of chemicals in general.    Advantages: -The entire surface area is covered-Requires less power-More space becomes available since additional equipment (lighting) is no longer requiredPotential Applications: -Disinfection of surface areas-Disinfection of water"
Plant Virus-Like Particles as Biotemplates for Nanoparticle Synthesis,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed plant virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from Barley-Stripe Mosaic Virus that can be used as biotemplates for synthesizing nanoparticles. The VLPs can be easily genetically modified to tune their size and shape prior to metal deposition. The researchers found that the VLPs adsorb twice as much metal as VLPs compared to Tobacco Mosaic Virus, allowing for thicker coatings and unique nanosynthesis opportunities. Furthermore, the VLPs have a unique region that is surface-exposed and can be engineered for additional desired properties, such as accelerated deposition rate. The applications for these VLPs is in the miniaturization of electronic devices, such as in battery electrodes. Advantages: -	Uniform nanomaterial -	Twice amount of metal adsorbed compared to Tobacco Mosaic -	Environmentally-friendly Potential Applications: -	Battery electrodes -	Small electronic devices"
Liposomal Carriers with High Drug Loading Capacity,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for encapsulating drugs in liposomes with higher efficiency than competing methods. Liposomal encapsulation of chemotherapeutic agents is widely used to reduce nonspecific side effects, because liposomes will preferentially target the tumor's leaky vasculature. Liposomes are typically loaded with drugs using pH gradients. However, some drugs, such as gemcitabine, a first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer, have proven difficult to load into liposomes with reasonable efficiency. In a proof-of-concept study using this new method, gemcitabine had a loading efficiency of 9.4 - 10.3 wt% compared to 0.14 - 3.8 wt% by conventional methods. Applications for this technology include in the development of novel drug formulations for the treatment of cancer.Advantages: -Higher drug loading efficiency-Good stability and sustained release of drugPotential Applications: -Pharmaceutical formulations"
High Sensitivity Glutamate Biosensor,"Glutamate excitotoxicity (GE) is a dynamic process by which neurons are damaged due to excessive amount of glutamate in the cell. It is hypothesized by scientists that glutamate excitotoxicity is a secondary injury that can occur after spinal cord injury (SCI). The limited knowledge of the role of glutamate in secondary injury has limited the development of therapeutics for GE. In 2016, the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center reported 300,000 people currently live with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States. SCI is a debilitating illness that often leaves patients with limited mobility. The lifetime healthcare cost per patient can range from $1,200,000 to $5,000,000 per patient. Current bioanalytical techniques such as nuclear resonance imaging have low spatiotemporal resolution and poor sensitivity for determining glutamate levels. Since glutamate excitotoxicity is dynamic in nature and can progress over time, it is crucial that the glutamate diagnostic tools possess high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity of glutamate.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a biosensor with superior sensitivity for measuring glutamate levels in hopes to better understand GE. In in vitro studies, it was found that the newly developed biosensor exhibited 6 times higher glutamate sensitivity in comparison to glutamate biosensors fabricated in other labs. The biosensor had high selectivity for glutamate with a detection limit 14 µM. Advantages: -	Superior sensitivity for glutamate-	High selectivity for glutamate-	Simplify process of measuring glutamatePotential Applications: -	Glutamate biosensor"
Smartphone-Based Device for Bioluminescence Detection,"Smartphone cameras have uses beyond the usual photos taken for social media apps. There are potential applications in searching for biological matter in environmental surveys and on-site food safety inspections. However, for widespread usage of smartphone-based detection, there is a bottleneck of low sensitivity associated with the sensor of a standard commercial smartphone. Other methods, such as sending actual samples to a laboratory for analysis using high sensitivity detectors, delay the results and impose economic losses in cases of food inspection.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a smartphone-based device and image processing method to maximize the sensitivity of the typical smartphone camera. The proposed hardware/software combination, named the ""Bioluminescent-based Analyte Quantitation by Smartphone (BAQS),"" provides a quick, on-site method for analysis of samples tagged with a bioluminescent probe. A structure houses the smartphone, sample, and collection lens, while an algorithm lowers the signal background and enhances the signal from bioluminescent photons. Advantages:-Simple & inexpensive-Achieves large increases in detection-On-site; no delays in sending samples to labsPotential applications:-Environmental surveying-Food inspection"
Liposomal Formulation of Combinational Antibiotics,Liposomal formulations have been developed for single drugs such as ciprofloxacin but not for combinational antibiotics. Liposomal formulations have shown significant less irritation to the respiratory tract and much better safety in previous clinical trials. Developing liposomal formulations for combinational antibiotics might be beneficial for the treatment of respiratory infections.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new liposomal formulation of combinational antibiotics for the treatment of respiratory infections. This new formulation incorporates two synergistic antibiotics to enable maximum bacteria killing against resistant pathogens while significantly reducing irritation to the respiratory tract.Advantages: -Maximum bacteria killing against resistant pathogens-Reduce resistance developmentPotential Applications: -Treatment of respiratory infections-Eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Antibacterial Agents Against Methicillin- and Vancomycin-Resistant Bacteria,"The discovery and development of antibiotics revolutionized health care in such a way that bacterial infections, which were otherwise deadly, could be treated; however, this was met with a rapid development of resistant bacterial strains that rendered many antibiotics ineffective. Consequently, millions of people are infected with drug-resistant bacterial strains yearly resulting in thousands of deaths. Efforts need to be directed towards identifying and developing novel structures as antibacterial agents with possibly novel mechanisms of action.Researchers at Purdue University have identified compounds with potent antibacterial activities. The most potent compounds inhibited growth of various-resistant Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Some compounds were active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA and VRSA respectively), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). Through resistance generation experiments it was revealed that MRSA could not develop resistance to one of these compounds.Advantages: -Compounds can kill methicillin and vancomycin-resistant bacteria-No resistance from MRSA-Potent activity against drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens	Potential Applications: -Pharmaceuticals/biotech companies-Animal medicine-Bacterial burden in skin wound infectionsRelated Publications:Clement Opoku-Temeng et al., N-(1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzamide analogs, bacteriostatic agents against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant bacteriaEuropean Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2018https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.06.023"
"Live Cell Conjugation Chemistry for Imaging, Sensing, Biomanufacturing, and Cell Therapy","Surface modification of live cells has many biomedical and therapeutic applications, such as live cell imaging and cell therapy. The current approaches have limitations including poor stability over time and incompatibility with mammalian cells due to toxicity. There is a need for a new technology that improves surface modification of live cells. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that enables surface modification of live mammalian cells. This cell-modification technology has applications in live cell imaging, manufacturing of cell therapies, enhancement of cells for therapeutic applications, cell-drug conjugation for enhanced killing of cancer cells, and drug delivery in a pH dependent manner to sites of inflammation. This technology conjugates small molecules, proteins, fluorophores, and PET tracers to live cells without nanoparticles or other vehicles.Advantages: -Conjugation to cell membranes without killing cells -Functionalizes living cells with components such as small molecules, proteins, fluorophores, and PET tracers -No use of nanoparticles or other vehicles Potential Applications: -Cell membrane imaging -Enhanced cell therapy-Production of therapeutic cells"
DNA-Guided Gene Editing Tools,Gene editing has been a much sought after and very controversial technology.  Clustered Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is the current widely known gene editing technology.  The problem with this current technology is it restricted to targeting regions adjacent to a specific motif.  Another issue with CRISPR is that it can cause mutations throughout the genome.  This problem accounts for one of the reasons that gene editing is such a controversial topic.  There is a need for a new gene editing technology that could potentially solve these controversial issues.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology pertaining to gene editing.  This new method consists of Argonaute from Natronbacterium gregoryi or its mutants that target the enzyme to cleave specific regions of a chromosome or other extra chromosomal genetic material.  The DNA guides are designed as 24 nucleotides complementary to a gene of interest.  This technology reduces random cleavage and may be used for targeting gene editing.  This new technology could open the door for how gene editing is approached in the future. Advantages: -More flexible-Not restricted to certain regionsPotential Applications: -Gene editing-Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes
Therapeutics for Triple Negative Breast Cancer,"More than 200,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States.  The most aggressive type of breast cancer, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), disproportionately affects young premenopausal women of African-American or Hispanic descent. Chemotherapy remains the only treatment for TNBC; however, chemotherapy does not specifically target cancer cells, causing debilitating side effects. A new, targeted therapy is needed to treat TNBC without adverse effects. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that could change how breast cancer is treated. The researchers have developed new drug candidates that are potent at lower concentrations than chemotherapy. The technology employs molecules that are selectively taken up by cancer cells and activated by light. In vitro, this therapeutic drug is photoactive at the nanomolar range with an appropriate light dose adjustment and has no observable toxicity when not exposed to light. This targeted therapy promises to reduce the dosage of drug needed to treat TNBC and effectively reduce side effects. Advantages: -Reduced adverse effects-Targeted therapy -Potent at low concentrations Potential Applications: -Breast cancer -Cancer therapeuticsRelated Publication:Photodynamic Activity of Vitamin-Chlorin Conjugates at Nanomolar Concentrations against Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsACS Omega 2019, 4, 2, 2907-2920DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.8b02323"
Smartphone-Based Device for Monitoring Chemical Pollutants in Water,"Enhanced frequency in monitoring water-borne pollutants is important to curbing inadvertent consumption of contaminated water. Conventional analytical instruments, such as atomic absorption fluorescent spectrometer and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, are not amenable for such frequent monitoring needs given the high cost to purchase and maintain, require highly-trained personnel, and delicate sample handling and transportation. There is need for an inexpensive method for on-site monitoring of water-borne pollutants more easily. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a smartphone-based device for monitoring target contaminants in water samples. Water containing target ions react with specific colorimetric reagent, yielding colorimetric analytes, which vary in intensity as the concentration of the target ion changes. This technology puts into consideration, the complete and composite undulations in the image properties of the analyte under investigation. This relationship formed the basis for the development of an algorithm utilized in the smartphone based monitoring device with the capability of recalibration in the event of a change in device or lighting condition. The ease of operation, ubiquity, robust algorithm, cost effectiveness, and novel approach in this technology is noteworthy, especially with the fast assay time. Advantages: -Uses a smartphone-User friendly-Cost effective-Widely available-Easy to operate-Fast resultsPotential Applications: -Industries that deal with pollutants-Wastewater Treatment Plants-Drinking Water Treatment Plants-Municipalities,-State and Federal Environmental Protection Agencies-World Health Organization"
Crops with Increased Resistance to Fungal Disease,"Fungal disease is a major challenge in crop production. Sorghum is an important food crop in Africa and parts of Asia. In the United States, sorghum is used primarily for livestock feed and ethanol production. Recently, the United States has seen an increase in Sorghum's use as food given it is gluten-free. Anthracnose is the leading global disease of sorghum. While anthracnose resistant germplasm is available, specific resistance regulators and mechanisms of function have not been determined. There is a need to identify these fungal resistance mechanisms used by sorghum plants and exploit such mechanisms to generate broad-spectrum resistance in the plant.Researchers at Purdue University have identified a gene that could improve disease resistance in crops susceptible to disease. It confers broad-spectrum and complete resistance in sorghum and other plants, such as wheat, barley, rice, maize, oats, rye, or millet. Genome editing directly in improved and adapted cultivars to generate broad-spectrum resistance will considerably shorten the breeding cycle and make it possible to determine the precise means of regulation. This gene will be useful in generating disease resistant plants.Advantages: -Reliable fungal resistance -Shortened breeding cycle-Breeding disease-resistant plants-Reduced crop lossPotential Applications: -Crop producers-Agricultural companies-Seed companies"
EGF-Targeted Bladder Cancer Therapeutic,"The American Cancer Society (ACS) annually issues estimates for new cancer diagnoses and cancer deaths. For 2016, ACS estimates for bladder cancer is 76,960 new diagnoses and 16,390 deaths. Bladder cancer is the fourth and eleventh most common cancer in men and women respectively. The average age at diagnosis is 73 and 90 percent of patients are over the age 55. It is estimated that the annual national cost of bladder cancer care will reach $5.25 billion in 2020. Approximately 70 percent of newly diagnosed patients suffer disease recurrence after surgical treatment and more than 20 percent develop invasive bladder cancer. There is a need to develop efficient therapeutic strategies against this pathology.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a therapeutic strategy using a modified bacterial toxin to target the EGF receptor and destroy bladder cancer cells. This agent proved to be superior due to its specificity and high efficacy at eliminating cancer cells, taking only minutes for treatment with enhanced safety. In animal studies, there were no toxic side effects and it was very effective against treatment-resistant tumors in dogs.  Advantages:-Non-surgical treatment option-Treatment takes minutes vs. hours-Promising results in animal studiesPotential Applications:-Bladder cancer treatment"
Open Gradient Exposure Platform for Cell Culture,"The tissue microenvironment plays a role in normal development and disease and led to the exploration of cell culture approaches to integrate controlled microenvironmenal conditions by scientists. The production of chemicals, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), is frequent in the microenvironment and may lead to oxidative stress, which is present in several pathologies including metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. To assess the impact of ROS on cells requires the measurement of the oxidative DNA damage inside the cells and levels of expression of antioxidant proteins. ROS also triggers changes in nuclear morphology, which is important for the control of cell behavior, including the aggressiveness of cancer cells. For instance, progression from preinvasive to invasive cancer depends on local microenvironmental conditions; hence, the level of ROS might be critical in order to reach a threshold leading to progression switch for certain types of cancers. Therefore, a cell culture system that enables assessing, in the same culture sample, the impact of ROS delivered as a gradient might help sort out relationships among ROS-induced cellular injury, cellular protective response to oxidative stress, and developing phenotypic changes revealed by nuclear morphology.Purdue University researchers have developed an open gradient exposure platform for creating a gradient of a chemical and/or testing the dose-dependent impact of a chemical, e.g., toxin, drug, ion, and on cells and tissues, by providing a lab-on-a-chip microenvironment. This platform allows for controlled chemical delivery through a paper microfluidic underlayer set up, enabling easy access and analysis of the response of cells and tissues due to the open chamber, unlike the closed microfluidic gradient systems. As a proof-of-concept, Purdue researchers have demonstrated with the gradient-on-a-chip that the level of ROS exposure significantly affects the extent of the cellular response, notably for nuclear morphology, a potential marker of phenotypic changes, and that a same cellular response occurs for different levels of ROS depending on extracellular matrix stiffness.  These results demonstrate the importance of threshold for the impact of a chemical depending on the initial tissue condition. Changes occurred after only four hours; the use of the gradient-on-a-chip in future studies over several days is possible. This platform progressively acquires a more comprehensive picture of the microenvironmental impact on the response to chemical exposure and is amenable for different cell culture conditions, e.g., standard 2D culture, 3D culture with different matrices.Advantages:-Measures the microenvironmental impact on the cellular response to chemical exposure-Measures dose-dependent impact of a chemical on cells-Allows for testing over longer time periods thanks to continuous renewal of the gradient and cell culture medium-Recreates chemical homogeneity or heterogeneity of a microenvironment in a controlled manner-Convenient for gathering cell cultures for additional processing since 2D and 3D cell cultures are done a paper substrate that can be easily handled-Allows for cell culture with liquid-air interface-Provides medium and chemicals from underneath the cells mimicking liquid diffusion to the cells-Easy to assemble, disassemble, and sterilizePotential Applications:-Pharmaceuticals R&D-study of microenvironmental exposure linked to disease risk, onset and progression, as well as microenvironmental conditions that influence tissue development"
Isolation of Adenovirus E1 Expressing Cell Lines and Strategies to Generate Adenovirus Recombinants,"Purdue University researchers have developed a technique for isolating cell lines with desired characteristics in the cell lines expressing adenovirus E1. Following adenovirus infection of a cell, E1 genes are the first viral genes expressed and are essential for virus replication. Therefore, the generation and growth of E1-deleted adenoviral vectors is possible only in a cell line that constitutively expresses E1 proteins. This technology involves the isolation of a number of cell lines expressing either human adenovirus (HAd) or bovine adenovirus (BAd) E1 genes. These isolated cell lines may be useful in generating and replicating adenovirus recombinants for vaccination and gene therapy applications.Advantages:-Better cell lines for propagating E1-deleted HAd or BAd-Simple generation of cell lines with specific characteristicsPotential Applications:-Gene therapy-Vaccines-Drug delivery"
Tannic Acid as a Functional Crosslinker in Polymer Systems,"Current epoxy crosslinkers are amine-based, which are not environmentally friendly. Upon epoxy degradation, the chemicals leech out into the environment. Tannic acid is a well-known, naturally occurring polyphenolic compound used in antioxidants and chelating agents. The study of tannic acid's use in a wide variety of polymer systems as a flame retardant additive is extensive; however, its use as a hardener/cross-linker in epoxy lacks research.  Researchers at Purdue University have developed a thermosetting polymeric composition by crosslinking epoxy by using tannic acid as the hardener. Tannic acid is a more sustainable crosslinker, has less environmental impact, and is inexpensive given it is a byproduct from the papermaking process. This composition has a high glass transition temperature and extended pot-life. This composition also allows for tannic acid's use as functional system to prepare formulations with other properties such as fire retardancy. Advantages:-Environmentally friendly-Inexpensive-High glass transition temperaturePotential Applications:-High performance epoxy-Flame retardant"
Overexpression of Histone Increases Plant Transformation by Agrobacterium,"Agrobacterium has proven to be a useful tool in the transformation of some, but not all, plants.  One problem among recalcitrant plants is the failure of the T-DNA to become integrated into the host genome.  As a result, transformation occurs, but it is transient.     Purdue University researchers have found that a particular histone H2A variant of Arabidopsis is involved in Agrobacterium T-DNA integration into the Arabidopsis genome.  A plant carrying a mutation of this gene cannot integrate T-DNA; however, the wild-type allele can complement this mutation.  In addition, overexpression of the histone H2A gene in wild-type Arabidopsis increases the efficiency of Agrobacterium mediated transformation.  Because the histone H2A gene can reside on the incoming T-DNA and be expressed in the recipient cell, researchers speculate that this effect will improve transformation rates in recalcitrant plants.    Advantages:-Stable Agrobacterium transformation of recalcitrant plants-Unique solution to plant transformation problemsPotential Applications:-Agriculture R&D"
A Digital Micrograph Script for Detection of Astigmatism in Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Images,"Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is a technique used for capturing high resolution images of a wide range of materials including macromolecular complexes at near-atomic resolutions. Minimization of astigmatism of the objective lens is a critical task essential for high resolution TEM imaging. However, the most widely used method currently involves visually examining the roundness of a diffractogram (Thon rings) and simultaneously adjusting objective lens stigmators to make the Thon rings as circular as possible. The drawbacks to this method include limited sensitivity for small astigmatism and potential bias caused by the astigmatism of human eyes. Users can spend upwards to 30 minutes making adjustments.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a system and method that allows for fast and sensitive detection of astigmatism in TEM images. A digital micrograph script allows for such improvements in the readings of astigmatism and allows for real-time feedback to help guide the adjustment of objective lens stigmators and correct the astigmatism of the objective lens. In addition, the script automatically reports the critical imaging parameters by analyzing the Thon Rings. All of this can help improve the accuracy and resolution of TEM imaging.Advantages:-Fast, sensitive detection of astigmatism in TEM images-Real-time feedback adjustment of objective lens-Users rely on script versus visual examination-Less bias than visual examination-Works with existing systems-Automatic report of the critical imaging parametersPotential Applications:-Analysis method in physical, chemical, and biological sciences-Cancer research-Virology-Materials science"
Gene Targeting Using VirE2 Mutant Agrobacterium Strains,"Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation is the core technology for introducing genes into plants. Usually, transferred DNA (T-DNA) is integrated into the plant genome in order to stably transform plants. Scientists now wish to use Agrobacterium to deliver DNA that will target plant genes for specific use as gene transfer technology has become more sophisticated. However, this has previously not been possible at a usable frequency. Scientists have also tried to target specific genes; however, off-targeting, which is targeting of related but not identical genes, is a major problem.  These methods are cumbersome and require building complex proteins for targeting.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a unique technology of gene targeting by introducing T-DNA into the plant in the absence of VirE2 protein. It will provide a method of efficient gene targeting without building cumbersome protein scaffold systems. It will also likely have fewer off-target effects.Advantages:-Efficient gene targeting -Fewer off-targetsPotential applications:-Biological identification-Genetic markers-Gene replacement-Genome editing"
Direct Contact Blood Brain Barrier Triculture,"Neurological disorders have been steadily increasing over the last several decades. While drug discovery and development efforts to mitigate these diseases have concurrently increased to meet the change in prevalence, clinical translation into marketed products have been hindered. One of the main difficulties in creating this translation is the lack of a model that can predict the ability of new chemical entities to permeate through the brain blood barrier (BBB). Current models suffer from leakiness of the in vitro cellular tight junctions and that leakiness leads researchers to overestimate the amount of drug permeation.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a model that represents a more restrictive, accurate model of the BBB. This model is a direct contact, triculture model containing astrocytes, pericytes, and the brain microvessel endothelial cells (BMEC) configured in a physiologically similar manner to an in vivo BBB. This method allows for direct contact between the pericytes and the astrocytes and measures the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) as an indirect measure of cell tightness.  Researchers monitor the TEER until they determine a window in which a triculture would be of utility for permeability studies. This model will offer superior selectivity for screening neuroactive or neurotoxicant agents in vitro and help in the rational selection of candidates for advancement into further clinical studies based on its physiological similarity to the in vivo BBB cellular configuration. This model may also be adopted to select compounds that have a lower potential of eliciting a neurotoxicant effect.Advantages:-More accurate model representing the BBB-Allows materials to permeate through it-Allows for direct contact between the astrocytes and pericytesPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceuticals-Research & Development-Drug discovery"
Facile Expression and Purification of USP17 for use in Cancer Drug Discovery,"USP17, a ubiquitin specific enzyme, is responsible for the progression of the cell cycle to promote cellular proliferation. In many cancers, including breast and prostate, USP17 levels are upregulated, promoting unregulated proliferation and cancer. Over the last 10 years, cell-based studies have identified USP17 as a potential target for cancer therapy; however, there has been no advancement in the production of recombinant USP17. Availability of large amounts of purified, recombinant USP17 is critical for developing an anticancer therapeutic against this target.Researchers from Purdue University have developed a methodology for the expression and purification of recombinant USP17, which allows for the utilization of a much wider array of techniques compared to cell based assays. Recombinant USP17 can be used for kinetic, structural, biochemical studies, and other studies of the enzyme and its response to drug candidates. The Purdue researchers' protocol and the resulting recombinant protein provide others with the tools to develop therapeutics against cancers in which USP17 regulation is a major component. This method will help advance the development of anticancer therapeutics that target USP17.Advantages:-Recombinant protein now available-Facilitates drug discoveryPotential Applications:-Drug Discovery-Pharmaceutical industry-Biomedical industry-Biomedical and Pharmaceutical R&D-Medical diagnosis"
Ubiquitination by a Single Enzyme,"Ubiquitin is a protein that is found in almost all cellular tissues in humans and eukaryotic organisms that helps to regulate the processes of other proteins in the body. Signaling by ubiquitination, the process of adding ubiquitin to a substrate protein, helps to regulate virtually all cellular processes in eukaryotes. For example, ubiquitination can signal the cell to degrade proteins, alter a protein's cellular location, or to promote or prevent protein interactions. Due to its importance, ubiquitination is a primary target of various infectious agents.Researchers at Purdue University have demonstrated that L. pneumophila can override ubiquitination signaling in host cells with its own enzymes, including members of the SidE effector family. While ubiquitination is generally catalyzed by a cascade requiring the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, members of the SidE family of bacterial enzymes are capable of performing ubiquitination independent of this cascade. Following this discovery of ubiquitination catalyzed by a single enzyme, this enzyme, SidE, and various SidE constructs hold promise as new tools for research and development in biotechnology.Advantages:-Performs ubiquitination with a single enzymePotential Applications:-Protein research-Bacterial and viral research-Biotechnology"
Carrier-Free Nanoparticle Formulation with Good Circulation Stability,"Nearly 40 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients under development are poorly soluble in aqueous media leading to low bioavailability and erratic absorption. In an attempt to solve this issue, researchers began to develop nanocrystals of these insoluble drugs. Nanocrystals have increased dissolution rates, offering increased solubility. However, fast-dissolving small nanocrystals provide little advantage to solution formulations, and larger nanocrystals are recognized by the immune system.  In addition, current nanoparticle formulations can contain greater than 50 percent excipients; the excipients often present their own adverse effects, which limit the dose.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method to produce pharmaceutical nanocrystals comprised of more than 85 percent of their respective active ingredients. These nanocrystals are coated with albumin to prevent the immune response and allow the nanocrystals to target cancerous cells unhindered. These nanocrystals have the potential to increase the effectiveness of a wide range of drugs as they contain a much greater percentage of active ingredients, allow for increased bioavailability, and avoid immune recognition.Advantages:-Increases bioavailability of insoluble drugs-Fewer adverse effects-Avoids immune recognitionPotential Applications:-Drug formulationRelated Publications:J. Park, et al., Albumin-coated nanocrystals for carrier-free delivery of paclitaxel. Journal of Controlled Release (2016). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.12.040"
Enhanced Insect Susceptibility to Entomopathogens,"A termite population does not only pose a risk because of the significant structural damage they are capable of inflicting on buildings, crops, and forests, but their subterranean, eusocial lifestyle creates a breeding grounds for disease and microbial growth.  Despite decades of research, no commercially viable biocontrol agent targeted at termites has been developed.  Recent research has suggested termites possess superior defense mechanisms that provide them with virtual immunity against fungal and bacterial pathogens.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology that can identify genes and proteins in termites that increase susceptibility to pathogens.  Whereas much research and development have gone into non-specific chemical insecticides that attempt to brute force their way through the termites' defenses, this new technology aims to dismantle the defense outright.  Using treatments of an immune-suppressive nicotinoid insecticide and fungi and bacterial pathogens, hundreds of genes that encode potential defense mechanisms have been identified; the expression of these genes can be suppressed, increasing the termites' susceptibility to pathogens.  Several protist symbiont enzymes were also identified which may have played a central role in protecting termites from fungal entomopathogens, and a recombinant form of these enzymes may have uses as novel drugs to fight fungal infections.Advantages:-More biorational and environmentally friendly than chemical insecticides-Protein-based enzymatic treatment offers a more ""organic"" approach than conventional drugsPotential Applications:-Termite control-Fungal infection treatmentRelated Publication:Molecular Signatures of Nicotinoid-Pathogen Synergy in the Termite Gut.

Automating Mouse Behavioral Measures,"Mouse experiments are integral to drug discovery and development, but mouse experiments are hampered by three key factors: 1.	Human handling of mice generates stress and fear responses, which can cloud results 2.	Mice are generally nocturnal, but most data is collected during the day by humans, which can taint the data collected 3.	Continuous data collection requires animals to be singly housed, which is expensive and increases animal stress Researchers at Purdue University have developed a general platform that automates data collection, treatments, and the movement of mice between cages without human interference. It integrates data collection with the home cage, allowing for continuous data collection and individual-level data from group-housed animals.Advantages:-Improves quality of animal data by minimizing human interference-Allows for automatic data collection-Integrates data collection with home cage environment-Gathers individual data from group-housed animalsPotential Applications:-Drug discovery and development-Research"
P188 as a Treatment for Trauma to the Nervous System,"Following mechanical injury to the spinal cord, a large number of sensory and motor nerve fibers are disrupted and subsequently destroyed. The major pathology involved in such nerve loss is related to the breakdown of membranes of nerve cell axons, even to the point of complete severance. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and other copolymers seal nerve membrane defects and breaches caused by direct mechanical damage. Purdue University researchers have developed a technology that uses poloxamer P188 in spinal cord injury repair applications. P188 can be applied topically to exposed nerve fibers or by intravenous or subcutaneous injection. Similar research has been done with a related polymer, PEG; however, there are several advantages with using P188 in spinal cord injury applications. Advantages: -Can be produced in sterile form-Can be administered by intravenous or subcutaneous injection-Gives identical functional recovery to topically applied PEGPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Spinal cord injuries"
Microorganisms as Radiation Sensors,"Measuring radiation has been an ever-improving science since radiation became an important topic decades ago. While devices can measure radiation in quantitative fashion, measuring radiation dosages in organisms has been a harder case to solve. Current radiation sensing technologies cannot provide biologically relevant information regarding radiation exposure, which prohibits us from learning the level of radiation damage. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method of measuring radiation that correlates with the actual damage caused by radiation to DNA in organisms. By measuring the reaction outputs of microorganisms supplied by sugar, information can be gathered regarding the extent that radiation damaged the DNA of the cells. This method of measuring radiation in organisms can replace outdated film badges and similar sensors while providing better, more biologically relevant information.Advantages:-Simple design and easy to measure-Provides information useful for biological purposes-Correlates with DNA damagePotential Applications:-Radiation exposure treatment-Laboratory experiments"
PatchSurfer:  Software for Exploring Protein-Ligand Interactions,"Interactions with small ligand molecules are essential aspects of proteins and there is an urgent need for computational methods for function prediction. A major drawback of current approaches is the dependency on the chemical features present in the known actives.Researchers at Purdue University have addressed this major drawback by developing an alignment free, surface-based, pocket comparison program called PatchSurfer. PatchSurfer represents a binding pocket as a combination of segmented surface patches, with each patch characterized by its geometrical shape, the electrostatic potential, the hydrophobicity, and the concaveness. The device searches a database of known pockets and finds similar ones based on the surface patch similarity. Because each surface patch characterizes geometrical and physicochemical properties of a protein pocket and ligand on a continuous surface, the surface representation is less sensitive to subtle changes on the pocket and ligand conformation. This aspect helps to quickly allow a better understanding of protein-ligand interactions, and ultimately, can help to enhance the design of new ligands for a wide array of drug targets. Advantages:-Less sensitive to subtle changes on the pocket/ligand conformation-Faster search speed-New ligands for a wide array of drug targets Potential Applications:-Ligand design-Virtual screening-Pharmaceuticals-Drug targets"
Trapping Particles at Enhanced Speed and Efficiency,"The trapping and aggregating of submicron and nanoscale analytes is especially important in applications such as biosensing and surface enhanced spectroscopies. The technique known as optical tweezers, which traps particles using a strong optical gradient force induced by a focused laser beam, has been one of the most highly used techniques for the past several decades. The use of plasmonic trapping or plasmonic nanotweezers is also becoming popular in order to overcome some of the deficiencies of optical tweezers. Although this new method improves the confinement of submicron and nanoscale particles, it also suffers from an inherently slow process due to the fact that particles are transported via Brownian motion. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technique for trapping particles, which has greatly enhanced trapping speed and efficiency. This method replaces thin film substrates with plasmonic resonant nanostructures and actually utilizes the collective heat generation capabilities of these nanostructures, which has been considered an undesirable byproduct in the past. By coupling the induced heating of the nanostructures with a low frequency AC electric field, strong microfluidic vortices are created that can rapidly transport suspended particles towards plasmonic nanoantennas where they are captured. This technology describes a way to achieve rapid particle transport, high throughput concentration, dynamic manipulation, and sorting of particles based on size while using less laser power and focusing. Advantages: -Greatly increases trapping speed -Requires less laser power and focusing -Sorts particles based on size Potential Applications: -Biosensing and lab-on-a-chip systems"
Cleansing of Surfactant-Coated Nanoparticles,"Cationic surfactants, such as cetrimonium bromide (CTAB), are important for the scalable synthesis of metal nanoparticles, but also cause problems in dispersion stability and toxicity in subsequent applications. The leaching of toxic CTAB into a medium can occur over several months. The removal and replacement of CTAB is difficult to do without compromising the quality of the nanoparticle dispersions. Practitioners in the field typically functionalize CTAB-coated nanoparticles by simple physisorption or chemisorption, followed by centrifugation or dialysis. However, these methods do not guarantee complete CTAB removal. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method to completely remove cationic surfactants, like CTAB, without causing any adverse effect on the nanoparticles. This method involves two main steps. First, the nanoparticles are purified through several cycles of filtration and redispersion in cleansing solutions, and then, the CTAB is replaced with citrate through the same process using a sodium citrate solution. The citrate now acts as the stabilizing agent for the nanoparticles in subsequent manipulations and functionalization. The process is scalable and effective for future nanoparticle manufacturing needs such as metal nanoparticles for nanomedicine applications. Advantages: -Completely removes cationic surfactants without damage to nanoparticles -Scalable for various manufacturing needs Potential Applications: -Cationic surfactant removal-Nanoparticle manufacturing-Nanomedicine"
kHz Frame Rate Confocal Imaging,"Confocal microscopy give researchers the ability to produce high-resolution, three-dimensional images of subjects as diverse as crystals, cells, and even the fluorescence of single molecules. Although confocal microscopes are a common tool used to generate static images, current instruments cannot capture fast processes such as chemical reactions. Further, confocal microscopy is difficult to use outside of the lab because the instrument must be isolated from vibrations while a sample is scanned. Purdue University researchers have designed a confocal microscope capable of capturing quantitative images with a frame rate on the scale of kHz, which is faster than the 30 Hz for current microscopy techniques. As opposed to the rectangular scan pattern used in other microscopes, the Purdue researchers' instrument captures pixels along a Lissajous curve whose geometry can be tuned by the user. This scan pattern requires much less time to capture an image. By coupling this scan pattern with image processing software, the potential for this approach is unlocked. For any given frame of a movie, the dark spots within the scan pattern can be statistically interpolated from the scanned pixels and the movement of the image over time. If a high-resolution still image is preferred, then individual frames are combined, like those in a panoramic photograph, to assemble the high-resolution image. In this way, both low-resolution movies and high-resolution stills can be captured from the same data set. This combination of Lissajous scan-pattern and software processing shows promise for faster detection of microscopic processes and is flexible enough to be extended for long-distance applications like lidar. Advantages: -Much faster frame rate than current confocal microscopes -Raw data can be used to generate high-resolution still image -Generation of a high-frame rate, lower-resolution moviePotential Applications:-Microscopy applications where movement distortion is a problem-Microscope use in exotic environments-Lidar telescopes-Scanned laser imaging"
Reagent for Measurement of Protein Phosphorylation by Gel Electrophoresis,"Research and Development labs (R&D) in academia, pharmaceutical, and biotech companies often assess the phosphorylation of a protein or classes of proteins. Currently, large-scale phosphorylation analysis is used to understand how signaling pathways work and how they may be deregulated in disease states. Even though thousands of protein phosphorylation sites can be identified, researchers may only be interested in a small sample of proteins for a signaling pathway. Hence, these large scale analysis techniques are time-consuming and cost-prohibitive. The applicability of gel-based proteomic strategy in phosphoproteomics has been largely limited by the lack of technologies for specific and quantitative detection of phosphoproteins in gels. To resolve these issues, researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel gel-based process, called Differential Gel Electrophoresis of Phosphoproteome (DiGEP). This process uses metal ions, such as Ti4+, Zr4+, Fe3+, and Ga3+, which are attracted to phosphate groups and attach fluorophores on the phosphoproteins. This ultimately helps visualize phosphorylation changes in different samples on the same gel. DiGEP analyses are advantageous because they enable the visualization of phosphoproteins on a single gel and select only relevant proteins for in-gel digestion and mass spectrometric analysis. It is highly specific, selective, and quantitative and can be used routinely in labs for quantitative phosphorylation measurement, in vitro kinase assay, kinase and phosphatase activity assay, kinase/phosphatase inhibitor screening, and detection of in vivo phosphorylation. Not only will this technology help a general biological laboratory to effectively measure changes in protein phosphorylation, but will also help pharmaceutical and biotech industries to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic agents relating to kinases. Advantages: -Visualization of phosphoproteins -Selection of proteins for spectrometric analysis -Effective and quantitative measures Potential Applications: -R&D labs-Disease research"
A Novel Method for Early Detection of Salmonella Contamination in Food Samples,"To prevent food-borne pathogens from spreading and helping with safety and health of a population, it is essential to have pathogen detection systems. It is difficult to process food samples and there is a need to use different types of enzymes for this process. Current technologies for detection include culture enrichment and microfiltration, which are not as efficient, and none of these technologies supply enzyme solutions for enriching food extracts with respect to background microorganisms.Purdue University researchers developed a product that won the grand prize in the 2014 FDA Food Safety Challenge - http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/purdue-university-innovation-wins-fda-food-safety-challenge.html. This new product of enzyme formulations and software for defining best conditions, using enzymes to treat food extracts. This product improves recovery of microorganisms and enhances rapid hollow tube microfiltration (in connection with a C3D instrument). It would allow matching enzymes to different food materials, identifying optimum conditions, and obtaining enhanced microbial recovery in order to analyze food microorganisms within four hours. This system would allow rapid concentration, retrieval, and discovery of pathogens that are present in various types of food. Due to the individual components of this technology, it has a 3- to 5-fold faster recovery of microorganisms, while concurrently minimizing the need for enrichment or selective culture that is usually used to obtain adequate cultures for pathogen detection.To view a video related to this technology, click this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdJSDPnmIfs&feature=youtu.be.Advantages: -Enhanced microfiltration-Faster process for analyzing microorganisms-Minimizes need for selective culturesPotential Applications:-Food industry-Food safety"
Improved BioCD Detects Molecular Structures in Samples,"In many chemical, biological, medical, and diagnostic applications, it is desirable to detect the presence of specific molecular structures in a sample.  Many molecular structures, such as cells, viruses, bacteria, toxins, and DNA fragments, are recognized by particular receptors.  One such technology for screening for a plurality of molecular structures is the so-called immunological compact disk, which simply includes an antibody microarray.  Current methodologies have proven useful thus far, but are often characterized by large surface areas per element, long interaction lengths, or complicated resonance structures.  Previously, a BioCD technology was developed to solve these problems, but it suffered from data that was corrupted by background noise.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an improved BioCD technology that allows for very accurate and fast scans of biological binding sites.  This technology makes possible a simple disk fabrication for spinning-disk immunoassays.  It also establishes a common global quadrature for the entire disk, as opposed to each array element establishing its own quadrature condition.  This will greatly facilitate disk fabrication with little or no effect of fabrication on the read fidelity.  The system also has 100 percent light detection efficiency and automatic compensation of laser intensity drift.  It can be implemented with differential encoding that directly subtracts out non-specific binding.Advantages:-Establishes global quadrature-100 percent light detection efficiency-Automatic compensation of laser intensityPotential Applications:-Biological structure detection"
Model for Predicting the Cloud Point of Biodiesels,"The use of biodiesel fuels is limited in cold climates by its tendency to crystallize, which blocks filters, clogs tanks, and generally restricts flow. The crystallization properties of biodiesel are directly related to the chemical composition of the fuel, which is not regulated. Since biodiesel fuels can be made from any fat source, the cloud point (onset of crystallization temperature) varies significantly. The cloud point of biodiesel fuels is a complex, non-linear function of composition of fatty acid methyl ester composition, making it difficult to predict. Currently, models for predicting the cloud point are based on statistical methods, which are based on data and measurements. These models are limited because they can only predict the behavior for those specific compositions. Purdue University researchers have developed a model that can accurately predict the cloud point of the mixture of fatty acid methyl esters according to their chemical composition. Since this model is not based on data or statistical methods, it clearly predicts the non-linear behavior of methyl ester mixtures. Advantages: -Not based on statistical methods, so it accurately predicts the cloud point of fatty acid mixtures -Predicts the cloud point of a mixture of biodiesel and petroleum diesel once chemical composition is knownPotential Applications:-Biofuel Manufacturers"
Simultaneous Identification of Multiple Pathogenic Organisms,"Immunodetection in microbiology, biosafety, and biosurveillance is very important for detecting and identifying potentially harmful pathogens. Currently, there are many methods of immunodetection, including traditional optical labeling, such as fluorescence and phosphorescence, and more recent developments using antibody-immobilized bacteria or bacteria bound to microfluidic chips that have been developed to increase optical signals, but many of these techniques are designed to identify a particular type of bacteria and do not allow for multiplexing or simultaneous detection of multiple bacterial species. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for simultaneous identification of multiple pathogenic organisms using heavy metal antibody tagging and plasma-based detection (MAPD). MAPD uses a traditional immuno-recognition approach, but is able to simultaneously detect and identify the presence of multiple antigens without requiring multiple, time-consuming experiments performed in parallel. This method offers fast and sensitive pathogen detection with minimal sample processing and preparation. The use of heavy metal tags generates a very low signal background, which allows MAPD to be used on a large subset of molecular targets that can be combined in a simple, low cost manner. Advantages: -Highly multiplexed classification of pathogens -Fast, sensitive detection with minimal sample processing and preparation -Low numbers of molecules of the target antibody can be measuredPotential Applications:-Microbiology-Biosafety-Biosurveillance"
Analysis of Microbial Colonies with Plate Sieve,"There is increasing use of technology and computers to document activity and growth of biological processes. The use of location algorithms to verify a bacterial colony on a plate allows a user to monitor colony growth over extended periods from hours to days. This would be fast and efficient in any research setting that utilizes bacterial colony identification systems. In need for such a system, researchers at Purdue University have developed a computer implemented technology that uses time stamps and location algorithms to identify bacterial colonies on a plate and locate the same colonies on subsequent timed data points for a rectangular plate. This software displays colonies and all colony light scatter patterns for that plate on the screen while identifying each colony on an image of the plate that is being viewed. By using a processor, areas in the first and second image would correspond to possible microbial colonies, and hence, a colony map is generated. There are currently no existing technologies that compare to this technology, making this beneficial and novel for research with microbial colonies. Advantages: -Use of time stamps and location algorithms -Efficient identification of colonies -Generation of colony mapsPotential Applications:-Research Labs-Medical/Health-Drug Development"
Super-Stable Encapsulated Gold Nanorods as Cancer Theranostics,"Gold nanorods (GNR) have potential uses as imaging agents or in cancer treatments because of their ability to be tuned to absorb or scatter various types of light. Gold particles could be injected into the body near a tumor and then heated with a light source to selectively kill the cancer cells. Unfortunately, current fabrication techniques create GNRs that are cytotoxic and breakdown quickly in a saline solution. To address this, researchers at Purdue University have developed a self-assembly process that encapsulates GNRs into block copolymer micelles. The resultant GNRs are stable against aggregation, even under physiological salt conditions, for indefinite periods of time. This method can be scaled up for mass production and can easily be extended to encapsulate and stabilize other nanoparticle agents.Advantages:-Stable for indefinite periods of time-Can be scaled for mass production-Encapsulate and stabilize other nanoparticle agentsPotential Applications-Manufacturing-Pharmaceuticals-Medical/HealthcareRelated Publications:Kim, Dae Hwan, et. al. Preparation of Super-Stable Gold Nanorods via Encapsulation into Block Copolymer Micelles. ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces. 2012, 4 (4), pp 1872–1877.DOI: 10.1021/am300198v."
Affinity Stabilization of Protein Drugs,"The development of protein drugs is often hindered by the instability of these large, complex molecules. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel method for stabilizing protein drugs based on ligand binding. The peptide epitopes are covalently linked to a biodegradable synthetic polymer, forming a pseudo-ligand. The pseudo-ligand binds to the protein drug with high affinity and helps to preserve near-native conformation, minimize unfolding, and prevent aggregation during manufacturing, shipping, and storage. Since the pseudo-ligand is comprised of a biodegradable polymer backbone and small peptide epitopes, it is expected to be biocompatible and nonimmunogenic. In some applications, it may be desirable to administer the protein drug in its free form. In such cases, the pseudo-ligand can be immobilized on a solid surface through a coupling agent and released prior to administration using a competing ligand.Advantages:-Preserves near-native conformation-Biocompatible and nonimmunogenicPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industryRelated Publications:Zhang, Jun, et al. Protein G, Protein A and Protein A-Derived Peptides Inhibit the Agitation Induced Aggregation of IgG. Molecular Pharmaceutics. 2012, 9 (3), pp 622–628.DOI: 10.1021/mp200548x."
Chemical Classification with Digital Compressive Detection,"Many applications in biology, medicine, manufacturing, and security require the rapid identification and quantification of chemical species within complex mixtures. Methods, such as hyperspectral imaging and monitoring of dynamic chemical processes paired with multivariate statistical techniques, are often used for chemical classification. One problem for high-speed chemical analysis is the time required to collect and analyze hyperspectral data. Purdue University researchers have developed a new strategy for rapid and accurate chemical classification. This strategy, digital compressive detection, can be used to classify substances with various degrees of spectral overlap. Digital compressive detection can also positively distinguish chemical species by detecting as few as 10 scattered photons, which could require as little as 30 microseconds. While previous strategies focused on minimizing spectral differences, digital compressive detection is optimized to minimize the error in the chemical classification. Advantages: -As few as 10 to 25 photons per measurement required for accurate classification -Optimized to minimize errorPotential Applications:-Biology-Drug development-Manufacturing"
Engineered Ribozyme to Introduce Unnatural Amino Acids into Proteins,"There are many biotechnology applications where it is necessary to introduce an unnatural amino acid at a specific location within a protein. Such modifications can be used to generate protein-protein interaction maps, track single molecules within cells, create reagents for use in biotechnology, or improve the pharmacokinetic properties of macromolecular therapeutics. Current technologies based on protein tRNA synthases are restricted by these enzymes' specificity for their amino acid substrates, limiting the amino acid substrates that can be used. To use these proteins within a cell, bio-orthogonal tRNA-synthase molecules that bind, recognize, and charge a foreign tRNA must be identified for each organism. RNA enzymes, ribozymes, capable of charging tRNAs with an activated amino acid have been identified; however, they are not capable of selecting and charging a single type of tRNA within a cell. To find a more efficient recognition system, researchers at Purdue University have engineered a ribozyme that can be readily programmed to recognize a specific tRNA and charge it with an unnatural amino acid. This ribozyme can be easily delivered to a cell via plasmid, along with its tRNA substrates. The ribozyme also accepts a wide variety of amino acid substrates.  Using a ribozyme catalyst instead of a protein catalyst, bypasses the need to translate an introduced gene within a cell. This technology has potential use in protein engineering as the charged tRNA products can be used to site-specifically introduce an unnatural amino acid into a protein sequence.Advantages:-Specifically charges tRNA with a wide variety of amino acids-Programmable tRNA selectivity-Easily delivered to cells-Bypasses translationPotential Applications:-Protein Engineering"
Electrostatic Control of DNA Melting Temperature,"Much of modern molecular biology is founded on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. PCR-based methods are used in DNA fingerprinting, cloning, phylogenetics, mutagenesis, analysis of gene expression, and numerous other biological studies. In traditional PCR, double stranded DNA is melted at high temperature, annealed at a lower temperature with short complimentary ""primer"" DNA, and copied by a polymerase enzyme starting at the primer. The cycle is repeated to generate a suitable amount of DNA for further use. PCR is still typically carried out by thermal cycling and still carried out in sealed tubes or sometimes within oil droplets to combat evaporation.Purdue University researchers have developed a technology that will allow PCR to be accomplished in sub-nanoliter-volume, oil-free droplets at a lower temperature. Positively-charged magnesium ions are typically included in a PCR reaction to stabilize the negatively-charged DNA. As opposed to melting DNA with heat, the Purdue researchers' technology applies an electrical bias to the droplet. The magnesium ions migrate towards the electrodes, and DNA is destabilized because the effective magnesium concentration is reduced. This technology can facilitate a lower-temperature, ion-controlled PCR reaction. Furthermore, the technology should also prove useful in related applications that rely on ion concentrations.Advantages: -Strengthens the interaction between analyte molecules and receptors-Does not require high temperature to melt DNA-Improves upon several biochemical sensing technologiesPotential Applications:-Early disease detection-Isoelectric protein separation-DNA related applications"
Targeted Therapeutic Against Bladder Cancer,"Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer among men and eleventh among women. Bladder cancer has a high rate of recurrence post-surgery. Despite its obvious high impact on public health, the available therapies are still of limited efficacy. Instillation of therapeutics in the lumen of the bladder assures access to the tumor without affecting normal cells, but dilution of the therapeutic agent by urine flow and its elimination by periodic emptying of the bladder, greatly reduces the treatment efficacy. The market for new technologies related to novel therapeutics to support the treatment of such cancers includes pharmaceutical companies and cancer research centers. Purdue University researchers have developed a novel strategy using an epidermal growth factor (EGF) targeted toxin, which can be used for elimination of both superficial and invasive bladder tumors. This is a highly efficient, targeted strategy that reduces treatment time from hours (current therapies) to minutes. Further, this agent can be administered by a pharmaceutically acceptable delivery system in the lumen of the bladder for treatment. In addition to being easily used against bladder cancer, this strategy is also applicable to other EGF receptor-dependent cancers such as lung and skin cancer. Advantages: -High efficacy and fast action -Targets superficial and invasive bladder tumors -EGF targeting and internalization of the toxinPotential Applications:-Bladder cancer treatment-Lung and Skin cancer treatmentInternational Journal of Cancer Research Article - https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijc.32719A Novel, Safe, Fast, Efficient Treatment for Her2-positive and Negative Bladder Cancer Utilizing an EGF-Anthrax Toxin Chimera.  October 4, 2019."
Targeted Therapeutic for Bladder Cancer,"Bladder carcinomas are among the more frequent and highly recurrent cancers. In spite of its high impact on public health and its increasing burden to the health budget, available therapies are still of limited efficacy. Bladder instillation of nontargeted therapeutics is rendered inefficient by dilution of the agent by urine influx and elimination of the agent by the periodic voiding of the bladder content.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a family of artificial multivalent targeting peptides that show improved protein solubility/stability, greater binding potential, and a very high rate of uptake by tumor cells. This design is based on the strategies utilized by different bacteria, such as the therapeutically used Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), to bind and to be internalized by tumor cells without causing patient hypersensitivity, morbidity, and risk of infection.  Further, this technology has the potential for use as a targeting agent for the delivery of therapeutics to treat bladder cancer by having this technology formulated into pharmaceutically suitable carriers and administered into the lumen of the bladder. This revolutionizes bladder cancer treatment and can lead to therapeutic innovations in the treatment of other cancers such as skin and lung cancer.Advantages:-Greater protein stability, solubility, and tumor cell binding properties-Fast and efficient uptake by tumor cells-No infection risk or hypersensitivity developedPotential Applications:-Bladder cancer treatment-Potential skin and lung cancer treatmentRelated Publications:Coon, B.

Perforated MOS Structure for Single Biomolecule Detection,"Characterizing and sequencing single biomolecules, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, carbohydrates, etc., offers significant impact to science, medicine, and biotechnology. Single biomolecule detection has many benefits and could allow for early disease detection and screening, have pharmacological relevance, and help in understanding genetic information encoded in DNA. There are many proposed methods of studying single biomolecules, but they have several limitations. Many techniques require the isolation of the molecule prior to study, and most techniques are also limited by sample preparation, sensitivity, and specificity to specific categories of biomolecules. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for single biomolecule detection that allows for characterization and sequencing of biomolecules without the limitations of current nanochannel technologies. This method uses a metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensor with embedded, fluidic nanochannels. As a biomolecule moves through the nanochannel, a high frequency current is generated that contains information about the biomolecule, such as the type of nucleotides in the case of DNA/RNA, which can be used to sequence the molecule. This method does not have the problems associated with other nanopore techniques because it does not require the difficult drilling of extremely small nanopores, can detect four nucleotides at a time, and is not significantly affected by the rotation or position of the biomolecule in the nanochannel. Advantages: -Detection of single molecule or low concentration biomolecules, bio-polymers, RNAs, DNAs, carbohydrates, proteins, viruses, and virions -Lowers the cost of sequencing single molecule DNAs, RNAs, and carbohydrates -Addresses shortcomings of current nanochannel technologyPotential Applications:-Development of tools for early detection of a number of diseases and environmental hazards-Biomedical applications in diagnosis and therapy-Early detection of viruses-Study of carbohydrates-Genetics"
Tumor Detection/Treatment Model ,"Time and money are often wasted when using currently available cell culture models for initial phases of the development of drugs and detection tools. Currently, the best available cell culture models are hanging drops with tumor nodules or 3D monoculture of tumor nodules; however, the tumors in these models are not true representations of the disease due to a poorly replicated environment.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a disease-on-a-chip model to provide a better solution for this problem. This model reproduces the luminal portion of ductal systems. Tumors are grown in an environment that replicates the in vivo setting observed in human patients, providing a more accurate assessment of the of the tumor's sensitivity to drugs.  This model permits test drug targeting to the correct cells and side effects on the normal adjacent tissue at the same time.  In addition, this design can be used for automated tissue culture.   Advantages: -Tumors are grown in an in vivo-like environment-Could be sealed for high throughput-Provides a more accurate assessment of a tumor's sensitivity to various compounds-Performs two tests at once, i.e., drug targeting and side effectsPotential Applications:-Automated tissue culture-Drug targeting"
Novel Anticancer Compounds,"Natural product antitumor compounds, such as FR901464 and spliceostatin A, have particular interest in clinical applications due to their remarkable antitumor activity and effectiveness against human solid tumors. More significantly, both FR901464 and spliceostatin A potently inhibit in vitro splicing and promote pre-mRNA accumulation. The first total synthesis of FR901464 was accomplished in 29-41, which made the original methods time consuming and costly. In addition, it was difficult to produce a pure form of the compound. Researchers at Purdue University have developed concise, enantioselective syntheses of pure FR901464 and spliceostatin A, which can be accomplished in only 10 and 9 linear steps, respectively. By drastically decreasing the number of steps, this method is cost efficient, convergent, and amenable to the synthesis of structural variants. The researchers have already developed nine synthetic analogues, which are potentially more potent and bioactive, as well as synthesized several other high-quality, natural products such as jasplakinolide and lasonolide A. Advantages: -Efficient and cost effective -Amenable to the synthesis of structural variantsPotential Applications:-Pharmaceuticals-Drug development-Cancer treatment"
Miniature Ambient Ionization Mass Spectrometry System for Analysis of Microorganisms,"Electrospray ionization is regarded as the best-characterized and most efficient method for ionization of molecules in solution phase. There are three main stages in the process:  droplet formation, droplet evaporation, and ion formation. When a strong electric field is applied, a cone forms and a mist of small droplets is emitted from the tip. This method can produce small charged droplets under a low flow rate; however, the small size of the tip and the materials used causes problems with the source, the tip may become damaged or clogged easily. Other methods for overcoming clogging have been developed, but these methods still only work for pure chemicals dissolved in a solution. Purdue University researchers have developed a novel method to analyze a sample containing one or more microorganisms. The method involves applying the sample to a porous material, adding a solvent, injecting a high voltage to generate ions, and then expelling the ions from the porous material in order to analyze them with a mass or mini mass spectrometer. With this method, the sample does not need culturing or prepping prior to analysis; it can be done with a solid, liquid, or gas. This technology provides a way to identify the microorganism down to its subspecies, substrain, and/or isolate level. Advantages: -Biological samples can be stored in precut filter papers for months -Filter paper minimizes matrix effects and enhances the MS signal of chemicals in complex samples -Paper can be pretreated to contain internal standards that are released at certain points in quantitative analysisPotential Applications:-Chemical Analysis-Biotechnology"
"High-Speed Multispectral Discrimination Technology, Flow Cytometry","Current fluorescence intensity-based techniques are well-established in traditional screening methods that are used in diagnostic instruments. These methods rely on organic fluorochromes and emission band-detection systems. Although very powerful, they are restricted to approximately one dozen simultaneous fluorescent probes due to their design. Complex spectral compensation, complicated and numerous optics, and restricted spectral bandwidths make the current technology less efficient than desired. Purdue University researchers have developed a new technology that allows high speed analysis of single particles for classification. Characteristics of this technology include advanced spectral analysis, high speed detection, and single particle discrimination capabilities. The basic principles of flow cytometry, image collection systems, image analysis, and signal processing are utilized. This technology's advanced detectors, signal separation processes, and analytical processes combine to provide new opportunities for cellular classification systems, such as clinical pathology, analytical cytology, or advanced pharmaceuticals in cellular systems. Advantages: -High-speed detection of multiple labeling molecules and single particle discrimination capabilities -Reduces size and cost of systems -Allows greater versatility in fluorescent combinationsPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Diagnostics"
Topoisomerase I Inhibitors Substituted with Carbohydrates,"Topoisomerase I is an ideal protein to target to reduce cancer activity given it is expressed more often in cancer cells than most terminally differentiated cells. The enzyme is responsible for structural changes in the DNA protein complex, allowing enzymes easy access for DNA synthesis. Topoisomerases have an important role in regulation of the cell cycle, and when the enzyme is inhibited from completing its task, the cell will activate death pathways. Many anticancer drugs have been designed to target this protein as it is expressed in all proliferating cells, which is a common feature of transformed cells. The problem with the synthesized drugs is they are not easily metabolized by the body and their insolubility makes them difficult to develop in the laboratory, limiting bioavailability. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new topoisomerase I inhibitor that incorporates carbohydrate groups to increase solubility. The result is drug that is more bioavailable and stable, which comes with the added benefit of smaller doses acting more effectively. The synthetic route developed for these compounds is simple, versatile, and easily scalable. The newly synthesized compounds displayed potent anti-Top1 activity and ceased proliferation in transformed cells. Advantages: -Carbohydrate-substituted indenoisoquinolines overcome common problems of solubility with this drug class -Topoisomerase I is a proven target for cancer therapyPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthercare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-Cancer Treatment"
7-Azaindenoisoquinolines as Anticancer Agents,"Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) is an important protein found in the cell; it is used to unwind and reduce torsional stress on DNA during replication. TOP1 inhibitors are a useful chemotherapy agent because cells that are constantly dividing, such as cancer cells, are much more susceptible to attack; cell death will occur when topoisomerase 1 is inhibited. TOP1 inhibitors make up a large portion of the chemotherapy market because they can be used to target a wide variety of proliferating tumors. The characteristic of uninhibited division is a common feature in cancer that can be targeted without needing a specific marker for each cancer cell type. As more information becomes readily available, it is becoming apparent that within tumors there is a heterogeneous population of cells populating the primary tumor and the secondary tumors.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a series of 7-azaindenoisoquinoline derivatives that act to inhibit topoisomerase and subsequently induce cell death. This new class of topoisomerase inhibitors has the potential to possess enhanced chemical stability over traditional inhibitors, while increasing inhibitor effectiveness. Advantages: -Azaindenoisoquinolines have enhanced chemical stability and effectiveness over other TOP1 inhibitors -TOP1 is a proven target for cancer therapyPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Cancer Treatment"
Structure-Activity Relationships of Azaindenoisoquinolines,"Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) is an important protein found in the cell; it is used to unwind and reduce torsional stress on DNA during replication. TOP1 inhibitors are a useful chemotherapy agent because cells that are constantly dividing, such as cancer cells, are much more susceptible to attack; cell death will occur when topoisomerase 1 is inhibited. TOP1 inhibitors make up a large portion of the chemotherapy market because they can be used to target a wide variety of proliferating tumors. The characteristic of uninhibited division is a common feature in cancer that can be targeted without needing a specific marker for each cancer cell type. As more information becomes readily available, it is becoming apparent that within tumors there is a heterogeneous population of cells populating the primary tumor and the secondary tumors. Purdue University researchers have developed a novel process for synthesizing four TOP1 inhibitors and have optimized their structures for the greatest inhibitory activity and cytoxicity towards dividing cells. The compounds consist of 7-, 8-, 9-, and 10-azaindenoisoquinoline structures. Advantages: -TOP1 is a proven target for cancer therapy -Azaindenoisoquinolines have enhanced chemical stability and effectiveness over other TOP1 inhibitors"
Tracking Cellular Internalization and Trafficking of Nanomaterials,"Understanding how drugs and viruses enter cells is paramount for better drug efficacy and for designing more targeted drugs to combat infection. Currently, traditional molecular biology techniques are used to understand the passage of a molecule from the outside of the cell to the cytoplasm. While these techniques offer a great starting point to understanding key proteins involved in transport, they only provide a snapshot of a specific interaction and miss other biomolecules that are involved in intermediate steps. Purdue University researchers have developed a multifunctional reagent to study cellular transport of molecules. The novel reagent will interact with multiple proteins necessary for transport into the cell and the resulting conjugates identified by mass spectrometry. At varying times, cellular proteins can be isolated to identify the proteins the reagent is bound to, giving investigators a better understanding of what is involved in cellular transport. Advantages:-Information to design more efficacious drugs-Learn more detailed information about cellular transport-Design more targeted drugs to treat infectionPotential Applications:-Bioinformatics-Pharmaceuticals-Chemical analysis-Drug developmentRelated Publications:Wang, Linna, et al. Time-Resolved Proteomic Visualization of Dendrimer Cellular Entry and Trafficking. Journal of the American Chemical Society. 2015, 137 (40), pp 12772–12775.DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5b07875."
HPTP Phosphatase in Cancer,"The function of protein tyrosine phosphatases and their role in cancer have been recognized for several years. In general, these phosphatases negatively regulate the oncogenic function of certain kinases by reversing pro-malignant modification of critical signaling proteins, including the kinases themselves. Notably, many solid tumors are associated with unphosphorylated EphA2. EphA2 is a tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed and functionally altered in malignant cells. The lack of cytoplasmic phosphorylation causes EphA2 to promote malignant cell growth, invasion, and survival. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment using a human protein tyrosine phosphatase (HPTP). HPTP is overexpressed in these aggressive cancer cells and has been shown to target EphA2 and other Eph receptors. In cell-based studies, HPTP overexpression has been demonstrated to be sufficient to cause malignant transformation. Thus, inhibitors of HPTP hold potential for targeting the large number of cancers that are associated with unphosphorylated Eph receptors. Advantages: -Identifies an important oncoprotein, HPTP -Suggests novel therapeutic approaches for certain cancers involving HPTP targeting and inactivation, which would reduce HPTP activity in cancerous cellsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Cancer Detection-Cancer Treatment"
Synthesis of Novel Anticancer Agent Peloruside A,"Peloruside A (1), a 16-membered macrolide antitumor agent, was first isolated by L. West and P. Northcote from the New Zealand marine sponge, Mycale hentscheli.  It has shown potent antitumor activity against resistant cell lines, such as P388 murine leukemia cells with an IC50 value of 10 ng/mL. Peloruside A is a microtubule stabilizing agent operating with a similar mechanism to the most widely used anticancer agent, taxol, and has shown a synergistic effect with taxol itself. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a process for synthetic production of Peloruside A, which is amenable to the development of analogs and derivatives of this important molecule. This synthetic strategy opens the possibility of creating unnatural analogs of Peloruside A with improved potency, bioavailability, and other pharmacokinetic properties. These developments will facilitate drug discovery for cancer treatment. Advantages: -Novel synthetic pathway to highly potent cancer drug -Synthetic process amenable to drug discovery of improved therapeuticsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-Cancer Treatment"
Affinity Capture Materials for Protein Structural Analysis,"Currently, it is difficult to isolate a protein sample that is pure and maintains its native conformations for structural analysis. Knowing the shape of a protein helps to understand the function and how it interacts with other proteins and nucleotides. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a material to capture proteins from crude samples that has high affinity for the specified protein and low non-specific binding giving a very low background. This device can be developed into a commercially available grid that can be used in electron microscopy experiments that avoids non-specific binding and gives scientists straightforward analysis of protein structures. Obvious applications include high-dilution sampling, viral concentrations in hospitals, protein function experiments in laboratories, and protein sampling from crude sources.Advantages:-High affinity for specific protein-Low background interference from non-specific proteins-Protein maintains native conformationPotential Applications:-Biotechnology"
Implantable Wireless Glucose Sensor,"Type 1 diabetes afflicts approximately one million people living in the United States and 10 to 20 million people worldwide. Caused by the body's inability to produce its own insulin to regulate blood glucose levels, type 1 diabetes can cause a wide variety of complications and requires careful monitoring of glucose levels and insulin injections. The most common way to monitor blood glucose levels is with a finger stick, which measures glucose at a point in time, potentially missing important fluctuations, such as sudden hypoglycemic episodes. The most effective way to measure glucose levels is to monitor it continuously in a way that it could be recorded and tracked. To accomplish this, various monitor designs have been proposed, including several designs for implantable sensors, but most require an internal power supply or make use of potentially dangerous enzymes. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new design for an implantable glucose monitor that requires no internal power and has a fast reaction time to changes in glucose levels. This device uses a glucose sensitive ferrogel, which grows and shrinks based on the level of glucose present. This device is expected to have an area no larger than one cubic centimeter and once implanted into the body's soft-tissue, the ferrogel's change in size can be detected wirelessly, providing a continuous measurement of glucose levels.Advantages:-Device requires no internal power supply-Fast reaction time to changes in glucose levels-Provides continuous measurement of glucose levelsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceutical industry"
Detection of Contaminants in Water,"Ammonia at elevated concentrations is poisonous to different organisms. For examples, 22.8 ppm can be lethal to water organisms and exposure to ammonia as low as 35 ppm for over 15 minutes can be dangerous to humans. Therefore, a continuous, online ammonia monitoring system is highly desired, especially for dynamic aqueous water delivery systems. Various electrochemical, catalytic, and optical fiber sensors have attracted substantial attention for the monitoring of ammonia in gaseous phase given they provide an easy and fast means of continuous detection. The majority of the fiber optic ammonia sensor research efforts have been focused on the employment of Glass Optical Fiber (GOF) sensors, which primarily focuses on the detection of ammonia in the gaseous phase such as in air. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel technique for the fabrication of Plastic Optical Fiber (POF) sensors that are ideal for monitoring water delivery systems. POF sensors are more flexible and stronger mechanically than GOF sensors, and POF sensors are a more suitable choice for applications that require the use of long optical fibers, such as monitoring ammonia in the artificial water delivery systems. This fabrication technique is inexpensive, reliable, sensitive, and reversible. Advantages: -Good reversibility -Compact, lightweight, and relatively inexpensive -Immune to electromagnetic interferencePotential Applications:-Ammonia monitoring in artificial water delivery systems"
Sensitive Folate Receptor Detection by Immunomagnetic Diffractometry,"Despite the diversity of available malignant disease detection platforms, important challenges still remain in minimizing sensor size, reducing detection time, eliminating target-labeling requirements, minimizing signal amplification steps, and developing simple and inexpensive fabrication protocols.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an integrated approach for the rapid detection of the folate receptor (FR) using in situ assembled optical diffraction gratings in combination with immunomagnetic capture. With this approach, a detection sensitivity of 700 fM (20 pg/ml) was achieved without any fluorescent or radiolabels or any secondary signal amplification. This approach can be applied to other targets and has the potential to be a broadly applicable, highly sensitive analysis technique. Advantages:-Allows early detection of cancer-Sensitive to femtomolar concentrations-Simpler assay with lower detection limit compared to current standardPotential Applications:-Cancer Detection-Medical/Healthcare"
Peptide Silane Material,"Extracellular environments and signaling provides clues to the cellular mechanisms used to modulate cell development and differentiation. Biologically inspired materials to manipulate cellular differentiation are a potentially powerful tool for the development and implementation of many cell-based technologies, including automated cell culture, cell therapies, and cell fate or functioning in prosthetics and implantable devices. This technology is a material platform capable of integrating a more complex pattern of signals in space and in future work/time.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a simple ""one pot"" method of producing a peptide silane material that allows the presentation of multiple peptides at controllable relative concentrations. The material can support cell growth directly at the surface without the addition of soluble factors. This material can provide rich biological signals that are well defined, and cells can be induced to possess more mature phenotypic characteristics than a traditional two-dimensional culture. The material methods have been developed, and the materials have been synthesized and characterized for multiple peptides. A neuronal model system has been demonstrated and validated with the rat neuronal cell line. Additional material formulations have been designed that produce a more neuronal phenotype that has enhanced neurotransmitter production and release compared to control culture surfaces.Advantages:-Synthetic brain model-Functionalized for well-known rat cell line-Simple synthesisPotential Applications:-Biotechnology"
Microsensor Arrays for Bacterial Detection,"Concerns about biological warfare have piqued interest in sensitive detection of microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria. One method for detection of bacteria is to use the naturally occurring antibody-antigen chemistry to trap the bacteria onto a patterned substrate. Patterning the antibody into a microarray helps facilitate detection through a multitude of possible pattern recognition algorithms.Purdue University researchers have developed a new method for multi-threat bacterial detection that is rapid, economical, and offers the potential for mass production. They have extended the microarray concept from the field of proteomics to biohazard detection. This method incorporates an immunological assay platform capable of reagent free, real-time antibody based detection of a wide variety of aqueous borne biocontaminants. The immunological complex formation can be sensed directly using an array of submicron sensing elements, and thereby, permitting multiple-threat detection capabilities. It is anticipated that upon insertion of a biochip into a handheld device, a positive identification of biohazard will occur in real time.Advantages:-Multiple-threat detection capability-Positive biohazard identification in real timePotential Applications:-Biotechnology-Biosensors"
Second Generation Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors,"A type of mutated constitutively active protein, Ras, is seen in a significant number of cancers. There is a great deal of interest in preventing the Ras protein from localizing on cell membranes as an anticancer treatment. One way to prevent localization is to inhibit farnesyltransferase (FTase), the enzyme responsible for facilitating Ras attachment to the cell membrane. Traditional FTase inhibitors are highly charged and incapable of traversing the cell membrane to enter the cell. Purdue University researchers have developed a strategy for intracellular delivery of the monophosphates of such FT inhibitors, which could provide an effective therapeutic approach. Advantages: -Intracellular delivery of inhibitors -Enables absolute quantification of known compounds and relative quantification of unknown compounds in most cases using a single liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) runPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Cancer Treatment-Biotechnology"
Designer Collagen Fibers for Tissue Engineering Applications,"Collagen holds organs in place, binds cells together, confers appropriate mechanical properties for tissues, and provides a framework for the body. The ubiquitous influence of collagen makes it an attractive target for implantable and regenerative tissue systems; however, the use of natural collagen in tissue engineering applications is limited due to difficulty with precise control of scaffold structures. Furthermore, natural collagen aggregates are inherently inconsistent, complicating precise introduction of biomolecules such as growth factors and cell adhesion agents. Synthetic collagen alleviates these problems, but there is still a need to control the 3D architecture of collagen networks. Purdue University researchers have incorporated metal binding sites into small collagen peptides and used metal-ligand interactions to drive aggregation. Self-assembly of 3D structures is spontaneous, highly reproducible, and reversible. Fine, nanoscale detail and ultimate control at the single molecular level give rise to tunable shapes, sizes, and tertiary structures. Physical properties, such as mechanical strength, tensile strength, and porosity, may be modified in a predetermined way, as the physical properties of collagen play a central role in cell growth and differentiation. Reversibility of collagen aggregates, whereby aggregates are converted back to smaller subunits, may be advantageous for controlled release of drugs, cells, growth factors, etc. With aggregate structures so diverse, including spheres, nanospheres, hollow spheres, meshes, cages, microflorettes, fibers, and sheets, these designer synthetic collagen aggregates find applications across the spectrum. Advantages: -Control of 3D structure of collagen networks -Excellent biocompatibility and bioactivityPotential Applications:-Biotechnology-Materials"
Selective Capture and Identification of Bacteria,"Rapid identification of infectious pathogens is crucial in limiting the spread of contagious diseases. Unfortunately, current tests for most pathogens require hours or days of processing time. Antibody-based detection strategies have shown faster testing times, but become obsolete when the pathogen mutates its antibody binding sites. With the emergence of increasingly virulent strains of common pathogens, there is a need for new strategies with rapid turnaround times and the ability to detect mutated strains.Purdue University researchers have developed a novel technique for selective capture and identification of pathogenic bacteria using immutable ligands. These are pathogen-specific ligands that the disease-causing organism must bind to in order to remain virulent. Examples of immutable ligands include host cell surface molecules that the pathogen must bind to in order to infect its host and nutrient molecules that the microbe must internalize to survive. This method first immobilizes the immutable ligand onto a chip. When the chip is exposed to its matching pathogen, binding occurs. The chip can then be quantitatively evaluated using image processing algorithms, which are not only fast and accurate, but can also be used in a multiplex approach where a sample can be screened for a wide variety of pathogens simultaneously.Advantages:-Rapid multiplex test results-Detection invulnerable to pathogen mutationsPotential Applications:-Biotechnology-Toxin Detection-Medical/Healthcare"
Manipulator for Precise Interaction with Microscale Objects,"Micromanipulators, devices used to physically interact with samples under a microscope, are expensive and often require complicated piezoelectric systems or hydraulics for precise 3-D positioning of very small objects. These parameters limit the number of users and the availability of this technology, which is increasingly important for biomedical and engineering fields. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a mechanical micromanipulator that allows for precise gripping, positioning, and releasing of microscale objects without external power. This technology utilizes customized, disposable, silicon tweezer heads attached with a specially designed interface to a standard laboratory rotational input-translational output micrometer. Prongs in varying sizes can be used to manipulate different sized micro objects for specific end purposes. For example, the tweezer head can be treated with a biological entity, e.g., virus or DNA, and then brought into surface contact with cells under study, effectively implanting the biological entity within the cells. This micromanipulator operates with purely manual actuation, is simple to assemble and use, and therefore, provides accessible microscale manipulation technology for a wide range of disciplines including traditional engineering, biological engineering, and medicine. The device enables accuracy and sensitivity while eliminating complex and costly motors, amplifiers, and power supplies. Advantages: -Provides accuracy and sensitivity for microscale manipulation using only manual actuation -Cost effective and simple to assemble and use, utilizing standard micrometers -Requires no external power, wires, amplifiers, or electricity	Potential Applications:-Imaging-Microtechnologies-Nanotechnologies-Devices"
Improved Retroviruses for Gene Therapy,"Transducing cells with viral vectors to deliver novel nucleic acids requires a specific ligand or envelope glycoprotein on the virus surface to bind to a receptor on a target cell.  By changing the ligand on the virus (pseudotyping), it is possible to enhance the transduction efficiency towards target cell types.  For this technology, Ebola glycoprotein-pseudotyped retroviruses were produced for gene transduction into the lung and other tissues and for the study of Ebola virus entry into cells. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology that allows quantitative measurement of virus entry into host cells and determination of the effectiveness of reagents that inhibit entry.  This technology also allows for the production of Ebola glycoprotein-pseudotyped retroviruses with markedly improved titers, making the practical use of such viruses more feasible. Advantages:- Allows gene therapy of the lung using pseudotyped retroviruses- Improved safety and efficiencyPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-Antivirals-Gene/Cell Therapy"
Quantification of Affinity-Selected Glycopeptides,"Combinations of glycopeptides and glycoproteins are used in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of diseases and their causes in clinical, diagnostic, and discovery medicine. With some exceptions, current tests generally lack the necessary sensitivity and specificity for early and accurate diagnosis. Researchers at Purdue University have proposed an application of glycoprotein technology that greatly increases the specificity and sensitivity of serum tests for many types of cancer and other diseases. This novel method is used for stable isotope labeling and affinity selection of glycopeptides to identify serum glycoprotein changes. In addition to diagnosing and monitoring diseases, this method may also uncover novel targets for the development of therapeutics. Advantages: -Sensitive enough to detect cancers without biomarkers -Less complex and more sensitive than other methodsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug development-Drug targeting and screening"
Internalization of Anticancer Cargo by Bladder Tumor Cells,"Bladder cells are well protected and particularly difficult for topically applied therapeutic agents to penetrate.  Constant urine influx and periodic voiding of the bladder further limits the effectiveness of therapy.  Currently, instillation of live Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is most commonly used to increase penetration of therapeutic agents in the treatment of bladder cancer; however, administration of BCG is associated with high local morbidity and the potential for systemic infection.  There is a need for the development of safer, less toxic approaches to administer therapy.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an effective strategy to promote the internalization of anticancer cargo using the fibronectin attachment protein (FAP) from BCG to gain admittance to bladder tumor cells.  FAP binds strongly to targets on the surface of bladder tumor cells; it is subsequently internalized along with the chemotherapeutic cargo.  To combat the transitory nature of bladder contents, an antibody-induced microaggregation strategy is employed that promotes rapid internalization of FAP by bladder tumor cells.  Furthermore, FAP binding on the surface of bladder tumor cells is resistant to the acidic environment of the bladder.  These properties make it an excellent foundation for the design of more effective, less toxic bladder cancer therapies.Advantages:-High-affinity targeting of bladder tumor cells-Rapid internalization-Binding is resistant to the acidic environment of the bladderPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug development-Biotechnology"

Targeting T Cells in Tumor Microenvironments through Immunotherapy,"Researchers at Purdue University have created a ligand-targeted drug for reprogramming the body's immune system to eliminate cancer. This targeting strategy introduces a new frontier in medicinal chemistry and cancer therapeutics. Currently, cancer cells rather than immune cells in the tumor microenvironment are studied to develop therapies for solid tumors. However, immunoinhibiting regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are abundant in tumor microenvironments, can have greater potential to regenerate anti-tumor immunity. The approach developed by Purdue University involves the reprogramming of Tregs using of a targeting molecule with specificity for Tregs that can deliver an attached inhibitory drug solely to Tregs. Uptake of this inhibitory drug by the tumor Tregs then blocks the Tregs immunosuppressive properties and thereby allows the patient's immune system to eradicate the tumor. By targeting the therapeutic drug in this manner, the immunoinhibiting function of Tregs can be silenced without changing the immune system elsewhere in the body. Advantages:-Strong binding affinity-Small molecule treatment of tumors-Reprograms the immune systemPotential Applications:-Cancer Therapy-Molecular Medicinal Chemistry-Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing"
Mass Tag Analysis for Rare Cells and Cell Free Molecules,"There are many research methods related to rare cell identification given its importance to the early detection of rare diseases and cancer. Current research methods have specific problems, such as fluorescent tagging disrupts the chemistry of the cell, dilution methods lack accuracy, and mass tagging's minute scale of observation.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method of analyzing rare cells and molecules using mass tags, filtration, ionization, and mass spectrometry. Through ionization, heterogeneous fluids, e.g., blood samples, can be processed for a better mass reading once the samples go through an ordinary mass spectrometer. Since it is not an additive refinement process, there is no concern for the disruption of the cell's chemical makeup. This method can determine whether there is a presence of rare cells, identify the cells, and quantify the number of cells. With all of this data, more accurate diagnoses can be made.	Advantages:-Quantifiable data-No chemical alterationsPotential applications:-Molecule identification-Rare disease diagnosis"
Thermoelectric sensor for detecting viruses like SARS-CoV-2,Purdue University researchers have ideated a thermoelectric sensor which selectively identifies exothermic viral pathogen reactions utilizing the Seebeck effect. The sensor offers fast and precise readouts through detecting temperature changes through a voltage readout after interactions of pathogen antigen/antibody. Silicon material is used as the sensor's base material facilitating scale up through standard device fabrication processes. Modification of this technology to pathogen RNA/complementary DNA hybridization amplify the voltage change in patients with low viral load. This sensor can be used for a wide range of diseases with high epidemic potential increasing the utility.Advantages:-Fast and precise diagnostics-Label free viral detection-No RNA preparation needed-Easy scale-up manufacturingPotential Applications:-COVID-19 diagnostic-Epidemic testing
Collaborative Computing Platform for Health Data,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new method of collaborative cloud computing for electronic medical records. Current software databases used by healthcare providers, hospitals, and insurance providers must be translated between different programming languages and platforms in order to communicate patient needs. The Purdue researchers' approach integrates and aggregates vital data from Apache Hadoop, Jupyter Hub, Kubernetes, and Apache Hive databases into one system. This database architecture enhances parallelization, performance, and query processing time. The software program created by Purdue University improves data memory, mapping, and storage as well as local and global accessibility through an innovative authentication process. In testing with Center Health Fact data from 750 hospitals specific to over 69 million unique patients collected over the years 2000-2018, this tool was able to sift and report data with exceptional efficiency. Advantages:-Efficient-Cost-effective-Secure-Convenient-AccuratePotential Applications:-Healthcare-Insurance-Patient careCollaborative Cloud Computing Framework for Health Data with Open Source TechnologiesarXiv:2007.10498"
Human Monoclonal Folate Receptor Beta Antibody,"Folic acid is a vitamin required for the synthesis of DNA nucleotide bases and is essential for proliferation of all cells. To take in folic acid, some cells express a folate receptor that binds folic acid very tightly and carries it into the cell via endocytosis. There are four types of folate receptors: alpha; beta; gamma; delta, and these receptors are preferentially overexpressed on cancer cells.  Purdue University researchers have developed a method for using a human monoclonal antibody against beta folate receptors. By targeting cancer cells and binding antibodies to the beta folate receptors on those cells, researchers can block some of the beta folate receptors on the cells. This lowers the amount of folic acid the cancer cell is receiving and prevents its rapid proliferation. By attaching chemical groups to the antibody, e.g. therapeutics or imaging agents, this approach can be used to potentially treat or identify cancers. It is particularly useful for targeting of chronic and acute leukemia, and has potential to treat these disorders, along with immunological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Advantages:-Lowers the amount of folic acid cancer cells take in-Potential cancer treatment-Also treats inflammatory disorders"
Inactivation of Airborne Viruses using Aerosols or vapor of Photoreactive FDA-Approved Food Coloring Dyes ,"Purdue University researchers have developed a voluminous antiviral phototherapy technique that uses aerosols or vapor of FDA-approved food coloring dyes to mitigate risk of airborne transmission of pathogens. Many viruses and bacterial diseases are transmitted through air, making it critical to disinfect and sanitize large volumes of indoor air where many people are present. Contemporary disinfection methods include using biohazardous materials such as aerosolized hydrogen peroxide and cancer-causing UV illumination, limiting their utility indoors and exemplifying the need for biocompatible air sanitation methods in population dense areas. To address this need, Purdue University researchers have demonstrated visible light activation of several FDA-approved food coloring dyes generate singlet oxygen, which can be used to kill airborne pathogens. The short traveling distance of singlet oxygen (less than 300 nm) acts as a safeguard against human exposure. They have also ideated an electrostatic spray system for the dyes allowing for uniform fog-like dispersion to minimize wetting. In addition, as healthcare workers are often infected when removing personal protective equipment (PPE), this technology can be installed in a confined chamber for healthcare professionals to change PPE in hospital settings. Advantages:-Non-UV light Illumination-No Need for Carcinogenic Nanomaterials-Safe, Increase Reusability of PPE-Minimize Solvent UsagePotential Applications:-Healthcare-Hospital Acquired Infection Mitigation-Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)COVID-19 Pandemic"
N95 Filter/Mask Combination for Mitigation of Respiratory Disease Transmission,COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases spread through small aerosolized droplets produced by infected individuals. These small droplets stay suspended in the air for hours and can be inhaled by the non-infected populace leading to spread of the disease. Typical cotton masks/face coverings are not effective at stopping droplets from being inhaled or potentially spread by infected individuals. Purdue University researchers have developed a pocket containing mask/interchangeable filter combination which when used together provide more protection than cotton masks alone. The pocket functions as an insert location for the filter placed over the mouth of the wearer. These filters can be easily attached to other cotton masks/face coverings as well via provided tape or Velcro. The filter is made of antibacterial and superhydrophobic N95 material and provides a simple alternative to the N95 masks while using less resources to produce. Advantages:-Less Resource Intensive-Increased Protection from Respiratory DiseasesPotential Applications:-COVID-19 Pandemic-Respiratory Diseases-Healthcare System-Preventing Infection Spread
"Pod: An At-Home, Portable, Universal Allergen Detector","An Industrial Design student at Purdue University has developed a new allergen detector known as Pod to identify allergens in food items. Current technology is mainly focused on gluten or peanut allergies, and available kits for testing food items often involve microlaboratory setups that are inconvenient to use. The small, stylish design created by Purdue University features a magnetic backing for placement on a refrigerator and is also portable to carry for everyday use such as for restaurants or grocery stores. In addition, food labels can also be scanned by Pod to check for potential allergens, providing added peace of mind.

Deep Tissue High Resolution Neuroimaging,"Researchers at Purdue University have discovered a method for estimating the location of fluorescent targets that are embedded at millimeter and centimeter depths in biological tissue that enables imaging with very high spatial resolution. By combining the estimated location of many inhomogeneities, a super-resolution image can be formed. This invention has the potential to have a major impact on the study of brain science, because neuron activation can modulate fluorescence emission in space and time.Advantages:-Direct Access to Neuron Activation-Super-resolution of NeuronsPotential Applications:-Brain Imaging-Brain Disease Diagnostics"
Strain Gauge Integrated Magnetic Microactuator for Smart Self-Clearing Catheter,"Hydrocephalus is a neurological disease characterized by an excessive accumulation of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain. Treatment requires the implantation of shunts through which CSF can be drained from the brain.  However, the failure rate of these systems remain high, especially among children. According to the Journal of Neurosurgery, a study conducted from April 2008 to December 2011 reported that 33% out of 1036 patients experienced shunt failure. Common causes of failure include obstruction, over-drainage, and loculated ventricles.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an implantable catheter capable of obstruction detection and removal, device alignment, and flow rate measurement. Previously, Purdue researchers introduced a fully integrated self-clearing implantable catheter that was able to clear obstructions, but found that once the device was implanted it was impossible to determine whether the device was oriented properly or actuating as expected. With new additions, in real-time the catheter can detect obstructions, confirm device alignment, and measure the CSF flow-rate on top of the existing biofouling-removal capabilities of the microactuator in the catheter. This device has demonstrated the ability to solve one of the largest challenges that clinicians encounter with chronically implanted catheters. Advantages:-Obstruction Detection-Device Alignment-Flow Rate Measurement-Self-Clearing-Ease of FabricationPotential Applications: -Hydrocephalus Treatment"
Optical Detection Of Neurological Alterations,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new non-invasive technology to detect neurological alterations caused by disease and/or injury. The current Pupillary light reflex (PLR) tests are conducted by pen light exam, which tends to be heuristic, empirical, qualitative often leading to misdiagnosis due to human error. Even though there are some quantitative pupillometry devices that are available in the market, it is often associated with high startup cost and a work accurately under a narrow range of conditions. This PLR technology developed at Purdue uses elegant mathematical modeling to detect neurological alterations. It is compatible with any imaging platform and eye color. It delivers automated, accurate, objective measurements in real-time.Advantages:-Portable- Easy to use-Accurate- AutomatedPotential Applications:-Monitor neurological alterations due to disease and/or injury"
Adaptable Respiratory Rate Monitoring for Commercial Fitness Devices ,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed new signal processing techniques for measuring respiratory rates. Through algorithms that measure inhale and exhale frequency of patients as well as heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) can be determined. Unlike current technologies, this algorithm can be integrated into existing commercial fitness devices. The low-power, portable technology can also be implemented into Kangaroo Mother Care pouches for use in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). The system is found to operate at a rate between seven and thirteen breaths per minute, and showed improved modeling compared to other similar algorithms. The measures of baseline drift as well as QRS complex height for ventricle hypertrophy were enhanced by using the Purdue University approach. Advantages:-Low Power -Portable -Adaptable with existing devices -Accurate Potential Applications:-Fitness -Neonatal Care -Hospitals -Medical"
Repurposed Drug for Clostridium Difficile Infection,"Researchers at Purdue University developed a repurposed drug as a potent inhibitor of Clostridium difficile. Clostridium difficile is the most common and costly healthcare-associated infection with an estimated half a million cases and approximately 29,000 deaths occurring annually in the United States. The rate of death associated with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is rising, and the infection is occurring in populations previously considered to be at low risk. Treatment with the standard of care falls short; after treatment, patients' intestines become colonized by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The repurposed drug is capable of killing hypervirulent strains of C. diff, suppressing C. diff spore formation, preventing VRE colonization, and avoiding absorption from the intestine. The drug is approved for its original indication outside of the US for oral consumption and in the US for topical application.Advantages:-Kills Clostridium difficile-Suppresses Clostridium difficile spore formation-Reduces vancomycin-resistant enterococci colonizationPotential Applications:-Treatment of Clostridium difficile infection"
Method of Thin Flexible Electrode Insertion for Deep Brain Neural Recording and the Design of Electrode Insertion Device,"Inserting a device to record deep brain activity is not a new technology.  However, the current technology is not as efficient as it could be.  Some of the problems with the current technology include leaving a flexible electrode behind after completion of the recording, coating with biodegradable materials to increase stiffness, and using a magnetic field to obtain necessary energy to penetrate the brain.  All of these issues are very invasive to the brain that is being recorded and could potentially cause health issues for the individual.  There is a need for a less invasive way to record deep brain activity.  Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that allows for less invasive recording of deep brain activity.  This new technology allows for insertion of 25 um platinum electrode in the deep brain.  This electrode does not need any supporting tube, cannula, or biodegradable material to assist it in the recording of the deep brain.  This means it is much less invasive and cause minimal neuronal damage.  This new technology could open the door for recording deep brain activity. Advantages: -No support needed-Less invasive-Causes minimal neuronal damage Potential Applications: -Neurological studies-Brain surgery"
"Efficient, Wearable Body Heating and Cooling System","Researchers at Purdue University have developed an efficient thermoelectric, wearable body heating and cooling system device.

Furthermore, the thermoelectric generator can be operated by rechargeable battery(s) and can be used over several hours. Additionally, this technology can be used in a jacket or a vest in extreme weather conditions by soldiers, first responders, and others working outdoors.Advantages:-Wearable -Efficient -Battery operatedPotential Applications:-Sports and Sports Medicine -Military Thermal Wear-Cold Therapy-Pain Reliever -Vascular Enhancement"
MRSA Elimination,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a staph infection resistant to many antibiotics used to treat typical staph infections. According to Mayo Clinic Staff, there are two common types of MRSA: healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) and community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA). HA-MRSA tends to be the result of invasive procedures, e.g. device implantation. The latter, CA-MRSA, is spread through skin-to-skin contact, typically beginning as a painful boil. In addition, MRSA is considered to be even more life-threatening if combined with sepsis or necrotizing pneumonia. Because MRSA is drug-resistant, there is need for a method of prevention and elimination of the infection. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a drug-free approach to eliminating MRSA. Using blue-light bleaching, along with hydrogen peroxide, have shown to eliminate a MRSA culture and a MRSA infection of a mouse wound. This has shown to be a safe and effective method of eliminating MRSA.  Advantages: -Safe -Effective-Drug-free approachPotential Applications: -MRSA prevention-MRSA treatment"
Radiation-Controlled Release of Drugs for Chemo-Radiotherapy,"Over 60,000 new cases of head and neck cancer were diagnosed within the US in 2016, with 20 percent of these cases resulting in death. The current treatment of advanced head and neck cancer involves surgery followed by radiation, i.e. concurrent radiation, systemic chemotherapy, induction chemotherapy, or radiation alone. However, the surgeries are difficult, and radiation therapy afterwards is beneficial only for a few months. Conventional chemotherapy involves administering drugs through veins into the bloodstream, which involves high levels of toxicity and specific eligibility requirements. In addition, only 5 percent of the drug actually reaches the tumor site. There is need of a method for treating locally advanced tumors more effectively.     Researchers at Purdue University have developed a radiation-controlled drug release formulation. The formulation allows toxicity and side effects associated with radiation from chemotherapy to be minimized by co-encapsulating the drug within protective capsules and injecting the solution into the patient's tumor before receiving normal radiotherapy. The release rate of the drug is controlled by radiation dose and frequency, allowing maintained drug concentration within the therapeutic level and toxic threshold over an extended period of time. This technology would be used to help medical/surgical/radiation/interventional oncologists who want to apply chemo-radiotherapy to cancer patients with tumors safely and effectively without compromising their quality of life.  Advantages: -Controlled drug release-Minimized toxicity-Effectiveness-Longer lifespan Potential Applications: -Chemo-radiotherapy"
Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors as Treatment for Gonorrhea   ,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new treatment for the drug resistant pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae. CDC has reported a 67% increase in gonorrhoea cases, a sexually transmitted disease, between 2013 and 2017. Pathogenic strains of gonorrhea are notorious for rapidly developing resistance to the current line of antibiotic treatments rendering them futile. The new treatment developed at Purdue leverages FDA approved carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) to develop novel analogs that are potent with a narrow spectrum of action to treat gonorrhea. These analogs target the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase in the bacteria, which is crucial for the bacteria to maintain CO2 and pH homeostasis. They do not target other commensal bacteria that are required to maintain healthy microbiome. Most importantly, their mechanism of action prevents the development of rapid antibiotic resistance. Advantages:-Selectively targets N. gonorrhea-Does not target gut and/or vaginal microbiota-Prevents rapid resistance development-Works synergistically with approved antibioticsPotential Applications:-Treatment of Gonorrhea and treating medical conditions related to  antibiotic resistant strains of N.gonorrhoeae."
New Class of Anticancer Chemotherapy Agents,"According to the National Cancer Institute, approximately 40 percent of people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime and worldwide number of diagnostics are predicted to increase nearly 50 percent by 2030. Nearly 2 percent of all men and 1.5 percent of all women are killed each year by cancer. Cancer is simply described as continuous and uncontrolled division of cells leading to tumors. With the increase in cancer cases worldwide and the lack of a consistent treatment, new development are still needed in the field.Researchers at Purdue University have synthesized a number of natural products that inhibit cell splicing. These herboxidiene derivatives inhibit cell division through its interactions with the proteins responsible for pre-mRNA splicing. This technology shows potential for use in a variety of select human cancers with increased functionality and consistent stability and potency. Advantages: -Stable and potent-Appropriate drug functionalities for conjugates Potential Applications: -Pharmaceuticals-Anticancer, chemotherapy drugs"
New BACE1 Inhibitors for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"According to the Alzheimer's Association, nearly one in every nine Americans above the age of 65 have Alzheimer's disease. The causes of this disease are poorly understood and there is currently no cure for it. Current treatments may temporarily improve symptoms, but cannot stop or reverse the progression of this disease and their side effects include nausea, headaches, confusion and vomiting. There is a clear need for improvement in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Researchers at Purdue University have synthesized new compounds capable of improving current treatments of Alzheimer's. These compounds are of a stable BACE1 inhibitor, which has been shown to help treat the disease in mice. Compared to other BACE1 inhibitor treatments, this compound is selective, expected metabolically stable, and very potent. This would likely lead to the reduction of side effects from treatment, such as headaches and dizziness, because of the inhibitor's selectiveness. These compounds have vastly improved drug properties compared to other BACE1 inhibitors currently available.Advantages:-Very potent-Metabolically stable-Selective BACE1 inhibitorPotential Applications:-Treatment of Alzheimer's disease"
Electronic Healthcare Supply Chain Management for Developing Countries,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a healthcare inventory-tracking and supply chain management system to improve patient outcomes in developing countries. Paper-based healthcare supply chain management systems, commonly used in developing countries, have many limitations related to providing the up-to-date information needed for real-time decision-making. This lack of data can result in undersupply of pharmaceuticals, overstocks of expired medications, or delays in treatment. The Purdue software has a cloud-based centralized database structure supported by an offline-compatible mobile platform and is able to triangulate patient admission data, diagnoses, supply delivery information, testing reports and inventory information and generate reports accordingly. This software aims to reduce time needed to prepare orders, incidence of stock-out and overstock of targeted medical supplies, and ultimately help improve patient outcomes.Advantages:-Complete transparent tracking (from donor resources to beneficiaries)-Multiple organization and country program management-Automatic reports (for inventory, beneficiary, monthly, etc.)-Cloud-based (most up-to-date supply chain status, maintained and updated remotely)-Web-based (accessible from location without installing any App)-Cross-platform (Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, etc.)Potential Applications:-Healthcare in developing countries"
"Breathable, Paper-based Epidermal Electronics","Current manufacturing methods and materials for epidermal electronics are complex and expensive, which prevent their adoption as single-use medical devices. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a low-cost, omniphobic, paper-based wearable or implantable epidermal electronic to monitor health status. Whereas current metallic based skin-mountable or implantable devices are not breathable and short-circuit in high humidity situations, this porous, paper-based technology is not impacted by moisture changes and is highly breathable. Furthermore, this technology makes epidermal electronic devices accessible to high-throughput manufacturing technologies to allow the fabrication of a variety of wearable medical devices at a low cost. Advantages:-Breathable-Not impacted by moisture-Low-costPotential Applications:-Wearable or implantable epidermal electronics"
Novel Inhalation Formulation of Antimicrobials,"Antimicrobial therapy via the inhalation route has attracted increasing momentum for the treatment of lower respiratory systems. Inhalation therapy improves drug concentration on airway surfaces with reduced systemic exposure. Typically, the inhaled drug particles produced by the traditional jet-milling approach are highly cohesive and have poor flowability and aerosolization performance. Addition of excipients, such as lactose particles, may improve the aerosolization of cohesive powders; however, for high-dose drugs, like antibiotics, the addition of excipients may increase the inhalation powder mass that needs an excessive number of inhalations to complete the dose and a bulky inhaler to accommodate the large dose.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel inhalation formulation which shows superior antibacterial activity. Incorporation of this formulation is evidenced by an almost two-fold increase in aerosol delivery efficiency expressed as fine particle fraction. The synergistic antimicrobial activities and the increased aerosolization performance from this formulation will not only improve patient compliance by reducing the inhaled powder mass and minimizing local adverse effects, but will also have the potential to achieve superior therapeutic efficacy.Advantages: -Enhanced antimicrobial activity-Reduces inhaled powder mass-Minimizes local adverse effectsPotential Applications: -Dry powder inhalers-Respiratory infections-Antimicrobial therapy via inhalation"
"Anti-Angiogenesis Compound Targets Laminin Receptor in Cancer Cells
","Laminin receptor (37/67 LR) is a membrane protein when over-expressed can promote metastasis of cancer cells. This is due to the ability of 37/67 LR to promote blood vessel formation in tumors in a process called angiogenesis. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is an endogenous protein that can bind to 37/67 LR to inhibit angiogenesis. PEDF is a viable therapy for cancer patients but due to it being an endogenous protein there are enzymes present in the body that degrade it. As well as, peptide formulation for drug delivery is difficult due to protein stability. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a small molecule that elicits a similar response as PEDF when it binds to 37/67 LR. Upon binding to 37/67 LR, the hit compound, C3, modulated an anti-angiogenesis pathway that inhibited prostate cancer cell viability, proliferation, and migration. Due to C3 being a small molecule, it did not bind to PEDF proteolytic enzymes, thus, bypassing PEDF degradation process which could result in longer duration of action. C3 is a promising hit compound which has potential for future development as a lead compound for prostate cancer treatment.Advantages: -Anti-tumor-Anti-angiogenesis-Bypass proteolytic degradationPotential Applications: -Prostate cancer therapy-ChemotherapyRelated Publication: Charles Samuel Umbaugh Et al., A dock derived compound against laminin receptor (37 LR) exhibits anti-cancer properties in a prostate cancer cell line modelOncotarget, 2018, Vol. 9, (No. 5), pp: 5958-5978"
Higher Binding Strength of Surgical Sealant,"In a report published by MedMarket Diligence LLC in 2017, the United States accounts for 30% of the 114 million surgical wounds that occur every year worldwide. The traditional method of closing surgical incisions are staples and sutures. The major disadvantages of staples and sutures are pain, infection, and added trips to doctor to remove them. Medical professionals have an increasing interest in ways to decrease the risk of infection and eliminate the damage of healthy tissue near the surgical site. Surgical sealants are a promising technology that could hold incisions closed without mechanical support of sutures or staples. There are a few commercially available surgical sealants. Commercially available surgical sealants have poor elasticity and adhesive strength and, therefore, require mechanical support. A strong and elastic surgical sealant would not require additional support. A first generation sealant have addressed the elasticity problem with the development of their first generation surgical sealant.Recently, researchers at Purdue University have modified their their first generation surgical sealant to improve its adhesive strength. The adhesive strength was higher for the second generation in comparison to the first generation surgical sealant on pig skin at physiological conditions. The adhesive strength was also measured on aluminum and it was found that second generation was 130% stronger than first generation adhesive and 14,000% stronger than Tisseel (commercially available surgical sealant from Baxter). Advantages: -Decreased risk of incision infection-Decreased pain and scarring at surgical sites-High adhesive strength and elasticityPotential Applications: -Closing surgical incisions"
Evaluate Glucose Concentrations Using a Selective Condenser for Collection of Exhaled Breath Condensate,"While self-monitoring of blood glucose is critical to properly controlling diabetes, 67% of patients fail to monitor their glucose levels due to the inconvenience of collecting finger-prick blood samples. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a promising non-invasive sample for glucose monitoring purposes due to its highly controlled physiological regulation. However, this may reduce reliability because the concentration of glucose is diluted by additional water vapor and the inclusion of anatomical dead space air, causing a wide range of reported EBC glucose concentrations.  By selectively collecting only exhaled breath that has been exchanged with lung fluid, it is anticipated that a greater fraction of glucose can be collected in the condensate.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an automated and selective exhaled breath condenser for glucose monitoring. This is the first condenser of its kind to actually separate and exclude dead space air from lung fluid-exchanged air. The condensate collected from this device provides a robust sample for evaluating glucose concentrations without variable dilution factors from dead space condensate that could impact the reliability of the sample.Advantages: -Separates/excludes dead space air from lung fluid-exchanged air-Provides robust sample for glucose concentration evaluation-Improves reliability of glucose samplesPotential Applications: -Glucose monitoring-Glycemic control-Diabetes treatment"
Next Generation Probiotic that Improves Gut Health and Provides Protection against Enteric Pathogens,"Listeria monocytogenes is an opportunistic human foodborne pathogen responsible for severe systemic infection (listeriosis) which can lead to stillborn and premature births, as well as mortality in newborns, the elderly, and other immunocompromised individuals. Listeria monocytogenes is well adapted to survive in the harsh environment of the gut. Currently, there is no probiotic based protection against the Listeria monoctyogenes infection available.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a next generation probiotic bacteria that binds to intestinal epithelial cells with high affinity to the receptor protein Hsp60 on the intestinal surface. This reduces inflammatory response and prevents Listeria monocytogenes from entering the intestinal epithelial cell barrier. This probiotic bacterium improves gut epithelial barrier integrity and helps protect against disease. The number of pathogens that crossed intestinal cells is reduced significantly.  In mouse studies, 90% of mice were protected from the disease.Advantages: -Protects against L. monocytogenes-Improves gut epithelial barrier integrityPotential Applications: -L. monocytogenes protection-Chronic inflammatory conditions"
Selective Janus Kinase Inhibitors for Autoimmune Disease,"An estimated 24 million people in the United States are affected by autoimmune diseases, a group of diseases in which the patient's immune system attacks parts of their own body. One cellular pathway implicated in the pathology of autoimmune disease involves regulation of gene expression mediated by a family of four related molecules known as Janus kinases, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Because of their importance in disease, this family of kinases is the target of a number of drug molecules, two of which, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, have been approved by the FDA. Unfortunately, the approved drugs still suffer from a number of debilitating side effects. One source of these side effects is the lack of these drugs' selectivity among the four Janus kinases. A drug that inhibits only one of the four Janus kinases promises reduced side effects.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a series of molecules, based on a new JAK inhibitor scaffold, that display selective inhibition for different members of the Janus kinase family. One particular compound, designed for high potency and stability, exhibits very good activity and selectivity against JAK1, with 3.3 nM activity and 10 fold and 30 fold selectivity versus JAK2 and JAK3, respectively. These new inhibitors promise to give relief to sufferers of psoriasis, myelofibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases with a reduction in side effects compared to current therapies.

Chem. 2018DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00510Advantages: -Reduce side effects-Allow for more options in treatmentsPotential Applications: -Treatment of autoimmune diseases"
Intravascular Photoacoustic Tomography Assessment of Lipid Content in Arteries,"Photoacoustic imaging is a biomedical imaging modality based on the use of laser-generated ultrasound.  This technology has been improving for the last ten years.  Currently, other types of imaging like x-ray angiography or OCT have some problems including insufficient resolution or does not have enough depth or chemical information.  There is a need for a new technology that can improve photoacoustic imaging and make it a better solution than current imaging technologies. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that is a catheter-based intravascular imaging in the presence of luminal blood.  This technology allows doctors or preclinical researchers to get information about lipid deposit in arterial wall in vivo.  It does this by accurately and reliably assess the vulnerability of the artery.  This technology could greatly improve artery assessment by photoacoustic imaging in the future. Advantages: -Accurate assessment of artery-Reliable assessment of arteryPotential Applications: -Artery assessment-Photoacoustic imaging"
Acid Reflux Induced Laryngospasm as a Potential Mechanism of Sudden Death in Epilepsy,"There is growing evidence that laryngospasm may be linked to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). There are an estimated 3.4 million Americans, including 470,000 children, living with epilepsy. Approximately 30% of seizures cannot be controlled by medication, and uncontrolled seizures are the primary risk factor for SUDEP. The exact cause of SUDEP is unknown, but laryngospasm has been proposed as a potential cause; therefore, there is a need for research to explore the causes of laryngospasm. Researchers at Purdue University have developed research into the causes of laryngospasms and its link with epilepsy. This research confirmed that sudden death due to laryngospasm in the kainic acid model of epilepsy is always preceded by a certain mechanism, and a method to eliminate sudden death has also been developed. This knowledge may inform future research into sudden death epilepsy and may contribute to the hypothesis that has been presented. This mechanism may be important in other mechanisms of sudden death.Advantages: -Elimination of SUDEP-Inform future research-Important for other mechanisms of sudden deathPotential Applications: -SUDEP-Layngospasm"
Novel Gene Delivery Method,"In the current versions of bovine adenoviral vector system, only .6 kb deletion of the E1 region can be made in the bovine cell line.  Various versions of less prevalent human adenoviral vectors are tested for gene delivery and vaccine production.  The problem with these current versions is that they do not provide the best immune responses.  They are also not as efficient as they could be.  There is a need for a new technology that allows for better responses and increases the efficiency of adenoviral vector mediated gene delivery.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that supports the replication of bovine adenoviral vector with full E1 region deleted.  This allows foreign gene cassette capacity in the bovine adenoviral vector to be extended by 2kb.  Such deletion would allow for a much greater insert capacity of the foreign gene cassette containing one or more genes.  This new technology could potentially open the door for many new technologies pertaining to adenoviral vector mediated gene delivery and vaccine production.Advantages: -Provides better responses-More efficientPotential Applications: -Gene delivery-Adenoviral vectors-Gene therapy"
GaPpIX Conjugates Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy,Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common bacteria in the nose and on the skin of people and animals.  Is it often resistant to many common antibiotics and normally stays in the infected person's body.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to cure MRSA completely.  Current solutions use photosensitizers that cross cell membranes.  This way in ineffective and still leaves the MRSA bacteria in the infected person's body.  There is a need for a new technology that could potentially improve on the treatment of MRSA.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a drug that can be used against multidrug-resistant strains of MRSA.  This is done by using GaPpIX as a photosensitizer that can be targeted to CSHR-expressing bacteria for aPDI.  This IC50 of GaPpIX is well above 10 uM.  This GaPpIX is also much more potent than TMPyP in a head to head comparison.  This new drug could open the door for how treating MRSA is approached in the future. Advantages: -More potent than TMPyP-Anti microbial activity 60 uM or 0.06 uM Potential Applications: -Anthrax-Skin Infections
Liposomal Formulation of Combinational Antibiotics,Liposomal formulations have been developed for single drugs such as ciprofloxacin but not for combinational antibiotics. Liposomal formulations have shown significant less irritation to the respiratory tract and much better safety in previous clinical trials. Developing liposomal formulations for combinational antibiotics might be beneficial for the treatment of respiratory infections.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new liposomal formulation of combinational antibiotics for the treatment of respiratory infections. This new formulation incorporates two synergistic antibiotics to enable maximum bacteria killing against resistant pathogens while significantly reducing irritation to the respiratory tract.Advantages: -Maximum bacteria killing against resistant pathogens-Reduce resistance developmentPotential Applications: -Treatment of respiratory infections-Eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Martina: A Breastfeeding Simulation System,"Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce diabetes, obesity, and respiratory infections.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that mother's breastfeed their babies for six months.  Today, only 11.9 percent of babies are breastfed for this long. The main reason for this is mothers feel discomfort during breastfeeding.  Sore breasts and bleeding nipples are causing mothers to stop breastfeeding early and use formula.  Using formula is also a financial burden.  By breastfeeding, families could save $1200 to $1500 over the six month period.  There is a need for a way for mothers to properly learn how to breastfeed.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that can teach mothers the correct technique of breastfeeding to avoid the discomfort.  This technology is a breastfeeding simulation that gives mothers a realistic training session on the proper techniques of it.  It can teach them the proper way to hold the baby, proper orientation in which the baby should be held, and other important aspects that will reduce the discomfort to the nursing mother.  This simulation is hands on, providing a realistic baby and breast prosthetic for the mothers to practice using.  This system gives feedback, allowing the mother to adjust her technique until she gets it correct.  This technology could change how mothers approach breastfeeding. Advantages: -Hands-on training-Realistic simulation-Teaches correct technique Potential Applications: -Breastfeeding-Nursing mothers"
Antibacterial Agents Against Methicillin- and Vancomycin-Resistant Bacteria,"The discovery and development of antibiotics revolutionized health care in such a way that bacterial infections, which were otherwise deadly, could be treated; however, this was met with a rapid development of resistant bacterial strains that rendered many antibiotics ineffective. Consequently, millions of people are infected with drug-resistant bacterial strains yearly resulting in thousands of deaths. Efforts need to be directed towards identifying and developing novel structures as antibacterial agents with possibly novel mechanisms of action.Researchers at Purdue University have identified compounds with potent antibacterial activities. The most potent compounds inhibited growth of various-resistant Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Some compounds were active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA and VRSA respectively), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). Through resistance generation experiments it was revealed that MRSA could not develop resistance to one of these compounds.Advantages: -Compounds can kill methicillin and vancomycin-resistant bacteria-No resistance from MRSA-Potent activity against drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens	Potential Applications: -Pharmaceuticals/biotech companies-Animal medicine-Bacterial burden in skin wound infectionsRelated Publications:Clement Opoku-Temeng et al., N-(1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzamide analogs, bacteriostatic agents against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant bacteriaEuropean Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2018https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.06.023"
"Live Cell Conjugation Chemistry for Imaging, Sensing, Biomanufacturing, and Cell Therapy","Surface modification of live cells has many biomedical and therapeutic applications, such as live cell imaging and cell therapy. The current approaches have limitations including poor stability over time and incompatibility with mammalian cells due to toxicity. There is a need for a new technology that improves surface modification of live cells. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that enables surface modification of live mammalian cells. This cell-modification technology has applications in live cell imaging, manufacturing of cell therapies, enhancement of cells for therapeutic applications, cell-drug conjugation for enhanced killing of cancer cells, and drug delivery in a pH dependent manner to sites of inflammation. This technology conjugates small molecules, proteins, fluorophores, and PET tracers to live cells without nanoparticles or other vehicles.Advantages: -Conjugation to cell membranes without killing cells -Functionalizes living cells with components such as small molecules, proteins, fluorophores, and PET tracers -No use of nanoparticles or other vehicles Potential Applications: -Cell membrane imaging -Enhanced cell therapy-Production of therapeutic cells"
Bioactive Glass-Polymer Bone Regeneration,"A broken bone unable to heal on its own is considered to have experienced a critical size defect; 5 to 10 percent of breaks fall into this category. The use of one's own bone tissue is currently the best available option, except it requires two surgeries, the material available is limited, and there is a risk of donor-site morbidity. The other option is to use bone tissue from a donor or a cadaver; these offer more material, but there is a risk of disease transmission, reduction of osteoinductive properties, and lack of osteogenic cellular components. In addition, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are sometimes used to improve osteoinductivity, but these proteins have a short half-life and must be added in supraphysiological doses. Without BMPs, there is a risk of ectopic bone formation. There is a need for a safer, more beneficial approach to bone regeneration.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology for healing bone defects using bioactive silicate glass (BSG) and a 3D osteomimetic composite porous scaffold containing microspheres comprised of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). Unlike other bioactive glasses which increase local pH, this demonstrates fast dissolution and ion release without impacting local pH; in addition, this BSG also contains higher calcium and phosphorous content. The beneficial mechanical properties of PLGA are combined with the bioactivity of the BSG, introducing the possibility of BSGs replacing autografts, allografts, and BMPs.Advantages: -Requires fewer surgeries-Displays minimal risk for disease transmission-Retains the osteoinductive properties-Retains the osteoinductive cellular components-Eliminates the need for BMPsPotential Applications: -Bone regeneration-Fixing critical size bone defects-Elimination of ectopic bone formation"
Athletic Performance Insole Sensor,"Many non-contact sports injuries occur due to limited capabilities in measuring reaction forces on the foot. Force plates, the current method of three dimensional (3D) measurement, restrict athletes to lab environments; while both shear and normal force can be measured in this setting, the devices are too large and bulky to be practical for athletes in their everyday environment. Wearable, non-intrusive devices are only able to measure pressure and therefore neglect all shear forces. No sensor currently exists that can measure 3D forces at the foot without being obtrusive to the user. There is a need for a sensor that can measure both normal and shear forces on the foot while being practical in daily applications. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an insole sensor to provide a practical method of measuring the full range of forces on the foot. The insoles can be substituted into shoes to be non-intrusive to the user and be used during daily activities. In addition, the insoles encompass the sensor electronics to ensure resistance to elements such as water, dust, and wear. The versatility of this solution allows it to be used in any type of shoe depending on the intended sport. Trainers would likely use the sensor to measure athletic performance and understand ways to avoid non-contact injury.  Advantages: -Measures full range of forces-Versatile-Non-intrusive-Water/dust/wear resistantPotential Applications: -Analyze athletic performance-Non-contact injury prevention"
Arylnapthalene Vacuolar-ATPase Inhibitors,"Ebola and Marburg viruses are a filamentous RNA virus that causes severe hemorrhagic fevers.  Recovery from these viruses relies fully on the patient's immune response, because currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine or medicine available to the public yet.  These viruses are deadly and there is a need for a vaccine or some type of medicine that can treat these viruses better than what is available now. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a potential drug treatment for virus infections including Ebola and Marburg.  This technology relies on selective inhibition of virus entry by a chemotype that inhibits the host vacuolar-ATPase.  This will allow for the inhibition of the viral cell.  This technology also allows for the inhibition of a host protein which will be key in treating these two viruses, because protein is needed for the viruses to achieve infection and replication.  This new technology could open the door for how Ebola and Marburg are treated.Advantages: -Inhibition of the viral cell-Inhibition of a hostPotential Applications: -Viral entry-Antiviral agents"
Wearable Device for Monitoring Health/Activity Levels,"Existing wearable technology for monitoring activity also monitors heart rates using plethysmography; however, such technology cannot detect respiration or blood oxygenation levels from plethysmograph or from the wrist. Photoplethysmography uses an LED and photodiode to measure reflected light through human tissue. Existing heart monitors and pulse oximetry sensors worn on the finger use photoplethysmography; however, respiration and pulse oximetry have not been performed on the wrist nor is respiration detected from a finger. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a wearable device, i.e., watch, that detects respiration rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation using photoplethysmography. All physiologic measurements are obtained in a single, easy-to-access device that is worn on the wrist. In addition, it can monitor exercise and disease states, such as drug overdose, asthma, seizure, or other health issues, affecting respiration, heart rate, and/or oxygen saturation. In addition, this device calls for emergency response when a drug overdose is detected, breathing/heart rate stops, and/or oxygen saturation drops below an acceptable threshold. This technology makes advances beyond the popular wearable watch that monitors activity, by using technology that monitors an individual's physiologic state and disease state and calls for emergency response.Advantages: -Wearable on wrist-Physiologic measurements-Monitors and detects drug overdose and disease states affecting respiration, heart rate, and/or oxygen saturation -Calls for emergency response-Potential integration with existing technologyPotential Applications: -Monitor health/activity-Detects respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation -Detects drug overdose"
Accelerated Degradation of Pharmaceuticals and Related Chemical Processes,"Forced degradation is an accelerated method of studying the stability of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in order to predict the shelf life of the drug. Forced degradation studies of APIs are an important aspect of pharmaceutical development. Typical forced degradation methods take one to seven days to complete and are then followed with product analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). These methods are time consuming and costly. There is a need for a more efficient method of forced degradation.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new forced degradation method.  Using Leidenfrost droplets to accelerate forced degradation and nanospray mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize the reaction products, the reaction/analysis sequence provided results within minutes, i.e., five minutes, versus taking up to a week to complete. The FDA requires forced degradation for licensing, which causes a bottleneck in pharmaceutical production. An accelerated forced degradation method could help eliminate this bottleneck.Advantages: -Faster-More efficient-Reliable-Potential to speed up FDA licensing processPotential Applications: -Pharmaceutical industry-Drug development"
Enhanced Drug Delivery Across Epithelial Barrier,"One of the most common practices of drug delivery is by the oral route. However, overcoming the gastrointestinal epithelial barriers is the major challenge for efficient delivery of drugs. Besides the intracellular route or passive diffusion, the paracellular route can be exploited by using a bacterial peptide for enhanced delivery of drugs through the epithelial barrier to reach the underlying lamina propria and submucosal compartment. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an approach for enhanced delivery of drugs through the intestinal epithelial barrier to reach the underlying propria and submucosal compartment. The use of the Listeria adhesion protein (LAP) enhances permeability through the intestinal barrier. This technology would be suitable for enhanced delivery of a variety of drugs across the mucosal epithelial barrier.Advantages: -Enhanced permeability-Improved efficiencyPotential Applications: -Drug delivery-Pharmaceutical companies"
Wearable Biometric to Predict and Prevent Preeclampsia and Hypertension,"Preeclampsia (or pregnancy related hypertension) is the most common complication to occur during pregnancy. It accounts for over $2.18 billion of U.S. health care expenditures in the first 12 months after birth. Of the 131 million pregnancies per year (4 million in the United States), approximately 10 percent are complicated by hypertension, leading to 3 million premature births. New insights suggest compromised blood flow through the kidneys plays a fundamental role in the development of preeclampsia. Researchers at Purdue University are refining a wearable biometric intended to screen for compromised kidney blood flow in 100 percent of pregnant women with the goal of predicting and preventing preeclampsia. Symptoms of preeclampsia can include high blood pressure, protein in the urine, swelling, and seizures. After the 20th week of pregnancy, the mass of the pregnant abdomen is well known to affect kidney blood flow, especially when a woman lies on her back. In women with a vulnerable anatomy, this compromised blood flow leads to high blood pressure. Previously published work has shown that an acute elevation in blood pressure associated with a pregnant woman shifting from her side to her back predicts approximately 90% of preeclampsia. The procedure is known as the supine pressure test (SPT). Furthermore, when detected early, rest in a therapeutic position, on one's side for example, has been shown to prevent preeclampsia. Purdue University researchers have developed a wearable biometric intended to both predict preeclampsia and better manage those women identified to be at risk. The technology couples a blood pressure measuring device with a body position sensor to ensure meticulous execution of the SPT. The device transmits via smartphone the changes in blood pressure and calculated predictive risk to a remote medical location. Sequential testing is intended to optimize test sensitivity. For those women identified to be at risk, the wearable device is also programmed to monitor a pregnant woman's resting position and communicate with her as needed to optimize position. The goal is to better predict and prevent preeclampsia and to allow expecting mothers to monitor their own health without frequent travel to a clinic.Advantages:-Predicts, manages, or prevents preeclampsia-Testing performed in the comfort of home-Results transmit to remote medical professionals-Affordable-PortablePotential Applications: -Early detection and prevention of preeclampsia-Reduce the number of premature births resulting from preeclampsia-Allow expecting mothers to monitor their own blood pressure without traveling to a clinic for frequent monitoring-Similar application available for those with obesity-related hypertension, since physiology has been shown to be similar. U.S. hypertensive population is 76 million."
Performing Human Movement Assessments Using Video Game Technology,"Commercial motion capture systems now offer systems that require no instrumentation and allow movement tracking without having to use markers or tracking suits. However, these systems are prohibitively expensive, require technical expertise, take up a large volume of space, and often require the analysis of movements by users before outcome measures are available. In general, this technology is not widely adopted in the clinical field despite some advantages over commercial motion capture systems that require instrumentation. The high cost, low portability, and required expertise associated with commercial motion capture systems frequently used in human movement research, does not afford its use in clinical settings.In general, physical and occupational therapists use visual inspection of posture or movement or handheld goniometers to assess patients in a clinical environment. Unfortunately, this limits a clinician's ability to incorporate more comprehensive examinations of posture and gait that may reveal subtle alterations to the underlying health and functional status of the neuromuscular system.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a software application that will serve as a tool for clinicians to measure and monitor body movements using an affordable, portable device, the Microsoft Kinect*. The application's design allows physical and occupational therapists to supplement movement assessments with more comprehensive metrics than currently available. In addition, features, such as longitudinal tracking of patient progress, will provide clinicians the opportunity to view how their patients are progressing under their current regimen. The proposed technology will provide an affordable interface for clinicians to carry out rigorous examinations of a patient's movement without adding significant time to their visit or diverting time away from their rehabilitation regimen. Advantages:-Uses existing technology-Affordable-Portable -Easy to use-Simultaneous evaluationsPotential Applications:-Physical and occupational therapists-Clinical evaluations-Therapy progression*Trademark"
Determination of IsoAspartate in a Peptide,"In vitro and in vivo isomerization of aspartate (Asp) to isoaspartate (isoAsp) is one of the main routes to protein degradation. Deamidation of asparagine (Asn) can also yield isoAsp via a common succinimide intermediate. Not only can this transformation change the structure and activity of a protein, it can also lead to immunological response. Furthermore, an increase in endogenous isoAsp has been linked to Alzheimer's disease and aging. The body naturally produces enzymes that work to reduce the levels of isoAsp, namely PIMT and PCMT, both of which methylate isoAsp to encourage isomerization to Asp. The spontaneous, post-translational generation of isoAsp poses an immediate problem to the development of protein-bound pharmaceuticals, where shelf life and activity may be directly affected; in fact, isoAsp generation is one of the most common contributors to heterogeneity in a protein-bound drug. Factors that induce the generation of isoAsp include pH, secondary and tertiary protein structure, and formulation. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a fast and inexpensive method to determine isoaspartate by chemical derivatization in the backbones of peptides by ionizing labeled peptides. This method is the simplest and most accessible assay for isoAsp determination, which makes it useful to researchers studying its link to disease or drug-bioconjugate degradation.  Advantages: -Fast -Inexpensive-Easily accessiblePotential Applications: -Research related to isoAsp's link to disease or drug-bioconjugate degradation-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical industry"
Mask Coupling Apparatus for Securing a Mask to a Helmet,"Traditionally, a user who needs to wear both a mask and a helmet will wear the mask straps over their head with a helmet worn over-top of the straps. This requires that the helmet be removed to adjust the straps. Additionally the adjustment mechanisms are sliding tables, which are difficult to adjust when worn in the field, particularly when wearing gloves. As a result, the adjustment of masks is difficult and time-consuming. Users have suffered with the adjustment mechanisms causing discomfort such as pressure points and headaches from poor fitting equipment.NSWC Crane has developed and patented a coupling apparatus for attaching a mask to a helmet with easier adjustments for fit while in the field. The coupling method reduces fatigue because there are fewer contact points with the mask wearer. The quick release buckle allows the wearer to detach one side of the respirator."
Smartphone Application Measures Postural Sway,"Postural sway controls the body's weight distribution around its center of mass. Its deviation from normal can be a symptom of a variety of neuromuscular and vestibular disorders. Despite the importance of sway assessment, current technologies used to collect these movements are either too expensive and/or too difficult for the general public to operate outside of a lab environment. Wearable devices that measure human movement can enable daily sway assessment using inexpensive and easier to use sensors.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a mobile system based on a widely available platform (smartphones) and a custom-designed image processing software for human movement and sway assessment. This is a low cost, easy-to-use design that is portable and provides accurate assessments. Older adults, athletes, and others suffering from balance disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, can use this technology. An additional use includes as a screening tool for concussion and/or traumatic brain injury for both athletes and military personnel. It offers the advantages of daily measurement by the end-user. Advantages: -Easy-to-use-Low cost-Accurate-Daily measurementsPotential Applications: -Older adults-Balance disorders such as Parkinson's disease-Screening tool for concussions and/or traumatic brain injury for both athletes and military personnel"
Multidrug-Resistant HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors,"According to the Centers for Disease Control, an estimated 1.2 million people in the United States live with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 1 in 7 are unaware that they have it. HIV is a virus that weakens the immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. There is currently no cure for HIV, but it can be controlled. If HIV is not treated, the virus can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS usually occurs in the last stage of HIV when the development of cancer and other diseases take advantage of the weakened immune system. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the most effective treatment for HIV. Unfortunately, drug side effects and the emergence of drug resistance have reduced the effectiveness of ART.Researchers at Purdue University have developed new compounds that have been shown to maintain potency against multidrug-resistant HIV variants. These compounds are novel protease inhibitors, but unlike current protease inhibitor drugs, these compounds bind to the protease backbone very tightly, exhibiting improved drug resistance. Many inhibitors in the current series have shown exceedingly potent enzyme inhibitory and antiviral potency. This class of inhibitors may exhibit much improved pharmacological properties compared to darunavir and other FDA approved inhibitors. Advantages: -Increased antiviral potency-Potent enzyme inhibitor-Improved pharmacological properties-Maintains potency against multidrug-resistant HIV variantsPotential Applications: -Pharmaceuticals-Treatment option for HIV/AIDS and specifically for multidrug-resistant HIV variants -Medical/Health"
Simultaneous Treatment of Alcohol Use and Psychiatric Disorders,"Alcohol use disorder is a chronic relapsing condition that includes alcohol withdrawal syndrome and is frequently comorbid with chronic pain disorders and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. There are only a few drugs approved to treat alcohol use disorder. Their only goal is to reduce alcohol cravings. They do not treat psychiatric disorders. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology for treating alcohol use disorder. In addition to targeting reduced alcohol intake, it simultaneously treats depression. This new treatment is meant to help patients suffering from both alcohol use and psychiatric disorders. This treatment should exhibit much fewer side effects and improved efficacy when compared to currently available treatments. Advantages:-Simultaneously treats alcohol use and psychiatric disorders-Exhibits fewer side effects -Improved efficacyPotential Applications: -Patients suffering from both alcohol use and psychiatric disorders-Alcohol treatment centers-Hospitals"
Improved Nanoparticle Based Targeted Drug Delivery to Cancerous Cells and Tissues,"Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth. Currently there are more than 100 types of identified cancer that affect human beings as well as animals. In 2016, there were an estimated 1,685,210 new human cancer cases diagnosed and 595,690 cancer deaths in the United States alone (Cancer Statistics 2016 - American Cancer Society, Inc.). Nanoparticles (NPs) have been considered a promising carrier of chemotherapeutic drugs, but are limited in delivery to tumors due to the diverse nature of the disease. There currently exists the need to leverage the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deliver NPs beyond the current levels possible.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for preparing polyol-modified nanoparticles for targeted delivery to cancerous cells and tissues via transcytosis across the peritumoral endothelium. This method does not depend on the leakiness of the vasculature like traditional nanoparticle formulations, but actively interacts with the vascular lining to enter tumors.Advantages:-Increases the amount of drugs deliver to solid tumors-Reduces the required dose and related side effects-Does not depend on long-term circulation and passive extravasationPotential Applications:-Cancer treatment-Drug deliveryRelated Publication:Quinic Acid-Conjugated Nanoparticles Enhance Drug Delivery to Solid Tumors via Interactions with Endothelial SelectinsSmall 14 (50), 1803601DOI: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.201803601"
Diffusive Optical Imaging of Arteries and Lesions in the Mouth for Assisting Oral Surgery ,"The greater palatine artery (GPA) is an anatomical landmark for oral surgery. Currently, a surgeon must rely on prior knowledge of the GPA location to avoid damaging it or surrounding nerves. Unfortunately, studies suggest that there can be a discrepancy of up to 4 mm and this uncertainty can cause a variety of surgical complications and injuries. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method to image arteries and lesions in the roof of the mouth. The technology described uses the contrast in optical properties between the arteries or lesions and the surrounding tissue to locate the GPA and lesions that are not visible to the naked eye. This allows for their exact location and depth to be computationally identified. In addition, researchers can print images of the artery on a surface mask that covers only the regions of tissue above the artery, providing surgeons a guide to areas of the mouth to avoid.  Custom surgical tools of limited length that could not damage the artery can be printed.Advantages:-Reduces likelihood of artery and nerve damage-Computationally identifies the exact location and depth of the GPAPotential Applications:-Custom surgical tools-Oral surgery"
Energy Efficient Electrode Design to Treat Neurological Disorders,"Numerous neurological impairments, including neuromotor deficit, hearing loss, chronic pain, and epilepsy, require the restoration and replacement of bodily functions by virtue of implantable neuroprosthetic devices. Advancements in neuroscience have increased the total market size considerably for various neural stimulation devices that target the spinal cord, cochlear, cerebral cortex, and other peripheral nerves. With advances in neurostimulation technologies, the demand for more precise targeting of neural substrate has fueled the development of higher density electrode arrays to improve the resolution of stimulation outcomes while minimizing unwanted side effects; however, chronic overstimulation is known to cause nerve damage. There is a need for developing higher efficiency, more durable electrodes.Researchers at Purdue University have developed new electrode designs to prolong the lifetime and function efficacy of implantable pulse generators. It was found that certain shapes can be used to more efficiently deliver electrical charge for stimulating the nervous system. Data shows that the electrode design reduces power consumption by up to 50 percent while increasing functionality effectiveness. This new electrode design could be used in implantable simulation systems that are used to treat a large number of neurological disorders. It will work in existing platforms or in a standalone system. Advantages: -Energy efficient-Increases lifetime of system-Increases functionality effectiveness-Compatible with existing platformsPotential Applications: -Implantable neuroprosthetic devices-Implantable pulse generators-Other implantable devices"
Synthetic Mimics of Malonyl-CoA as Fatty Acid Synthase Inhibitors,"Fatty acids are essential components of overall cellular metabolism. Malonyl-CoA is a coenzyme known to play a key role in the synthesis of fatty acids. Inhibition of malonyl-CoA results in defects in the biosynthesis of fatty acid. Development of such specialized inhibitors have applications in medicine. Therefore, there is a need, especially in medicine, for specialized inhibitors.Researchers at Purdue University, with various manipulations of malonyl-CoA, developed synthesized molecules that inhibit enzymes related to fatty acid synthases. These inhibitions may be the solution to treating bacterial infections, cancer, and obesity related diseases. These inhibitors are unique in that they can be modified to inhibit fatty acid metabolism in a specific organism. Advantages: -One inhibitor has the potential to treat bacterial infections, cancer, and obesity related diseases-Custom modification for single organismsPotential Applications: -Treating drug-resistant bacteria-Cancer treatment-Treating obesity related disease"
Muscle Progenitor Cells  Enhance Innervation,"Denervation, the loss of nerve supply in muscle fibers, occurs from a variety of causes ranging from serious physical injury to chronic disorders. This disruption in nerve fibers may cause flaccid paralysis, eventually leading to severe muscle atrophy. Following a major injury that results in denervation, the physical muscle tissue may heal, but without an adequate, functioning nervous system connection, no effective physical movement can be made. Research in this area has shown that if the damage is contained to certain nerves, the brain might rewire neurological circuitry and resume somewhat normal function. Unfortunately, in cases of muscle denervation, effective physical muscle movement cannot naturally be reversed.  A Purdue University researcher has developed a toolkit and a method for repairing and reconstructing a damaged or nonfunctional muscle using in vitro primed muscle progenitor cells to promote innervation of the damaged or nonfunctional muscle without any genetic manipulation. Muscle progenitor cells are harvested and grown to a critical mass in culture. The cells are then injected into the damaged or nonfunctional muscle and fuse with native muscle fiber. Following the injection, the muscle is innervated, atrophy has been shown to reverse, and the muscle fibers have an increased force of contraction.Advantages:-Does not use genetically modified cells-Allows the body to naturally regrow nerve connections-Clinically translatablePotential Applications-Innervation-Muscle repair-Tissue engineering"
Compounds with Promising Antibacterial and Antifungal Activity for New Therapeutic Development,"Invasive fungal infections are a serious cause of mortality in many patients including an increasing number of immunocompromised patients. Few treatment choices exist and first-line therapies have significant limitations due to safety problems and the lack of broad-spectrum activity. There is a need for novel antibacterial/antifungal agents and efficient methods of making these agents. Researchers at Purdue University have identified several compounds with novel structures that indicate promising antibacterial and antifungal activity. Researchers evaluated the compounds against important bacterial, yeast, and mold pathogens. Preliminary results demonstrated promising activity against toxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile. The compounds did not show a side effect on beneficial intestinal microflora and were nontoxic. Researchers are currently preparing analogues of the antibacterial and antifungal lead compounds to improve potency and physicochemical properties for new therapeutic development.Advantages: -Efficient -No effect on beneficial intestinal microflora-NontoxicPotential Applications: -Pharmaceuticals-Drug development-Treatment for fungal and bacterial infections"
Rope Climbing Machine for Exercise and Strength Training,"The U.S. Navy seeks a partner for licensing and collaboration on a rope climbing method for use in compact space without enough height to install a traditional climbing rope. Traditional rope climbing requires 20ft or more of height to provide any real exercise or training when climbing. Often it is not practical to install a rope in a gym or training facility due to high constraints. Additionally, it is a safety hazard to have inexperienced climbers at that height without harnesses and safety lines. There are some existing rope climbing machines, but they require supported positions and/or power outlets. NSWC Crane has developed and patented a rope climbing machine with a continuous rope and a variable braking system that can be used for fully suspended rope climbing technique practice and exercise. The machine can be used in a room with standard ceiling heights which prevents the necessity of having extra safety measures. The variable braking systems allows the speed to be customized for individual users."
Diagnostic Panel of Modified Proteins for Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women in the U.S. and Europe and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American women. Early intervention and treatment will produce healthier, more successful outcomes for patients. Diagnostic markers are important for prognosis, diagnosis, and monitoring disease and changes in health status. Diagnostic markers are important for predicting and monitoring response to treatment and selecting appropriate treatment. Identifying these health issues accurately is extremely important for correct treatment.  Improved diagnostics would greatly improve the health of these women. Unfortunately, there are currently no effective biomarkers reported that can differentiate between a benign or malignant breast lesion or tumor that has been visually detected by an imaging method.   Researchers at Purdue University have developed a diagnostic panel of modified proteins for breast cancer. The breast cancer diagnosis may be a determination of whether a breast tissue lesion or tumor is benign or malignant. The diagnostic breast cancer panel provides a method for diagnosing a malignant tumor based on a blood test. Using this diagnostic method as a screening test is a promising advancement for people who are susceptible to developing breast cancer, need periodic monitoring after surgery, or possess a high genetic risk for the disease. Early diagnosis and identification of the disease and changes in health status may permit earlier intervention and treatment that will produce healthier, more successful outcomes for patients.Advantages:-Breast cancer diagnostic markers-Distinguishes between benign or malignant tumors and skin lesions-Early diagnosis may permit earlier intervention and treatmentPotential Applications:-Breast cancer screening test-Breast cancer diagnostic test-Monitor treatment effectivenessRelated Publications:Chen, I-Hsuan, et al. Phosphoproteins in Extracellular Vesicles as Candidate Markers for Breast Cancer. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 2017, 114 (12), pp 3175-3180.

Novel Conformationally Constrained Memapsin 2 Inhibitors for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"The processing of a precursor protein by memapsin 2 (beta-secretase, BACE 1) is the first step in the pathway leading to the production of Alzheimer's disease-causing amyloid-beta; thus, it is a major target for the development of inhibitor drugs used in the treatment of this disease.  A Purdue University researcher has designed a series of novel memapsin 2 inhibitors that incorporate conformationally constrained cyclic amine derivatives in place of conventional hydroxyethylamine isostere-derived inhibitors.  These inhibitors' design improves pharmacological properties of drug forms, improving metabolic stability, oral bioavailability, and in vivo A-reductions. 	Advantages:-Improved pharmacological propertiesPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical industry"
Smart Contact Lens for Therapeutic Applications,"Soft contact lenses could offer an ideal platform for a broad range of devices ranging from medical devices offering ocular pain relief or drug delivery to augmented reality. Unfortunately, until recently, any combination of soft contact lenses with sensors, actuators, or any other semiconductor technology was not possible because current semiconductor processing requires a rigid, planar surface, which is not compatible with the soft, curved shape of a contact lens.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for attaching sensors and other small devices to the soft, curved, silicone-based structure of a soft contact lens. This cutting-edge technology utilizes semiconducting nanomaterials, as well as metallic and insulating traces, to serve as a thermal actuator, a wireless power supply, and an array of sensors. Purdue researchers have used this new therapeutic contact lens system to unclog meibomian glands, the primary cause of dry eye syndrome, via the controlled application of heat to the clogged ducts. With the ability to combine soft, silicon-based contact lenses with a variety of different semiconductor devices, numerous advanced eye care applications are now possible. Advantages:-Noninvasive-Appears to be a standard contact to an observer-Improved eye carePotential Applications:-Treatment of dry eye syndrome-Augmented reality-Flexible ocular medication platform"
Humanlike Smart Electronic Gloves for Prosthetic and Robotic Controls ,"There are approximately 2 million people in the United States that have undergone an amputation and thus require a prosthetic, with an estimated 185,000 new amputees every year (Advanced Amputee Solutions LLC). Prosthetic development has advanced over the past 10 years, but there still remains many issues with the current generation of prosthetics. The advancement of prosthetic hands is of particular concern given the importance of social touch such as handshake, gentle strokes and pats, and even high fives. Disfigurement of the hands affects psychological well-being. Current prosthetic hands allow for artificial skin, but complex geometries lead to poor mechanical/electrical couplings, limiting humanlike social touch.A Purdue University researcher has developed an electronic glove (e-glove) in which various commercial gloves can serve as a platform for functional sensors. It can work with existing prosthetic hands by utilizing their intrinsic ergonomic designs.  In addition, the e-glove incorporates the mechanical softness and physical warmth to replicate humanlike social touch. Advantages:-Simple solution-Fits all prosthetic hands-Improved humanlike social touchPotential Applications:-Prosthetic hand improvement-Assistive robotic hand improvement-General prosthetic development"
Biosensor for Detecting Viscosity Changes,"When pharmaceutical preparations are improperly stored, drug safety and efficacy need to be monitored to ensure that the pharmaceutic delivers its intended effect and to prevent potential illness from degraded product. Current screening platforms for the stability of protein-based biopharmaceuticals in high throughput and low volume are unavailable outside of production and quality control laboratories. Miniaturized platforms for analyzing biopharmaceutical degradation could provide significant advantages to current macroscale systems. These include the ability to assess the quality of a pharmaceutical either during development, at distribution points, at the clinic, or within patient homes. Researchers at Purdue University have developed and designed miniaturized platforms for analyzing biopharmaceutical degradation. This technology provides significant advantages to current macroscale systems and allows for rapid testing of pharmaceuticals outside of the quality control laboratory using small sample volumes. The method has been proven with several different biopharmaceutical formulations and can discriminate as little as 5 percent degradation of insulin in a solution. This technology is a new tool for biopharmaceutical analysis and could readily be implemented at key points of the pharmaceutical delivery chain. Advantages:-Requires only a small sample to test-Eliminates the need for lab testing-Eliminates waste by discriminating degraded vs. intact product-Eliminates risk of using inactive biopharmaceutical for patientsPotential Applications:-Insulin testing-Biopharmaceutical efficacy tests"
Enhanced Imaging Using Vibrational Photoacoustic Tomography ,"Atherosclerosis is a degenerative disease that causes plaque accumulation in the arterial wall that can eventually inhibit blood flow to various tissues and organs. Patients may experience pain when walking and decreased wound healing, which can lead to amputation. In more serious conditions, plaques can rupture, leading to a blood clot that can induce a stroke or heart attack. Aneurysms, on the other hand, occur when the artery wall weakens causing the vessel to bulge. Aneurysms may remain silent or rupture, causing internal bleeding and even death. Diagnosing, treating, and managing atherosclerotic-related diseases represent a significant cost to society. Established methods of diagnosing and monitoring atherosclerosis have limitations such has high cost, long imaging times, and may be minimally invasive. Atherosclerosis-related diseases also have high recurrence rate of between 10 and 20 percent during the first 12 months after treatment. Taken together, these unmet clinical problems suggest that better imaging techniques are needed to cost effectively monitor atherosclerosis progression before, during, and after therapeutic and surgical interventions.Vibrational Photoacoustic Tomography (VPAT) is an emerging imaging method that utilizes pulsed laser light to induce acoustic waves and obtain tissue-specific compositional information. When used in combination with ultrasound, VPAT has the potential to identify the location, size, and distribution of lipids in vivo. This is especially important in atherosclerosis diagnosis, as better techniques are needed to identify and characterize plaques in high-risk and asymptomatic patients. Researchers from Purdue University have developed a photoacoustic probe that allows for improved imaging of tissue. This technology has the ability to rapidly, non-invasively, and cost effectively locate and quantify plaque composition in vivo. VPAT has the potential to be used in the clinic to study atherosclerosis plaque development, evaluate the effectiveness of prospective therapeutics, and improve the diagnosis of atherosclerosis or related vascular diseases.Advantages:-Disease tracking-Does not require contrast agents-Rapid in vivo imaging capabilities-Potential for 3D imaging-Estimated cost is lower than conventional imaging techniquesPotential Applications:-Therapeutic research-Diagnosis of atherosclerosis or related vascular diseases-Determine treatment options"
Synthetic Lung Surfactant for Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) causes nearly 40 percent of premature infant deaths worldwide. A lack of natural surfactant in their under-developed lungs is the initial cause of RDS. Treatment is not readily available for RDS in developing countries because conventional surfactant replacement therapy uses animal-derived surfactants that are costly to produce, must be carefully stored, and require highly trained practitioners to perform a sophisticated delivery procedure.Researchers from Purdue University have developed a synthetic polymer-based surfactant to treat RDS by supplementing the premature infant's naturally produced surfactants. The synthetic lung surfactant, proven effective by in vitro measurements using a lung-mimetic device, will be less expensive to produce and store and will not require delivery by skilled physicians. This simple, cost effective surfactant is a promising treatment to decrease the mortality rate of premature infants worldwide.Advantages: -Less costly to produce and store-Less variation in production versus current animal-derived surfactant-Treatment option for developing countries Potential Applications: -Respiratory distress syndrome"
Skin-Mounted Sweat Sensor,"The state of hydration in humans is a delicate physiological parameter with direct effects on body function at the cellular, organic, and systemic levels. Studies have shown that deviations as small as 2 percent lower than normal can reduce cognitive and physical performance by more than 30 percent. Unfortunately, monitoring and maintaining hydration can be difficult. Methods of analyzing these levels vary between serum ion concentration, urine color, and body mass. Body mass and urine analysis are the more conventional techniques, but lack accuracy due to measurement shortcomings. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a colorimetric dermal patch that measures human hydration by collecting and measuring sweat secretion over small areas of skin. Since most water loss in humans occurs via sweat, this method provides the most accurate analysis of hydration. The device consists of an inexpensive, laser-patterned filter paper sandwiched between two medical grade films, OpSite*. The filter paper contains a water-activated dye that provides an identifiable color change depending on moisture loss from small areas of skin. It is user friendly and easily identifies levels of moisture loss. Advantages:-Accurate-Inexpensive-User friendlyPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Athletics-Cosmetics -Military"
Cold Atmospheric Plasma Device Driven by DC Voltage,"Non-equilibrium atmospheric plasma jets (NEAPJ) are widely used in the fields of sterilization and disinfection without chemical damage to tissue, minimally-invasive surgery, cancer treatment, drug delivery, wound healing, cellular modifications, bioengineering, dermatology, cosmetics, etc. Conventional NEAPJ uses AC voltage or pulsed DC power supplies, which cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) and high ground leakage currents. There is a need for an NEAPJ without such problems.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new device for generating cold plasma jets that uses pure DC voltage as opposed to AC voltage or pulsed DC power devices. Using a pure DC voltage reduces the problems caused by EMI, such as problems with medical monitors and medical devices. When EMI causes such devices to malfunction, it puts the patient at risk.Advantages:-Reduces electromagnetic interference and high ground leakage currents-Does not damage tissuePotential Applications:-Sterilization and disinfection of tissue wounds-Medical applications"
Combination of Cholesterol Esterification Inhibitors with Existing Therapies for Cancer Treatment,"Despite recent advancements in cancer treatment, drug resistance remains a major impediment to developing successful control or cure for cancer. Numerous attempts have been made to decipher the mechanisms underlying cancer resistance, but none have attacked the issue regarding the role cholesterol metabolism plays. Purdue University researchers found an unexpected accumulation of cholesteryl ester in aggressive types of cancer. Their research has shown that applying an effective amount of at least one agent to an existing cancer treatment resensitizes the cancer cells to the existing cancer treatment by inhibiting cholesterol esterification pathways. Advantages:-Targets the metabolic pathway to overcome drug resistance-Works in conjunction with existing therapiesPotential Applications:-Cancer treatment-Drug resistance diseases-Therapeutics"
Therapeutic for Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Cancers,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has a five-year survival rate of 25 percent. Patients develop resistance to the current standard AML drug, ara-C, both alone and in combination with other cancer drugs. In AML as well as a number of other cancers, the disease is driven by protein kinases like FLT-3 and TrkC. Another structure implicated in cancer is the G-quadruplex formed through DNA interactions. This biology can be taken advantage of to design a more effective treatment for AML.A Purdue University researcher has developed a series of new compounds that inhibit the FLT-3 and TrkC protein kinases and bind to G-quadruplexes. These compounds display activity in AML cell lines with nanomolar IC50 values. In addition to their effectiveness against cancer cell lines, these compounds have been designed to be metabolically stable. It is anticipated that these compounds will have superior performance against AML compared to the standard treatment. The mechanisms that drive AML also drive many cancers, so these dual protein kinase inhibitors/G-quadruplex binders have broad potential as cancer therapeutics. Advantages: -Potent anticancer agents -Designed to be metabolically stable Potential Applications: -AML therapeutic-Treatment for multiple cancersRelated Publication:Identification of new FLT3 inhibitors that potently inhibit AML cell lines, via an azo cllick-it/staple-it approach.

Facile Expression and Purification of USP17 for use in Cancer Drug Discovery,"USP17, a ubiquitin specific enzyme, is responsible for the progression of the cell cycle to promote cellular proliferation. In many cancers, including breast and prostate, USP17 levels are upregulated, promoting unregulated proliferation and cancer. Over the last 10 years, cell-based studies have identified USP17 as a potential target for cancer therapy; however, there has been no advancement in the production of recombinant USP17. Availability of large amounts of purified, recombinant USP17 is critical for developing an anticancer therapeutic against this target.Researchers from Purdue University have developed a methodology for the expression and purification of recombinant USP17, which allows for the utilization of a much wider array of techniques compared to cell based assays. Recombinant USP17 can be used for kinetic, structural, biochemical studies, and other studies of the enzyme and its response to drug candidates. The Purdue researchers' protocol and the resulting recombinant protein provide others with the tools to develop therapeutics against cancers in which USP17 regulation is a major component. This method will help advance the development of anticancer therapeutics that target USP17.Advantages:-Recombinant protein now available-Facilitates drug discoveryPotential Applications:-Drug Discovery-Pharmaceutical industry-Biomedical industry-Biomedical and Pharmaceutical R&D-Medical diagnosis"
Injectable Elastic Polymeric System for Tissue Scaffolds,"Medications are drugs used to treat, cure, prevent, or diagnose an illness or medical condition. However, sometimes drugs are not effective by simply being ingested. Delivery of local or systemic drugs requires targeted doses to specific parts of the body. The accuracy of delivery is often hampered by inferior mechanical performance of the material used for delivery.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a functionalized hyaluronic acid (HA), a thermo-responsive elastic polymer system comprising functionalized HA, and the methods of fabrication and utilization for drug delivery. This polymer system is injectable and may be used for spatio-temporally controlled delivery of analgesics, anesthetics, antibodies, and other drugs as well as growth factors. Controlled drug delivery offers numerous advantages when compared to conventional dosage forms including improved efficacy, reduced toxicity, reduced need for specialized drug administration, and improved patient compliance/convenience. In addition, HA offers numerous useful biological benefits including wound healing, cell adhesion and proliferation, cell motility, angiogenesis, cellular signaling, and matrix organization.Advantages:-Injectable-Thermo-responsive-Highly elastic-Controlled drug deliveryPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Drug delivery-Tissue engineering"
Tissue Engineering Composites,"Tissue decelluarization has been shown as a viable means of tissue regeneration in the face of traumatic injury or degenerative diseases. Articular cartilage defects are resilient to natural repair and subject to high mechanical forces, which can lead to further tissue degeneration. Current microparticle systems require hostile exogenous crosslinking, have little control over the final microparticle density, and do not investigate the contribution of separate cartilage components to the chondrogenic induction and maintenance. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an alternative method of treatment that allows for custom molding of implants, increased porosity between particles for global cell delivery, and relatively small cartilage thicknesses for promoted cell infiltration. This technology uses native tissue and molecules, making it ideal in the application of articular cartilage. Unlike other methods that use synthetic polymer systems or native polymers that can lead to long-term degradation of cartilage, this technology provides dense packing of embedding matrix and cells.Advantages:-Eliminates potential for degradation of tissue after surgeryPotential Applications:-Biomaterials-Surgical components-Surgical technology"
Assistive Movement Device Expedites Recovery of Lower Leg Injuries ,"Studies conducted in 2011 show that approximately 864,000 people suffered from fractures requiring the use of crutches. Of those, approximately 319,000 occurred at or below the knee affecting the ankle, foot, tibia, fibula, and/or knee. It is known that the healing process can be made more efficient by gradually restoring load to an injured limb; however, there are no existing products that provide variable loading throughout the healing process. Therefore, there is a need for an assistive movement device that compliments the optimal recovery process below the knee injuries.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an innovative assistive movement device to aid those affected with lower limb impairments. This technology expedites the recovery process using variable weight adjustability on the injured limb. This device allows users to move freely in their everyday activities without the limitations of normal crutches. The total recovery time is further decreased by encouraging a stronger union through axial compressive dynamization of the limb.Advantages: -Reduces recovery time-Encourages a stronger union through axial compressive dynamization-Allows users to be more mobile during recovery periodPotential Applications: -Medical/Health-Orthopedics-Physical therapy-Lower limb injuries"
Novel Aryl Isonitrile Antimicrobials Active Against Clinically Important Bacterial Strains,"Antibiotics and infectious disease therapy made huge strides in the last century; however, the emergence of resistant strains and superbugs has increased. In the United States alone, 2 million people each year are affected by these infections, resulting in over 23,000 fatalities. Out of these, nearly half are caused by the pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and VRSA) cause a range of diseases including superficial skin infections, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and bloodstream infections. These strains have become resistant to nearly every class of antibiotics, including agents of last resort, such as vancomycin and linezolid.Researchers at Purdue University have identified a novel class of compounds that have an aryl isonitrile moiety that shows potent inhibitory activity against clinically important strains of MRSA and VRSA, Bacillus anthracis, and Listeria monocytogenes. These compounds demonstrate strong antimicrobial activity against MRSA strains that are resistant to numerous antibiotic classes such as penicillins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, lincosamides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. Not only are these compounds potent, they do not show any apparent toxicity against mammalian cells up to a concentration of 64 micrometers, compared to other antibiotics that have a narrow therapeutic to toxic concentration range. In addition, analysis implies that cross-resistance between other antibiotics and these aryl isonitrile compounds is unlikely. Hence, these compounds have the potential for use as future alternatives to other antibiotics for the treatment of resistant strains of MRSA and VRSA in clinical settings.  Advantages:-Potent antimicrobial activity-Minimal toxicity at high concentrations-Effective against resistant strainsPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industry-Drug R&D-Alternative antimicrobial therapy-Treatment of antibiotic-resistant strainsRelated Publications:Davis, Dexter C., et al. Discovery and Characterization of Aryl Isonitriles as a New Class of Compounds Versus Methicillin- andVancomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Enhanced Insect Susceptibility to Entomopathogens,"A termite population does not only pose a risk because of the significant structural damage they are capable of inflicting on buildings, crops, and forests, but their subterranean, eusocial lifestyle creates a breeding grounds for disease and microbial growth.  Despite decades of research, no commercially viable biocontrol agent targeted at termites has been developed.  Recent research has suggested termites possess superior defense mechanisms that provide them with virtual immunity against fungal and bacterial pathogens.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology that can identify genes and proteins in termites that increase susceptibility to pathogens.  Whereas much research and development have gone into non-specific chemical insecticides that attempt to brute force their way through the termites' defenses, this new technology aims to dismantle the defense outright.  Using treatments of an immune-suppressive nicotinoid insecticide and fungi and bacterial pathogens, hundreds of genes that encode potential defense mechanisms have been identified; the expression of these genes can be suppressed, increasing the termites' susceptibility to pathogens.  Several protist symbiont enzymes were also identified which may have played a central role in protecting termites from fungal entomopathogens, and a recombinant form of these enzymes may have uses as novel drugs to fight fungal infections.Advantages:-More biorational and environmentally friendly than chemical insecticides-Protein-based enzymatic treatment offers a more ""organic"" approach than conventional drugsPotential Applications:-Termite control-Fungal infection treatmentRelated Publication:Molecular Signatures of Nicotinoid-Pathogen Synergy in the Termite Gut.

Peptoid Cancer Drugs Targeting PCNA Designed via a Novel in Silico/In Vitro Pipeline,"Fragment-based drug discovery is a popular method used to design molecules that bind to protein targets. In this method, many small compounds are screened for their binding to a target protein. Subsequently, steps are undertaken to combine more than one of the small compounds found to bind weakly into a larger, stronger-binding, drug-like compound. Fragment-based drug discovery presents a significant challenge; information must be known about the binding sites of the fragments so that they can be combined in a way that does not disrupt the binding of the individual fragments. In addition, many important drug target proteins participate in protein-protein interactions. Disrupting such interactions is critical to disrupting the chemical signals that drive cancer and other diseases.To overcome the challenges of traditional fragment-based drug design, researchers at Purdue University used a combination of computational and experimental technique to discover novel inhibitors of the interaction between proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and a peptide that binds to a site on PCNA responsible for multiple protein-protein interactions relevant to its cellular function. Specifically, thousands of tripeptoids (peptide-like molecules with three chemically distinct sites) were screened in silico, facilitating the selection of a small number of tripeptoids for in vitro testing. Several of the selected tripeptoids show a good ability to disrupt the PCNA-peptide interaction. This method of drug discovery successfully identified a small number of hit compounds that disrupt a protein-protein interaction involving PCNA, an important cancer target.Advantages: -Potential first-in-class cancer drug-Fewer compounds synthesized -Less structural information needed than in traditional fragment-based drug discovery-Well-suited to targeting protein-protein interactionsPotential Applications: -Drug discovery-Cancer therapy"
"High-Throughput, Quantitative Sensing of Protein Activity Using DNA-Encoded Probes","Molecular biologists and clinicians studying and diagnosing critical biological problems, including human disease and cancer, rely on methods to detect the activity of proteins that are often costly, not amenable to high-throughput detection, limited by their sensitivity, and ineffective for complex samples. A sensitive method to detect protein activity that overcomes these challenges has the potential to speed the pace and improve the quality of countless endeavors in biomedical research and diagnostics.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a platform that detects enzymatic activity in complex samples with high sensitivity that is cost-effective, high-throughput, and easily analyzed with current instrumentation. To accomplish this, a DNA sequence is used to encode a protein sample's activity in response to the presence of a drug or another change in conditions for each sample in a high-throughput assay. This technology has been successfully employed to detect activity of the metabolic protein, protein kinase A, and the proteins important to cancer biology, farnesyltransferase and caspase 3.Advantages: -Low cost-Highly sensitive-High-throughput profiling Potential applications: -Cancer diagnosis and characterization -Basic research -Drug development"
Aromatase Inhibitor Breast Cancer Therapeutics with Reduced Potential for Side Effects,"Aromatase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens, which is a crucial step in the biosynthesis of estrogens in the human body. Hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer cells are stimulated by estrogen; therefore, aromatase inhibitors (AI) have been widely used for treatment of this cancer in postmenopausal women. Despite the efficacy of AIs, these drugs have a variety of side effects including joint pain and susceptibility to bone fracture. More than 10 percent of patients discontinue AI therapy after six months due to musculoskeletal toxicity.To combat these side effects, researchers at Purdue University have developed a compound with dual activity as an aromatase inhibitor and selective estrogen receptor modulator. The compound's activity as a selective estrogen receptor modulator promises a way to avoid the undesired side effects. The compound's display binding to both aromatase and estrogen receptors and modulate estrogen receptor activity in vitro.Advantages: -Fewer potential side effects than current aromatase inhibitors-Modulates estrogen receptors  Potential Applications: -Breast cancer treatmentRelated Publications:Lv, Wei, et al. Synthesis of Triphenylethylene Bisphenols as Aromatase Inhibitors That Also Modulate EstrogenReceptors. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. 2016, 59, pp 157-170.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01677."
Questionnaire to Screen Adverse Patient Drug Reactions and Effects,"Many patients today are prescribed multiple medications to treat various health concerns. As the number of medications available grows, it becomes difficult for the doctor, pharmacist, and patient to know which medications are resulting in adverse drug reactions and effects. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a screening system, Pharmaceutical Therapy Related Quality of Life (PTRQoL) instrument. The PTRQoL system is a set of questionnaires that identify adverse drug reactions and effects associated with the 200 most popular prescription drugs. The PTRQoL system could be used by patients at a computer kiosk while they wait for their prescriptions to be filled. When the pharmacist is counseling the patient, they can utilize the results of the questionnaire to identify and focus on existing issues the patient may be experiencing. The PTRQoL system could also be used for mail-order patients to increase pharmacist/patient interaction.To view a video related to this technology, click this link:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJfv8S6ox0oAdvantages: -Patent is better served-Enhanced pharmacist/patient interaction-Pharmacies will be able to provide better, cost-effective counselingPotential Applications:-Pharmacies-Physicians-Patients"
P188 as a Treatment for Trauma to the Nervous System,"Following mechanical injury to the spinal cord, a large number of sensory and motor nerve fibers are disrupted and subsequently destroyed. The major pathology involved in such nerve loss is related to the breakdown of membranes of nerve cell axons, even to the point of complete severance. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and other copolymers seal nerve membrane defects and breaches caused by direct mechanical damage. Purdue University researchers have developed a technology that uses poloxamer P188 in spinal cord injury repair applications. P188 can be applied topically to exposed nerve fibers or by intravenous or subcutaneous injection. Similar research has been done with a related polymer, PEG; however, there are several advantages with using P188 in spinal cord injury applications. Advantages: -Can be produced in sterile form-Can be administered by intravenous or subcutaneous injection-Gives identical functional recovery to topically applied PEGPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Spinal cord injuries"
A Novel Method for Preparing Fusible Proteoliposomes for Biological Nanopore Sensing Technology,"The biological nanopore sensing technology is a technique that has been experimentally proven to sequence DNA and identify and quantify the targets of molecules with different sizes by means of a nanosized protein pore formed in a planar bilayer membrane at the single-molecule level. However, a huge challenge to this technique is how to realize efficient insertion of a variety of either the channel proteins from cell membrane or phage portal proteins into the bilayer membranes, which represents an extremely technical and tedious task. Especially for the proteins with high hydrophobicity, the proteoliposomes reconstituted with the proteins are always required. Unfortunately, the fusion of the proteoliposomes into the bilayers is often sporadic, unpredictable, and highly variable. Traditional methods, such as the use of high-cost biologically compatible detergents, can partially solve the issues, while they are not appropriate for mass production of the proteoliposomes. Moreover, improvements of the methods are also needed to extend the shelf life of the proteoliposomes for commercial purpose. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new method for the preparation of fusible proteoliposomes containing portal proteins from bacteriophages. To address the aforementioned issues with the proteoliposomes, this method eliminates the need for the high-cost detergents, making the proteins less hydrophobic and saving the time needed for detergent removal. The prepared proteoliposomes are more efficiently and rapidly inserted into the bilayers for nanopore sensing, maintaining an extended shelf life. This method has the potential for use as a practical and universal method for reconstituting the proteoliposomes with other hydrophobic channel proteins from cell membranes. It could be commercialized for different biomedical applications and enhance nanotechnology, biophysics, microbiology, and pharmaceutical research & development. Advantages:-Increased the protein stability in the proteoliposomes-Adjustable and highly efficient fusion of channel proteins into bilayer membranes -Better liposome longevity, easing storage and transport-Universal, simple, and practicalPotential Applications:-Biomedical applications such as nanopore sensing technology and liposome assisted drug-delivery systems-Enhance research areas that use proteoliposomes"
Microorganisms as Radiation Sensors,"Measuring radiation has been an ever-improving science since radiation became an important topic decades ago. While devices can measure radiation in quantitative fashion, measuring radiation dosages in organisms has been a harder case to solve. Current radiation sensing technologies cannot provide biologically relevant information regarding radiation exposure, which prohibits us from learning the level of radiation damage. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method of measuring radiation that correlates with the actual damage caused by radiation to DNA in organisms. By measuring the reaction outputs of microorganisms supplied by sugar, information can be gathered regarding the extent that radiation damaged the DNA of the cells. This method of measuring radiation in organisms can replace outdated film badges and similar sensors while providing better, more biologically relevant information.Advantages:-Simple design and easy to measure-Provides information useful for biological purposes-Correlates with DNA damagePotential Applications:-Radiation exposure treatment-Laboratory experiments"
Automatic Recording of Single Neurons Guided by Computer Vision,"One of the critical questions in neuroscience is how brain neural networks perform computations necessary for higher level cognitive functions.  To answer this question, one needs to record electrical activity of individual neurons with synaptic resolution.  The tool best suited to address this question is the whole-cell patch clamp technique, where multiple aspects of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents, cellular excitability, and interneuronal connectivity can be characterized.  However, this method is slow and requires users with high levels of expertise.Researchers at Purdue University have developed software that allows automatic patch-clamp recordings from individual neurons in a brain slice.  They have also developed a pressure control prototype that together with a micromanipulator, allow the program to control the patch-clamp process.  This technology uses computer vision to make this process completely automatic, requiring no human participation.  Automatic image guidance makes the whole-cell patch clamp technique faster, easier to perform, and accessible for less experienced users.Advantages:-Faster-Easier-Extensive training is not requiredPotential Applications:-Brain neural network research-Pharmaceutical testing"
Programs for Calculation of Electromagnetic Fields in MRI,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used as a noninvasive medical procedure to assist physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions. MRI scanners generate strong magnetic fields, which may pose risks or problems to patients with certain implants or medical devices, such as cochlear implants and many permanent pacemakers. Researchers at Purdue University have developed several programs for the analysis of the interactions between medical implants and the electromagnetic fields generated by MRI machines and others. Written in MATLAB, these programs are capable of calculating the heating of wires by an external magnetic field, calculation of electric currents induced by gradients in the MRIs magnetic field, calculation of magnetic fields induced in a patient by an MRI, and calculation of heating an entire medical implant during an MRI procedure. These programs are as of yet without a user interface; input and output are done with MATLAB. Advantages: -Increased patient safety -Calculates heating, electric currents, and magnetic field strength simultaneously Potential Applications: -Medical/Health-Monitoring interactions between MRI and medical implants"
Portable System for Imaging and Diffractometry,"Large microscopes are used for specimen analysis, restricting use to the laboratory setting. Diffraction measurements require custom built, experimental setups, which usually need a large amount of space and highly trained personnel to operate.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a completely portable package capable of performing bright-field imaging and diffraction-based measurements on samples.  This device includes all optics, electronics, on-board computer, touch-screen, and wireless interface.  Measurements and data analysis can easily occur outside of laboratories because the on-board computer is capable of performing a wide variety of analysis on captured images.Advantages:-Portable-Perform a wide variety of analysis and measurementsPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Medical testing-Research"
Impedance-Based Gas Detector Microchannels,"Fluidic microchannels are found in many biological systems and provide high rates of heat and mass transfer in organs such as the brain, lungs, liver and kidneys. Currently, these microchannels are frequently used for treating certain medical conditions; however, there is critical need to detect and avoid bubbles in the blood to prevent air embolisms during medical applications, a potentially fatal complication.Researchers at Purdue University have developed technology that can detect gas bubbles in microchannels coated with polyethylene oxide (PEO) and dielectric microchannels carrying a conductive fluid. Output signals from the low-cost and fast-responding electrical sensor can be used to monitor the fluid flow in the small-scale channel. This technology could have a significant impact on medical applications such as hemodialysis. Advantages: -Gas void fraction detection applicable at the microscale-Relatively inexpensive to implement -Prevent air embolismsPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Hemodialysis"
Waterproof Protein-Based Adhesives,"Around 230 million invasive surgical procedures are performed every year worldwide and almost all of these procedures introduce additional tissue damage when stitches and staples are used to seal the incision. Designing an effective surgical adhesive that does not cause extra damage and may be applied internally is an important goal in biotechnology research. To be effective, a soft tissue adhesive should be biocompatible, set in a wet environment, create a strong bond, and match the stiffness of the surrounding soft tissues. The surgical glues used most commonly, fibrin-based and cyanoacrylate, are not effective enough to replace stitches and staples. Fibrin-based sealants form weak bonds and cyanoacrylates cause inflammation.Researchers at Purdue University are developing an effective surgical adhesive that shows promise in other applications as well. The glue uses a family of recombinantly produced proteins and an enzymatically modified amino acid to form a strong elastic bond between the soft tissues being joined. The structural control afforded by this genetic engineering approach will allow molecular level alterations to the material's properties for promise in future uses. For example, the challenging process of integrating biologically inert prostheses with native tissue could be improved by adhering growth factor domains on prostheses to promote cell proliferation. This novel material may also be used to prevent migration of cells after chondrocyte implantation in cartilage repair.Advantages:-Matches soft tissue elasticity-Genetic approach allows many possible future usesPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Surgical adhesive to replace stitches and staples-Prostheses-Cartilage repair"
Dihydroquinazoline-Derived Inhibitors for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive mental deterioration, resulting in loss of memory, confusion and disorientation, and other behavioral problems. Unfortunately, no definitive cure has been developed to treat this disease. Beta-secretase, an important enzyme in the development and onset of Alzheimer's disease, contributes to the formation of amyloid-beta peptides that aggregate in the brain of Alzheimer's patients. Blocking beta-secretase is a potential strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Researchers at Purdue University have developed novel compounds that inhibit beta-secretase for Alzheimer's treatment. By focusing on a known dihydroquinazoline scaffold, a series of novel dihydroquinazoline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated. Several compounds in this series were shown to exhibit better beta-secretase cellular inhibitory activity compared to current compounds reported in literature. These compounds show increased potency, improved aqueous solubility, increased metabolic stability, and improved oral bioavailability.Advantages:-Improved beta-secretase cellular inhibition-Increased metabolic stabilityPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical industry"
Peptidomimetic Inhibitors for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive mental deterioration, resulting in loss of memory, confusion and disorientation, and other behavioral problems. Unfortunately, no definitive cure has been developed to treat this disease. Beta-secretase, an important enzyme in the development and onset of Alzheimer's disease, contributes to the formation of amyloid-beta peptides that aggregate in the brain of Alzheimer's patients. Blocking beta-secretase is a potential strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a series of novel compounds for beta-secretase inhibition that offer improved pharmacological properties. Novel peptidomimetic scaffolds were utilized to replace conventional hydroxyethylamine isosteres and were shown to be good inhibitors of beta-secretase. This series of compounds shows increased potency, improved aqueous solubility, increased metabolic stability, and improved oral bioavailability over previously identified inhibitors or beta-secretase.Advantages:-Improved pharmacological properties-Shown to be good inhibitors of beta-secretasePotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical Industry"
"Medication Use Simulation Software for Pharmacy, Nursing, and Medical Students
","At present, there are not many ethical methods to teach medication safety through practice based learning in the classroom environment. Purdue University added medication safety as a core course in 2014, when other universities had yet to fully implement the course. In healthcare facilities, professionals are not encouraged to experiment with safe practices as this can cost patient lives. In addition, no standardized level of training for safe practice is available.To bridge this gap in training, Purdue University professors have developed a tablet-based, mid-fidelity simulation that replicates the medication use process in a hospital environment. This simulator allows students to complete tasks according to their roles in the simulation. The tablets will simulate an electronic health record with real-time updates on medications prescribed and administered, as well as the clinical condition of the simulated patients. The focus of this technology is to track the impact of hospital processes on patient outcomes, especially with adherence of best practices in that setting. Compared to currently available options, the simulator would place the student in a physical environment similar to that of a professional site and includes peer interaction in a safe manner, with continuous tracking of outcomes. Since this is a mid-fidelity technology, it is less expensive to develop and maintain compared to high fidelity programs, but at the same time, it is more detailed and accurate to real world scenarios than low fidelity programs. This technology has potential for use in coursework and training for students in healthcare environments to replicate best medication use practices. It will be an adjunct to regular classroom lecture material.Advantages:-Hands on simulation of hospital environment-Practice for safe medication use-Mid-fidelity technologyPotential Applications:-University coursework and training-Replicate best medication use practices-Continuing education on medication safety for professionals"
SwayWatch: A Smartphone App to Quantify Balance,"According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of sports related traumatic brain injury (TBI) visits to hospital emergency rooms grew to 248,416 children (age 19 or younger) in 2009, an increase of 57 percent compared to 2001. In addition, TBIs were recently linked to costly and life altering medical problems such as Alzheimer's. Many sports leagues have taken an initiative to reduce TBI related risks by implementing new rules, but these guidelines are very subjective and difficult to determine. Therefore, there is a need for low-cost technology that can quickly and accurately determine the severity of head injuries. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an application for smartphones where the camera captures the motion of markers on the feet and/or ground while a person is standing. The motion of the markers is directly correlated to the person's trunk motion, which is used to quantify the body sway. The body sway can be used to quantify changes in balance resulting from a TBI in athletes. In addition, this technology can be used as a biomarker for diseases, such as Alzheimer's and autism. This technology is an effective and economical alternative given it relies solely on a smartphone. Advantages: -Superior accuracy -Simple and economical compared to current solutions -Better quantification of sway Potential Applications: -Capture the motion/sway of a person standing -Biomarker for diseases, such as Alzheimer's and autism -Monitor athletes following a TBI"
Bioresorbable Metals for Orthopedic Applications,"Currently, medical operations that require an orthopedic implant must be followed-up with a second surgery to remove the implant or the accompanying hardware of the implant. The additional surgery results in higher medical costs for patients and increases the risk of complications. However, the use of nontoxic, biodegradable implants could eliminate the need for a second surgery. According to BCC Research (2015), the global market for implantable biomaterials is expected to grow through 2019 at a compounded annual growth rate of 6.7 percent.Researchers at Purdue University have developed technology for a resorbable orthopedic implant that is safely absorbed after providing adequate support for damaged bones. This resorbable metal technology provides superior properties over its counterparts, including high porosity for vascular invasion, control of particulate size and degradation rate, and control of mechanical properties to support fixation. Furthermore, the inclusion of hydroxyapatite particulates helps promote bone cell mineralization.Advantages:-Eliminates the need for a second surgery to remove implant-Superior control over porosity, surface area and roughness, and corrosion rates-Promotes bone recovery with the inclusion of hydroxyapatite particulatesPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Orthopedic injuriesRelated Publications:Michael Heiden, Eric Nauman, Lia Stanciu.

Augmented Reality Tools for Telementoring and Telesurgery,"Problem Addressed:Optimal surgery and trauma treatment requires a multitude of surgical skills that are frequently unavailable in rural hospitals and field locations.  Currently, telementoring is used to provide this missing expertise to such locations; however, these systems require the trainee to focus on a telestrator, fail to illustrate upcoming surgical steps, and give the mentor an incomplete picture of the ongoing surgery. Therefore, there is an unmet need for technology to facilitate these complex telementoring processes. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel approach to surgical telementoring using an augmented reality (AR) simulated transparent display. The system allows a mentor to add annotations to be displayed for a mentee during surgery. The annotations are displayed on a tablet held between the mentee and the surgical site as a heads-up display. As it moves, the system uses computer vision algorithms to track and align the annotations with the surgical region. Among other applications, this system allows trainees to remain focused on the surgical region and reduces the potential for errors during surgery. Advantages: -Utilizes augmented reality to enhance the sense of copresence -Computer vision algorithms track and align the annotations with the surgical region -Allow trainees to remain focused on the surgical region Potential Applications: -Telementoring -Telesurgery -Distance learning"
Colony Imaging and Analysis,"Currently, for the identification of bacterial colonies, techniques have been developed using laser light scatter, which creates patterns or fingerprints that can be classified and used to identify the microorganisms. However, very small colonies are hard to identify and some colonies are not organized in a structured fashion, like bacteria; therefore, there is a need to have enhanced imaging other than just a laser scatter. To solve this issue, researchers at Purdue University have developed a technique that introduces an additional colony image by recording the entire colony image and associating it with a laser scatter pattern, which is later saved in a database where features can be extracted. This method of combining regular images of the entire macroscopic area of interest with the laser scatter fingerprint allows for the evaluation of very small colonies (less than 150 microns) or for cell systems other than microbial colonies. This technology is used in conjunction with current laser scatter techniques, adding only one second per colony to the current method. Different colored light sources can be used to collect reflected or back-scattered light from which additional information can be deduced regarding the colonies. Using the image camera, non-microbial populations, such as stem cells, fibroblast colonies, and other cell colonies, can be segmented and the image processed to identify appropriate or reduced to phenotypically useful groups. Advantages: -Additional images used -Enhanced imaging of colonies -Non-microbial species identifiedPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Diagnostics-Drug development-Clinical trials-Food safety"
"Mechanism for Preventing Bone Density Loss from Sedentary Behavior
","When people lead a sedentary lifestyle by choice or due to age or illness for more than 5 to 10 weeks, they often experience significant bone loss and are at high risk for developing osteoporosis and fracturing a bone. When muscles are not used, the muscles atrophy and a loss of muscle strength occurs. Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, are a common occurrence for those that are bedridden or sedentary. As our population continues to age, more people will experience such effects. One challenge of extended space travel is the long-term effects of microgravity on the human body. Approximately 1.5 percent of bone tissue is lost per month of space travel, leading to an increased risk of bone fractures and osteoporosis when astronauts return to earth. Skeletal muscle is no longer required to maintain posture. Given the aforementioned, the unique subset of muscles used in microgravity leads to rapid overall muscle atrophy. In addition, elevated blood calcium levels from bone loss result in dangerous calcification of soft tissues and potential kidney stone formation. It is unknown whether bones ever truly recover completely. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a device that can provide daily mechanical stimulation to an appendage such as an arm, to prevent the loss of bone density and muscle atrophy in a bedridden environment or in space travel. This device is a comfortable, lightweight sleeve that can be worn every day for 30 minutes to promote bone and muscle health for those that are sedentary, bedridden, or traveling in space. The mechanical stimulation encourages natural blood flow throughout the arm, which is known to stimulate and maintain bone density and muscle tone. This device could be used to prevent bedsores in bedridden patients, fracture healing, osteoporosis prevention, and other ailments related to blood circulation. In addition, it could be used after extended space travel.Advantages: -Prevents loss of bone density and muscle atrophy in bedridden or microgravity situations -Prevents bedsores -Osteoporosis prevention -Increases blood circulationPotential Applications: -Aeronautics Engineering/Manufacturing -Medical/Healthcare"
Diaper-Embedded Transponder for Monitoring Urinary Tract Infection,"Urinary tract infections account for more than 8.1 million visits to physicians' offices per year. If not identified and treated early, urinary tract infections can be a major source of additional disease. To identify urinary tract infections, urine collection and lab urinalysis are two methods currently used; however, there is no existing method that uses a diaper-embedded sensor for patients and infants.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a diaper-embedded transponder for early detection/screening of urinary tract infections. Once activated by urine, the transponder measures and transmits the information via a wireless link to the caregiver. The transponder is autonomous, self-powered, and it provides accurate and timely information.  Advantages: -Diaper embedded-Autonomous and self-powered-Provides accurate and timely informationPotential Applications:-Nursing homes-Hospitals-Nurseries"
Hazardous Material Decontamination Platform,"Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane), has designed, patented, and deployed a Hazardous Materials Decontamination Platform to elevate a responder above possible chemical runoff during decontamination operations. The platform is a portable, re-usable, elevated platform providing a large, non-slip, grated surface on which an individual wearing a fully-encapsulated, hazardous materials suit may stand, and turn, to ensure thorough on-site decontamination. Advantages:- Increased stability and safety- Enhanced durability- Expedited decontamination process- Enhanded portability- Easy to store and deployPotential Applications:- First Responders- Fire Departments- Law Enforcement- Military- Haz-Mat Teams"
Electromagnetic Drug Delivery Using Nanowires,"Targeted drug delivery methods aim to confine the concentration of medication in some body parts relative to others. The goal of such treatments is to target only the diseased tissue maximizing the effectiveness of each dose and reducing negative side effects in other tissues. Cancer treatment is one of the most highly researched areas within targeted drug delivery due to the potential of therapies that target tumors, avoiding the nonspecific side effects of chemotherapy. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an electromagnetic drug delivery system constructed of polypyrrole (PPy) nanowire matting. This material is designed to act as a reservoir for drugs, and is responsive to an externally applied electromagnetic field (EMF) that induces the release of the captured drug into the local environment. Delivery can be turned on or off by using the noninvasive EMF source located remotely from the PPy drug reservoir. The therapeutic agent can be delivered from the inserted or surgically placed PPy mat for many weeks, and the specific region that is targeted can receive very high drug concentrations while systemic regions remain unaffected. Advantages: -Localized drug targeting -Dosage control -Reduction in negative, systemic side effects Potential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical Industry"
Gait Analysis to Predict Falls in Elderly Using a Smartphone Camera,"Falling is a major health issue among older adults (aged 65 and over). According to the CDC, one out of three older adults fall each year, and in 2010, 2.3 million nonfatal fall injuries among older adults were treated in emergency departments. Early identification and prediction of fall risk is likely to help minimize actual falls and the development of secondary problems such as reduced confidence and activity levels. Current methods include accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pressure sensors embedded in shoes; however, these methods are hard to use, not portable, and expensive.In response to the need for a more efficient and effective gait analysis and fall detection system, researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel gait analyzer and fall predictor that can measure stride length, stride time, velocity, and cadence using a camera feature in a smartphone-type device attached to a user. The gait analysis initiates when the user stands and the foot identifiers are recognized by the camera and software. The low cost and high accessibility of the gait analyzer and fall predictor device means that the fall risk can be assessed with an easy to use, unobtrusive solution when compared to existing expensive methods. To view a video related to this technology, click on this link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLXnTx6Rb6AAdvantages: -Multiple measurements - stride length, stride time, velocity, and cadence-Low cost, easy to use, and unobtrusivePotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Senior healthcare-Fall prediction/prevention"
Novel Diabetes Treatment,"Diabetes is a widely prevalent disease that currently affects 25.8 million people in the United States. The predominant form of diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from a combination of reduction in pancreatic beta cell activity and mass, which leads to insufficient insulin production. An enzyme called memapsin 1 is known to be part of the biochemical pathway that leads to the problems with pancreatic beta cells and ultimately causes insulin deficiency. Memapsin 1 deactivates a transmembrane protein shown to increase beta cell proliferation and improve glucose stimulated insulin secretion. The transmembrane protein is deactivated when it undergoes ectodomain cleavage in a process triggered by memapsin 1. Researchers at Purdue University in collaboration with Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation have developed and assayed a series of lead compounds that act as memapsin 1 inhibitors and increase pancreatic beta cell mass. Treatment with these compounds may also be complimented by other therapeutics that increase insulin production, improve glucose homeostasis, or inhibit hyperglucagonemia. Advantages: -Improved glucose homeostasis -Specific enzyme pathway regulationPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals"
SafePace:  Pacemaker Lead Placement System,"Pacemakers are biomedical devices implanted into patients with hearts that have difficulty pumping blood throughout the body. Electrical stimulation from leads in the pacemaker helps the cardiac tissue contract in an effective rhythm. The stability of the pacemaker leads must be assessed to guarantee successful pacemaker implantation, but current methods of testing can leave a wide range of inconclusive results.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new device that will allow surgeons to accurately determine if pacemaker leads have been implanted stably. The device will be fitted mechanically to the pacemaker lead and the surgeon will easily be able to determine if the device disengages from the lead or not. If the device disengages, the implantation has been successful. Otherwise, if the device does not disengage, the implantation is not stable and the pacemaker implantation must be repeated. This device provides a simple method for testing pacemaker lead stability with a clear result.To view a video related to this technology, click on this link:  http://youtu.be/YMSs4vFzf48Advantages:-Simple to use-Clear, accurate answer about pacemaker lead stabilityPotential Applications:-Medical/Health"
Synthesis of Novel Potent Nosocomial Antibiotics,"Hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections cause or contribute to 99,000 deaths each year in the United States alone. A patient's weakened state combined with bacteria's increasing resistance to antibiotics makes these infections difficult to treat. The current suite of antibiotics available for treating serious nosocomial infections, such as MRSA, can have unwanted side effects; hence, it is important to identify new antibiotics.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a class of antibiotic compounds designed to specifically target common nosocomial infections. By selectively targeting the mevalonate pathway of Gram-positive bacteria, these compounds will be more effective with fewer side effects. Several of the analogues also demonstrated selective antibacterial activity against MRSA and VRE, two of the most common and most dangerous nosocomial infections.Advantages:-Targets common nosocomial infections-Fewer side effectsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceutical Industry-Drug Development"
Recovery of Function In Chronic Spinal Cord Injury,"In the United States, there are between 240,000 to 337,000 people chronically injured with severe behavioral loss from spinal cord damage, with approximately 12,500 new cases each year. There is currently no treatment that can recover functions for those affected. Previously, researchers at Purdue University's Center for Paralysis Research have shown 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to be clinically effective in treating chronic spinal cord injury in both dog and man; the compound is now in phase II human clinical tests. Purdue University researchers have developed chemical analogues of 4-AP with superior pharmacological properties compared to the parent compound. Special analogues and cocrystals of the compound 4-AP were synthesized and their biological properties were tested. These compounds and all related derivatives and prodrugs dissolve readily at stomach pH facilitating the distribution of the parent compound and the analogues through the body subsequent to oral intake. These drugs (under stomach pH) have been shown to improve nerve impulse conduction through injured spinal cords in in vitro experimental models. Advantages: -More effective than 4-AP -Long-term stability -Slow dissolution -Facilitates ease of clinical administrationPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals"
Treatment for Demyelinating Diseases and Conditions,"Mechanical damage to the nervous system of mammals sometimes results in irreversible functional deficits. Most functional deficits associated with trauma to both the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) and Central Nervous System (CNS) result from damage to the nerve fiber or axon, blocking the flow of nerve impulse traffic along the nerve fiber. Spinal cord injury is a compression injury to the cord where the injured region of anatomically intact nerve fibers does not function. In particular, this local region (usually less than 1 vertebral segment in extent) does not conduct nerve impulses through the region of damage. 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) has shown promise in restoring nerve function in paralyzed persons; however, clinically meaningful recoveries of function only occur in about 30 percent of the treated population.  For the balance of those receiving treatment, recoveries are associated with numerous unwanted side effects, such as dizziness, loss of balance, and seizure. Researchers at Purdue University have developed analogues of 4-AP, which provide longer lasting effects at a lower concentration with fewer side effects than comparable treatments with 4-AP. The compounds, upon in vivo administration, reduced the effect of traumatic CNS tissue injury by the restoration of nerve impulse conduction through nerve tissue lesions. Advantages: -Analogue of known pharmaceutical -Restores nerve impulse and function in spinal cord injury -Longer lasting than current standard, with lower dose and fewer side effectsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals"
Morphologically Friendly Tissue Imaging,"Imaging mass spectrometry is currently in the translational phase as a tool in medical histopathology and offers a capability of mapping drugs, metabolites, lipids, peptides, and proteins without the need for labeling. Currently, a primary limitation preventing good correlational analysis is the use of chemicals that destroy native tissue structures.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel, morphologically friendly method for DESI-MS tissue imaging. The use of processing chemicals that preserve native tissue structures, instead of destroying them, expands the applications of DESI-MS to tissue imaging. DESI-MS has been used in real time to help surgeons decide how much tissue to take during cancer removal procedures. This new morphologically friendly procedure allows a facile means to distinguish between cancerous and healthy tissues. Advantages:-Native tissue structure preserved	 -Enhanced imaging of complex cancerous tissuesPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Medical imaging"
DNA Modified Nanocomposite Microbiosensors,"Electrochemical biosensors have offered new insights into cellular metabolism. The technology allows scientists to measure the metabolic activity (oxygen, glucose, lactate, etc.) of a single cell or a group of cells. Conventional biosensor materials suffer from low sensitivity and low spatial resolution, but single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) combined with black nanoparticles have been shown to significantly enhance performance. However, it was noted that the carbon nanotubes suffer from aqueous insolubility, limiting the ability to interact with the metabolite of interest.   Purdue University researchers have developed a technology that uses nanocomposites in electrochemical biosensors. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was used to modify SWCNTs to increase solubility in water, making it more useful in physiological applications. The ssDNA-SWCNT nanocomposite exhibits high sensitivity, wide linear range of detection, and low limit detection. This work is significant to biosensor development because this is the first demonstration of ssDNA-SWCNT nanocomposite as a platform for constructing both single-enzyme and multi-enzyme biosensors for physiological applications.Advantages:-Increased sensitivity and spatial resolution-Lowered limit of detectionPotential Applications:-Genetics-Biotechnology"
Detection of Oxidized Proteins for Medical Diagnostics,"Oxidative damage to DNA, RNA, and proteins can seriously threaten the survival of a biological system. High concentrations of radical oxygen species have been implicated in many diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and a variety of inflammatory diseases. Oxidative stress appears to be caused in part by an organism using iron to carry out oxidative processes. Free radicals, ranging from hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, and peroxynitrite to superoxide, occur widely in cells as part of the assimilation and metabolism of nutrients. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a diagnostic method for determining the absence or presence of a disease. This method includes assaying the amount and/or type of oxidized peptides in a sample from a subject and comparing them to the amount and types of reference oxidized peptides. For example, using this technique could identify and quantify changes in oxidized peptides or oxidized proteins associated with diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus or breast cancer. This diagnostic method can also be used to monitor a patient's response to a therapeutic agent, e.g., an antioxidant, and monitor disease recurrence. Using the vital information collected with this method, a tailored treatment plan can be created to better aid a patient's recovery. Advantages: -Proteomic approach to disease monitoring and diagnosis -Protein biomarkers detected at low concentrations -Earlier detection of a large number of diseases -Non-invasive testPotential Applications:-Bioinformatics-Medical/Healthcare"
Body Fluid Component Electrochemical Biosensor ,"There is a growing need for more sensitive instruments for biological sensing. With medical research proving that even minute changes in body fluid can show early warning signs of diseases, such as cancer, biosensors need to be sufficiently sensitive to detect these changes.Purdue University researchers have developed a functioning biosensor technology that incorporates nanotubes to successfully immobilize the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx). This permits the sensing of glucose in a blood sample with greatly improved sensitivity over existing technologies, and there are expectations that this technology could be applied to monitor glucose levels in other body fluids, such as saliva. The general nature of this technology means that it could be readily adapted to sense other important body fluid components. Advantages:-Monitors minute changes in glucose levels -Could be adapted to sense other body fluid componentsPotential Applications:-Medical/Health"

Cp-THF and Tp-THF-Based Novel Protease Inhibitors,"AIDS is an epidemic of global proportion; over 30 million people currently live with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Among many strategies to combat this disease, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with HIV protease inhibitors in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors continues to be the first-line treatment for control of HIV infection. This treatment regimen has definitely improved quality of life, enhanced HIV management, and halted the progression of the disease, and today, more people than ever before are living with HIV/AIDS. However, HIV is quick to develop resistance to new protease inhibitors. As a result, the pharmaceutical industry is continuously searching for new drugs to fight drug-resistant HIV. Darunavir is currently the industry gold standard and has shown the most efficacy in treating drug-resistant HIV strains. Researchers at Purdue University have designed a series of novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors for treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. These compounds have shown enzyme inhibitory activity and antiviral potency on par with Darunavir. Detailed virological studies suggest drug-resistance profiles with the potential to outperform Darunavir, positioning this promising class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors on deck in the fight against drug-resistant HIV.Advantages:-High enzyme inhibitory activity and antiviral potency-Exceptional drug-resistance profilePotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-HIV/AIDS Treatment"
Novel Ligands for HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors,"The AIDS epidemic is one of the most challenging problems in medicine in the 21st century. A retrovirus designated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a complex disease that includes progressive destruction of the immune system and degeneration of the central and peripheral nervous system.Among many strategies to combat this disease, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) continues to be the first-line treatment for control of HIV infection. This treatment regimen has definitely improved quality of life, enhanced HIV management, and halted the progression of the disease. Today, more people than ever before are living with HIV/AIDS thanks to this first-line treatment. However, despite the impressive success, there remain many challenges to treating this devastating disease, including decreasing both the toxicity and complexity of the treatment regimens. In addition, there is a growing population of patients that are developing multidrug-resistant strains of HIV, and there is ample evidence that these strains can be further transmitted. Purdue University researchers have designed and synthesized a novel class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors, which show potency 10x greater than that of Darunavir, an FDA-approved inhibitor developed by the same researchers. A number of these inhibitors are very potent against multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants and could lead to additional drugs used in HIV/AIDS treatment.Advantages: -HIV therapeutic with 10-fold potency increase over current standard-Effective for the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains of HIV Potential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-HIV/AIDS Treatment"
Internalization of Anticancer Cargo by Bladder Tumor Cells,"Bladder cells are well protected and particularly difficult for topically applied therapeutic agents to penetrate.  Constant urine influx and periodic voiding of the bladder further limits the effectiveness of therapy.  Currently, instillation of live Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is most commonly used to increase penetration of therapeutic agents in the treatment of bladder cancer; however, administration of BCG is associated with high local morbidity and the potential for systemic infection.  There is a need for the development of safer, less toxic approaches to administer therapy.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an effective strategy to promote the internalization of anticancer cargo using the fibronectin attachment protein (FAP) from BCG to gain admittance to bladder tumor cells.  FAP binds strongly to targets on the surface of bladder tumor cells; it is subsequently internalized along with the chemotherapeutic cargo.  To combat the transitory nature of bladder contents, an antibody-induced microaggregation strategy is employed that promotes rapid internalization of FAP by bladder tumor cells.  Furthermore, FAP binding on the surface of bladder tumor cells is resistant to the acidic environment of the bladder.  These properties make it an excellent foundation for the design of more effective, less toxic bladder cancer therapies.Advantages:-High-affinity targeting of bladder tumor cells-Rapid internalization-Binding is resistant to the acidic environment of the bladderPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug development-Biotechnology"
Antimicrobial Activity of Substituted Thiazoles Against MRSA,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a global health concern due to its high mortality rate and ability to spread rapidly. For the year 2012, a study by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that 18.74 percent of patients in US healthcare facilities were infected or colonized with MRSA, contributing to an estimated 8,128 deaths from healthcare associated (HCA) infections. In addition, many treatments previously used against MRSA are no longer effective due to the development of microbial resistance to these antibiotics. Consequently, there is currently a dearth of effective treatments for MRSA. Given the severity of MRSA infections, attributed health care costs are estimated between $3 billion and $4 billion per year.Researchers at Purdue University found that a class of chemicals known as thiazoles could be substituted with specific molecular groups to be effective antimicrobials against MRSA and other microorganisms including listeria monocytogenes and bacillus anthracis. These chemicals were shown to inhibit the growth of MRSA cells in broth microdilution trials; furthermore, they were shown to be noncytotoxic to mammalian cells. These two factors mean that this class of substituted thiazoles holds great promise as a future treatment for MRSA infections.Advantages:-Effective at preventing MRSA cell growth-Does not harm mammalian cellsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Medicinal Chemistry-MRSA Treatment"
Improved Speech Recognition for High-Frequency Hearing Loss,"With conventional hearing aid processing, individuals who have severe to profound mid- to high-frequency hearing loss still have great difficulty perceiving important speech information.  Alternative processing strategies that move inaudible high-frequency information to lower frequency regions where hearing loss is less severe have been proposed; however, they all have a common flaw in that they tend to increase confusion between certain sounds, especially 's' and 'z'.  The seriousness of this problem is illustrated by the fact that these sounds constitute about 8 percent of all spoken consonants in the English language.  Purdue University researchers have developed a unique digital signal processing technique that recodes high-frequency speech information in a way that enhances perceptual differences between commonly confused speech sounds.  In preliminary testing, the algorithm has worked better than commercially available alternatives, especially for the consonants 's', 'sh', 'ch', 'j', 't', 'k', and 'z'.  No degradation in vowel recognition has been observed.  The efficacy of using this technology for a broader range of hearing losses, including those with cochlear implants, is currently being tested.Advantages:-Improved identification of consonants-Vowel degradation has not occurred-Preliminary testing shows improvement over current commercial alternativesPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Heath Loss Technology"

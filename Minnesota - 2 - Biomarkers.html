    Despite decades of research, there are currently no effective therapies for tauopathies, a class of neurodegenerative disorders that include Alzheimer’s disease. While recent studies have indicated that tau oligomers are the primary
    toxic species in these diseases, very few clinical compounds that target tau itself are being pursued. To fill this gap, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed biosensors that monitor tau oligomer and monomer
    conformations that can be used as a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform to identify novel compounds that modulate tau and attenuate associated toxicity. These compounds could be used in research to accelerate our understanding of
    tauopathies and how to treat them and/or could be developed as therapeutics.
</p>

<p>
    The technology works through two engineered distinct fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors. The first of these biosensors measures intermolecular interactions between separate tau proteins, allowing a readout of
    oligomerization. The second biosensor uses single-molecule FRET (smFRET), to assess conformational changes within single tau proteins. Combined, the readout from these molecular probes will facilitate identification of compounds that
    inhibit tau oligomerization, and provide immediate insights into mechanism of action. Another major advantage of these biosensors is that they are functional in live cells, allowing screening to be carried out in a biologically relevant
    context and without the need for costly and time consuming purification protocols.

    Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) kinase is one of the most frequently mutated genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Early studies have shown that mutations in FLT3 are correlated with poor long-term prognosis with increased risk for
    relapse. To assess FLT3 activity, Laurie Parker’s lab at the University of Minnesota designed substrates phosphorylated by FLT3 in a manner that is highly efficient and specific. Coupled with fluorescent and/or mass spectrometric
    readouts, these peptides are valuable tools in both drug discovery and diagnostics for FLT3-linked AML.
</p>
,
<p>
    The developed FLT3 artificial substrates (FAS-A) is compatible with living cells and facilitates rapid detection of kinase activity in real time. When compared to alternatives, FAS-A is phosphorylated 200% more effectively than the only
    other FLT3 substrate reported in the literature (FLT3tide). Due to its high selectivity, FAS-A can be used in complex lysates or mixtures and with negligible off-target effects and can be multiplexed with other assays. Finally, the
    phosphorylation of the substrate can be measured using ELISA, mass spectrometry, or through incorporation of terbium binding segments, facilitating a fluorescent readout. This flexibility facilitates the use of the substrate in a wide
    variety of applications including high-throughput and drug discovery methods.

    \nAffinity-based cell separation is a technique in which affinity between a cell-surface biomarker and a complimentary, substrate-bound capture ligand is used to capture specific cells. Affinity-based cell separation offers key

    release trigger approach that is independent of the capture mechanism, thereby making this method versatile and readily adaptable for any cell type. After capturing the cells, large, specific, non-toxic “molecular trigger” compounds are
    immobilized adjacent to the ligand-cell complexes; as the captured trigger compounds adopt an extended conformation, the ligand-biomarker bond is broken, releasing the captured cells. Combined with affinity-based cell capturing, this

    Lysine ubiquitination is an essential posttranslational modification in eukaryotic cells and is involved in a multitude of cellular processes including DNA damage and repair, subcellular localization and protein degradation. Alterations
    in ubiquitination of proteins are linked to many serious diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and immunologic disorders. However, a reliable, specific, and rapid method to analyze lysine ubiquitination does not exist.
    A new technology developed at the University of Minnesota uses a chemical proteomics approach to specifically label ubiquitinated lysine residues in proteins using an isotopically labeled acetylglycylglycyl-NHS tag. This tag
    distinguishes unmodified lysine residues in the protein of interest from ubiquitinated lysine residues, and allows for quantification using mass spectrometry. Data has shown that this approach, termed isotopically balanced
    quantification of ubiquitination (IBAQ-Ub) is reliable, specific and has the potential to be developed into a high-throughput method to measure ubiquitination abundance.
</p>
,
<p>
    Compared to the current methods used to assess protein ubiquitination, IBAQ-Ub does not require the use of site specific antibodies or an extra enrichments step, saving both time and money. Furthermore, this technique does not rely on
    in vitro synthesis of isotopically labeled standards required by other methods (i.e. AQUA), and as such could enable global untargeted discoveries of physiologically relevant changes in protein ubiquitination. With further development,
    IBAQ-Ub could have clinical applications and be used to be used for biomarker studies of patient tissues.

    Cryogenic storage is the predominant method of storing biological samples in healthcare and scientific research. However, a single -80°C freezer uses the same amount of energy as an average US household and is prone to power failure
    that could destroy the samples. This exorbitant cost is prohibitive in resource-limited regions making specimen collection and storage unfeasible. Furthermore, the harsh freeze-thaw processing of samples leads to degradation of numerous
    proteinaceous biomolecules. This preservation technique is also problematic for increasingly prevalent biological drugs that require stabilization. Currently, this class of drugs is often freeze dried, a process that can cause
    aggregation, formulation of insoluble aggregates or crystallization of the drug. The new room temperature stabilization technology provides solutions to both of these problems using a novel matrix of modified polysaccharides that
    stabilize biofluid specimens at non-cryogenic temperatures (4°C to room temperature) in a dried state for long-term storage.
</p>
,
<p>
    University of Minnesota researchers developed a technology that employs an electrospun fibrous matrix of polysaccharides onto which a biofluid specimen or biological drug can be applied, and subsequently dried/vitrified under vacuum.
    This process creates a mixture of polysaccharides and biological materials in a glass solid that entraps and stabilizes macromolecules for long term-storage at non-cryogenic temperatures. In the formulation, for increased biomolecular
    preservation, the end-groups of the polysaccharide sugar dextran was reduced (from an aldehyde to a relatively inert alcohol), forming dextranol and eliminating the creation of protein-dextran conjugates. This method has been shown to
    effectively preserve samples, minimizing sample aggregation often observed during cryopreservation and leading to 90-100% recovery of biomarkers assayed (including those that are refractory to freezing). This technology represents the
    first-ever alternative to cryogenic preservation of a broad range of proteinaceous biomarkers and serum metabolites and facilitates research and medicine in underdeveloped and rural environments.

    Identifying cancer biomarkers may allow early disease detection, monitoring of disease progression and/or therapeutic response, and could one day reduce mortality, improve quality of life and minimize healthcare costs. However, this
    discovery and validation process has been slow to progress, and of the thousands of molecular signatures being evaluated, less than two dozen have been approved by the FDA, due in part to poor stability and less than-optimal biospecimen
    storage conditions. The considerably less stringent storage requirements afforded by this technology will be valuable in keeping samples viable for future research, facilitating the process of biomarker discovery and validation.

    A novel metabolomics method can detect pre-invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells by measuring aerobic glycolysis (conversion of glucose to lactate). The ability of cancer cells to produce lactate through aerobic glycolysis is a
    hallmark of cancer, and increased glucose uptake and elevated aerobic glycolysis are closely correlated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.\n \nPre-invasive or metastatic cancer cells have dramatically increased
    production of 3-13C-lactate produced from 1-13C-glucose, over non-invasive cancer cells. By measuring the rate of aerobic glycolysis, which closely correlates with glucose uptake and lactate production in cancer cells, this technology

    Although increased mammography screenings have detected more ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), it has not reduced breast cancer death from metastatic breast cancer. The majority of the DCIS never becomes metastatic and it is unclear why

    indolent breast tumor or benign breast lump or lesion. This new technology, however, can distinguish pre-invasive cancer from benign breast diseases or indolent breast tumors. This diagnostic test may prevent unnecessary breast
    biopsies. It may also be used to monitor therapeutic response and progression of metastatic cancer, either alone or in conjunction with PET/CT.

    BridGE (Bridging Gene Sets with Epistasis) is an innovative computational method that explicitly searches for disease-specific genetic interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS)
    data. The algorithm searches for larger, non-random structures of SNP-SNP interactions, guided by established sets of genes belonging to characterized pathways or gene modules. The concept was derived from extensive analysis of genetic
    interaction networks in yeast, which showed that genetic interactions tend to cluster between functionally compensatory pathways. If several SNPs interact between genes coding for proteins/pathways with redundant functions, the
    likelihood of obtaining statistical significance by searching for larger clusters of SNP-SNP interactions is much greater than if individual SNP interactions were considered separately. Applying BridGE broadly, significant interactions
    were discovered in Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, hypertension, prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes and breast cancer.

    Detecting genetic interactions is important for fully characterizing heritability of complex diseases within Genome Wide\nAssociation Studies (GWAS). Current methods for detecting such genetic interactions are inaccurate, lacking

    BridGE identifies large, non-random clusters that tend to contain genetic interactions. The technology has the potential to transform interpretation of human genome data and expand the therapeutic target space for complex genetic

    A novel approach generates monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against peptide presented in major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II). The methodology centers on having a soluble peptide:MHC (p:MHC) Class II complex linked to biotin as the B
    cell antigenic target. The approach uses recombinant peptide:MHC monomers as immunogens and subsequently relies on multimers to enrich the responding antigen specific B cells prior to fusion and screening. It first immunizes a subject
    with a composition comprising an antigen, isolates a population of cells from the subject and enriches a subpopulation of those cells, and then forms a hybridoma using a cell from the subpopulation. This technology sets the standard for

    The FDA places guidance limits on heating and specific absorption rate (SAR) in humans during magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI), but there is currently no way to measure SAR locally. Generic numerical SAR models, which are not

    permittivity of biological tissues in vivo using a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. This technology is a novel gradient-based EPT approach with greatly improved tissue boundary reconstruction and largely elevated robustness against
    measurement noise compared to existing techniques. It also features a novel EPT G-algorithm that generates SAR maps, based on conductivity and permittivity, with potentially sufficient fidelity to accurately measure local SAR.

    An algorithm using particle swarm optimization (PSO) in programming electrodes in deep brain stimulation arrays (DBSAs) provides clinicians with an intuitive, semi-automated approach for programming multi-electrode neuromodulation
    systems. The system and methods optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy by producing a range of optimal electrode configuration solutions that can achieve a number of objectives, such as maximizing neural activation of a region of
    interest, minimizing activation in a region where stimulation is not desired, minimizing battery power consumption, and maximizing the closeness to sources of sensed functional data. The computed solutions are presented visually to
    clinicians via Pareto front visualization, enabling them to intuitively select a stimulation setting that matches desired activation outcomes and programming goals for each specific patient.

    One of the biggest clinical challenges associated with multiple-electrode DBS leads is the countless possible combinations of\nelectrode configurations as well as inefficient and time-consuming trial-and-error methods entailed in

    identify electrode configurations and stimulation settings optimized for a variety of objectives. By identifying a range of optimal settings, the clinician has a starting point with which to increase or decrease the overall amount of
    current delivered to the patient. This new approach is particularly robust when axonal activation could reasonably occur along multiple points along a given axon and is robust to variation of maximum electrode currents on each site.

    A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence, which allows for complete blood suppression during quantitative imaging, can improve the robustness of quantitative myocardial tissue characterization. The technique, which can be used in
    commercially available MRI scanners with no additional hardware, improves diagnostic capabilities by suppressing blood signals from quantitative maps. The technique helps reduce partial voluming effects at the myocardium-blood interface
    and enables robust quantification of myocardial tissue characteristics—independent of myocardial thickness or slice orientation. The sequence may be used for quantitative assessment of the endocardial myocardium, a typical scar area in
    left ventricular hypertrophy. Eliminating\npartial voluming further reduces false positives in patients with reduced myocardial wall thickness or young healthy subjects, who commonly have thin myocardial walls.

    Quantitative myocardial tissue characterization is a newer yet crucial technology in cardiac MRI. It provides quantitative insights in myocardial tissue composition in numerous cardiac diseases. The technique provides greater diagnostic

    partial voluming effects, and this corruption requires careful expert evaluation of the maps to read the results. In addition, partial-voluming effects restricts the tool’s applicability to the mid-myocardium and reduces its

    While DNA sequencing of stool microbiomes has previously detected colon cancer in a non-invasive manner, this method is unique in that it can detect or predict specific types of mutations without having to sequence the exome or genome
    of tumor cells. Using only the taxonomic profile of the microbial community from the tumor microenvironment, this method can predict whether certain types of mutations are present in a particular tumor’s genome, insight which may lead
    to increased efficacy of treatment.

    A new, versatile reagent can make dual, simultaneous site-specific protein modifications in one reaction and a wide range of\nconjugates, including protein-protein, protein-nucleotide, protein polymers, and protein-small molecule
    couplings. The reagent uses the enzyme PFTase, which is small, specific, and fast acting. The reagent is non-toxic and allows nearby biological processes to continue undisrupted.
</p>
,
<p>
    This reagent has several distinct advantages over similar protein modification methods. Most current methods for site-specific protein modifications only allow one modification at a time. Many methods utilize copper, which can be toxic
    to surrounding biological processes. Current protein tagging methods often use organic solvents and cytotoxic catalysts that are expensive, difficult to obtain, and result in uncontrolled modification at nonspecific sites.
</p>

    Systemic administration of D-serine has been shown to alter blood sugar levels in mice. An acute, high-dose injection of D-serine or a genetic mutation leading to endogenously elevated levels of D-serine resulted in hypoglycemia
    compared to controls in mice. Human islets secreted more insulin in response to glucose when exposed to D-serine under target activating conditions. Prolonged high-concentration exposure to D-serine led to reversible hyperglycemia in
    mice and a loss of islet viability. These results implicate D-serine in the mechanisms of blood sugar regulation and in the symptoms/etiology of progressive forms of diabetes.

<p>
    NMDA receptors are widely expressed in the brain as well as in some peripheral tissues, including the pancreas. To be activated, NMDA receptors need an agonist, like glutamate, and a co-agonist. D-serine is the strongest natural
    co-agonist activator of NMDA receptors currently identified by scientists. Because insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas contain NMDA receptors, it is expected that D-serine treatments can be used to manipulate these pancreatic
    cells in order to change insulin release and blood sugar levels.
</p>

<p>
    D-serine treatments could be used to control type II diabetes. A patient could take a D-serine pill before meals to improve glucose tolerance or with another diabetic therapy to improve hyperglycemic control and/or to minimize the dose
    or frequency of insulin injections. Genetic mutations to D-serine regulatory genes or to D-serine’s co-agonist NMDA receptor target site could be used to identify individuals with diabetic susceptibility and to predict diabetic subtypes

    A pharmaceutical compound consisting of stable glutathione (GSH) analogs has been developed to treat Alzheimer\'s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. The GSH analogs fulfill key roles of endogenous GSH and resist enzyme
    breakdown while acting as a substrate for the detoxifying enzyme glyoxalase-I.
</p>
,
<p>
    The GSH analogs treat AD through two mechanisms. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, a hallmark of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, are caused by Aβ protein aggregation. Aβ aggregation is induced through glycation. Glyoxalase-I curbs
    glycation; but this process is dependent on GSH, which is severely depleted in an AD-affected brain. The new GSH analogs treat AD progression by restoring glyoxalase-I activity in the brain, which decreases glycation, and hampers
    glycation-induced Aβ aggregation, and in turn, plaque formation.
</p>
,
<p>The GSH analogs are able to pass through the blood-brain barrier to neutralize oxidative stress in the brain. Oxidative stress is a root cause of neurodegenerative disorders, as well as other diseases.</p>
,
<p>
    The new GSH analogs are the first compounds to replicate endogenous GSH activity while resisting breakdown. Other compounds which have tried to mimic the role of GSH failed because they were not resistant to breakdown. This treatment
    could be used in conjunction with other AD treatments, or used independently. This AD treatment can be used earlier than any other existing treatments.
</p>
,
<p>
    Separately, the GSH analogs were found to have hepatoprotective qualities. The analogs react directly with N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), a toxic by-product produced during acetaminophen metabolism. Using the GSH analogs in
    combination with acetaminophen could improve overall safety. The analogs could also act as a rescue treatment for acute acetaminophen overdose.

    Turkeys are unique in that their eyes seem to play a role in their reproductive cycle. The eyes appear to have an inhibitory effect on the gonads and respond to different wavelengths and intensity of light. These inhibitory effects seem
    to be the most sensitive to the green-yellow part of the spectrum (520-575 nm) and are most stimulated by the opposite portion of the spectrum, the red (630 nm) wavelength.
</p>
,
<p>
    This technology utilizes the effects of light wavelength on the eyes in order to enhance the reproductive efficiency of poultry. Reproductive performance is enhanced by controlling the type of light to which poultry is exposed;
    preferably increasing red bands while minimizing green-yellow bands for multiple, predetermined lengths of time.
</p>
,
<p>
    Myostatin (GDF-8) is a member of the growth factor family, which plays an important role in regulating development and growth. Myostatin is expressed in the skeletal muscles and seems to act as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle
    growth. This technology works to reduce the inhibitory effects of myostatin on skeletal muscle development in order to stimulate growth rates in turkey hens. The turkeys are given an active immunization against myostatin which causes
    them to produce antibodies that will be transferred to poults through the eggs and induce a passive immunization response in the offspring.
</p>
,
<p>
    The advantage of this technology is that there is no need for drug administration to animals directly or use of a transgenic animal to interfere with myostatin’s inhibitory effects on skeletal muscle growth. This technology also
    provides a safer method to increase turkey growth rate of muscle mass with fewer side effects and without an increase in fat content.

    The Sarcoma miRNA Expression Database (S-MED) provides comprehensive information about microRNA expression patterns in sarcomas and other relevant cancer tissue types, helping the diagnosis, classification, prognosis, and treatment of
    malignant tumors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small RNAs regulating expressed genes in human sarcomas, can assist in the development of cancer treatments. However, miRNA expression patterns in sarcomas are poorly understood and no
    central information resource exists. The Sarcoma miRNA Expression Database addresses this gap by systematically providing comprehensive sarcoma miRNA expression profiles. The database is the first of its kind and not available anywhere
    else in the world. The database is web-accessible and provides both basic and advanced search options.
</p>
,
<p>
    The Sarcoma miRNA Expression Database contains the miRNA expression patterns for 310 tissue samples representing 22 sarcoma types. The database replaces frozen tumor tissue samples, the availability of which is a major challenge in
    studying sarcoma miRNA or gene expression patterns. The database also includes experimentally validated unique miRNA expression levels in angiosarcoma and other uncommon sarcomas. In addition, the database includes miRNA expression data
    from normal tissues such as bone, smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle, and from benign tumors such as neurofibroma and leiomyoma for comparative studies with their malignant counterparts. To make the information easy to understand, the
    database uses heat maps to visualize information and color codes to represent data in absolute and relative formats. Each miRNA is linked to the database so that users can easily track its basic information. Statistical details are
    provided, such as fold changes and P-values for differentially expressed miRNAs in each sarcoma type and corresponding normal tissues.
</p>
,
<p>
    DNA microarray studies have identified differentially expressed genes in various sarcomas. Many of these genes are regulated by miRNAs. MiRNAs are non-coding regulatory small RNAs that display tissue and stage specific expression. By
    accelerating the understanding and identification of miRNAs in sarcomas, the Sarcoma miRNA Expression Database facilitates the development of miRNA-based cancer biomarkers for different sarcoma subtypes. These miRNAs can also be used to
    differentiate the stages of the tumors (i.e., primary or metastatic) and the origin of the metastatic tumors. The database facilitates the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of different types of sarcomas, for which very few diagnostic
    markers currently exist.

    Arrhythmic cardiomyopathy can cause severe problems including cardiac arrest and death. Unfortunately, many of the therapeutics to treat arrhythmias can actually have pro-arrhythmic side effects. This technology is an antagomir
    targeting miR-448 (anti-miR-448), a microRNA linked to the downregulation of the sodium channel SCN5A. Relieving the inhibition of miR-448 facilitates the upregulation of SCN5A, which is protective against arrhythmia, while bypassing
    the potential pro-arhythmic side-effects of existing therapies.

    Despite decades of research, there are currently no effective therapies for tauopathies, a class of neurodegenerative disorders that include Alzheimer’s disease. While recent studies have indicated that tau oligomers are the primary
    toxic species in these diseases, very few clinical compounds that target tau itself are being pursued. To fill this gap, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed biosensors that monitor tau oligomer and monomer
    conformations that can be used as a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform to identify novel compounds that modulate tau and attenuate associated toxicity. These compounds could be used in research to accelerate our understanding of
    tauopathies and how to treat them and/or could be developed as therapeutics.
</p>
,
<p>
    The technology works through two engineered distinct fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors. The first of these biosensors measures intermolecular interactions between separate tau proteins, allowing a readout of
    oligomerization. The second biosensor uses single-molecule FRET (smFRET), to assess conformational changes within single tau proteins. Combined, the readout from these molecular probes will facilitate identification of compounds that
    inhibit tau oligomerization, and provide immediate insights into mechanism of action. Another major advantage of these biosensors is that they are functional in live cells, allowing screening to be carried out in a biologically relevant
    context and without the need for costly and time consuming purification protocols.

    Cancerous cells exhibit alterations to their metabolism that may contribute to proliferation, survival and the development of drug resistance to commonly prescribed cancer treatments. Unfortunately the mechanisms of these metabolic
    changes aren’t well understood, limiting progress on cancer drug therapies. Laurie Parker’s lab at the University of Minnesota developed four artificial, cell-permeable kinase substrates that serve as biosensors for serine/threonine
    kinases (LKB1, AMPK, mTOR and Akt) that are intimately involved in metabolism regulation. The ability to determine the activity of these critical kinases in normal, cancerous and drug-resistant cancer cells will help determine the
    metabolic activities of cells, how resistance develops, and provide molecular targets for therapeutic development.

<p>
    The kinase-specific biosensors have the potential to be combined with assayable fluorophores or other signal moieties, or the phosphorylation of the peptidesalone can be measured using alternate methods such as mass spectrometry.
    Substrates can further be selected based on their ability to permeate the membrane and their compatibility with live cells, The capability of the sensors to provide real-time signaling facilitates the potential to simultaneously monitor
    distinct kinase activities in native cellular environments. The sensors are antibody independent, can be optimized for high-throughput screening methods and (unlike other approaches to monitoring kinase activity) do not need to be
    genetically encoded, making them ideal for development in diagnostic applications.

    Currently, there is no clinically approved drug to specifically treat the SARS-CoV-2 viral infections, and owing to the catastrophic nature of the pandemic there is a race to find a viable treatment. Unfortunately, many traditional drug
    types have limitations that slow the speed at which they can be identified and developed. Small molecule drugs often suffer from relatively low specificity (resulting in side effects). Conversely, traditional antibody drugs often have
    poor pharmacokinetics, are unstable and are expensive to produce. As an alternative route to avoid these limitations, Dr. Fang Li’s lab and Dr. Aaron LeBeau’s lab at the University of Minnesota have developed a series of camelid
    nanobodies (“Nanosota-1”) that are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
</p>
,
<p>
    Nanobodies are single domain antibodies produced by camels and llamas that are much smaller than traditional antibodies, but still bind with high affinity and specificity. Representative nanobodies in the Nanosota series have been
    experimentally shown to bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with high affinity, block binding of the protein to the human ACE2 receptor, and inhibit entry into mammalian cells. Owing to their optimal therapeutic and physical properties, these
    camelid nanobodies have high potential for development into a novel COVID-19 treatment. Development is ongoing and animal trials are underway. Preliminary results have shown that one representative nanobody protected hamsters from
    SARS-CoV-2 infections both prophylactically and therapeutically.

    Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and with solid tumors occurring most commonly (e.g. lung, breast, prostate and colorectal cancers). Due to high variability of the cancers and patients, treatments are often complex and not
    uniformly effective. As an alternative to treatment, researchers at the University of Minnesota developed an approach to prevent cancer through inhibiting the transcription factor STAT3, which is activated in a high percentage of solid
    tumors. STAT3 blockers could be introduced to individuals predisposed to cancer (due to family history, previous occurence of cancer, genetic conditions, etc), or those that are exposed to carcinogenic factors (asbestos, tobacco smoke,
    chemotherapeutics, radiation, etc).
</p>
,
<p>
    Although STAT3 has been implicated in cancer incidence for some time, attempts to use STAT3 blockers to treat existing cancer have unfortunately been unsuccessful. The lab of Dr.Jill Siegfried found that preventative administration of a
    STAT3 blocker following tobacco carcinogen exposure, reduced the occurrence of lung carcinomas by over 80% in a mouse model of disease. While many STAT3 blockers tested have shown low biological activity in patients and high toxicity,
    Siegfried narrowed in on an oligonucleotide based molecule that shows no detectable toxicity after repeat dosing in mice (even when immunocompromised), is highly active, and prevents lung cancer formation at relatively low doses.
    Expanding on these findings has the potential to yield a chemopreventive agent for patients at elevated risk for development of STAT3 associated cancers.

    Topoisomerase II (topo II or Top2) poisons, are a major class of drugs widely used to treat cancers including testicular cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma and ovarian cancer. These drugs work by generating DNA
    damage. However, drug resistance can limit the efficacy of treatment. Human tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase II (TDP2) counteracts the effect of Top2 poisons thus repairing the damaged DNA and leading to chemotherapeutic resistance. To
    mitigate this form of cancer drug-resistance, Dr .Zhengqiang Wang (University of Minnesota) and Dr. Yves Pommier (National Cancer Institute) developed novel phenoxyphenyldeazaflavin compounds that effectively inhibit TDP2 in cancer cell
    lines. Through the inhibition of DNA damage repair machinery, these compounds functionally sensitize cancer cells toward widely-used anticancer Top2 poisons.
</p>
,
<p>
    While previous deazaflavin compounds inhibit TDP2 in biochemical assays, they have not shown strong efficacy in cancer cells. This new technology, which modifies the critical structure of the deazaflavin core, generates the first-ever
    compounds that demonstrate strong efficacy in cancer cell lines. Using these new compounds in conjunction with Top2 poisons cancer therapies inhibits TDP2, keeping Top2 poisons effective and preventing resistance.
</p>
,
<p>
    At concentrations as low as 3 nM, one of the deazaflavin analogs substantially increased the intracellular concentration of Top2 poisons, likely by inhibiting transporter-mediated efflux. This modality will allow the technology to be
    used much more broadly in combination with cancer drugs which suffer from poor efficacy due to efflux.

    Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) kinase is one of the most frequently mutated genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Early studies have shown that mutations in FLT3 are correlated with poor long-term prognosis with increased risk for
    relapse. To assess FLT3 activity, Laurie Parker’s lab at the University of Minnesota designed substrates phosphorylated by FLT3 in a manner that is highly efficient and specific. Coupled with fluorescent and/or mass spectrometric
    readouts, these peptides are valuable tools in both drug discovery and diagnostics for FLT3-linked AML.
</p>

<p>
    The developed FLT3 artificial substrates (FAS-A) is compatible with living cells and facilitates rapid detection of kinase activity in real time. When compared to alternatives, FAS-A is phosphorylated 200% more effectively than the only
    other FLT3 substrate reported in the literature (FLT3tide). Due to its high selectivity, FAS-A can be used in complex lysates or mixtures and with negligible off-target effects and can be multiplexed with other assays. Finally, the
    phosphorylation of the substrate can be measured using ELISA, mass spectrometry, or through incorporation of terbium binding segments, facilitating a fluorescent readout. This flexibility facilitates the use of the substrate in a wide
    variety of applications including high-throughput and drug discovery methods.

    Due to their universal presence in cells, the ability to measure and compare the activity of kinases is critical for basic research and to develop drugs and diagnostics for a myriad of diseases. However, the variability in activity
    between different kinases or between batches of the same kinases has hampered the development of robust control/normalization techniques. Dr. Laurie Parker’s lab used their previously developed KINATEST-ID platform to design and
    optimize a non-selective “universal” substrate for tyrosine kinases that can serve as a normalizer for any kinase of interest. This fully characterized standardizing compound allows for more accurate comparisons of activities from
    reaction to reaction for other substrates or inhibitors.
</p>
,
<p>
    Currently the only identified universal tyrosine kinase substrate is the polyGlueTyr polymer, which is a relatively poor substrate with slow rates of phosphorylation. The newly developed substrate is efficiently phosphorylated by all
    tyrosine kinases tested and compatible with high-throughput screening methods. The substrate can be used as a “standardizer” for intrinsic activity, for quality control, and for normalization of kinase enzyme preparations in comparative
    experiments. Since the method does not require kinase modification or tagging of kinases, it can further serve as a real time baseline of total tyrosine kinase activity in living cells. When combined with biosensors for specific
    tyrosine kinases of interest, the approach facilitates monitoring specific kinase activities in their novel cellular environment over time. This technique can be applied to diagnostics and drug discovery methods that require monitoring
    of pharmacodynamics.

    G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a prominent pharmacological target for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases and disorders. Exemplifying the success of this approach, more than 30% of FDA approved drugs target at least one
    GPCR and worldwide more than 25% of drug sales come from GPCR modulating compounds. However, with more than 800 different types of human GPCRs (that function in a cell-type and tissue dependent manner), a straightforward method to
    measure the efficacy of ligands on specific GPCRs is not currently available. A new technology developed at the University of Minnesota introduces a precise method to measure the intrinsic efficacy of GPCR ligands. This approach employs
    systematic protein affinity strength modulation (SPASM), a modular assay to analyze the interaction between two peptides using fluorescence energy transfer (FRET).
</p>
,
<p>
    Current methods of measuring GPCR ligand efficacy using live cells or crude preparations are complicated by the heterogeneity inherent in different cell or membrane batches. In addition, assays that utilize purified GPCRs require time
    and resource intensive optimization for each GPCR. The new approach from the lab of Dr.Sivaraj Sivaramakrishnan uses a FRET-based biosensor that detects the ligand-induced interaction between a GPR and the Gα subunit of a G protein in
    live cells. This biosensor is paired with giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs), which provides a stable, relevant environment for the GPCR studies without the complexity of the intracellular environment. Not only does this method
    allow for adaptability between different GPCRs, but is also scalable for high-throughput drug screening and analysis, making research on these drug targets easier to advance.

    Cancer cells are resilient because they rewire their metabolism to promote cell proliferation, survival, tumour growth and long‐term maintenance. Solid tumors exhibit metabolic plasticity that allows them to produce energy from either
    glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation, or both. This necessitates that effective therapies must target and inhibit both pathways. There is abundant interest in developing small molecules that selectively target these two aberrant
    metabolic pathways. The search for dual-activity molecules has been impaired by the toxicity of many agents targeting mitochondrial function resulting in a therapeutic window that is too restrictive. To overcome these challenges,
    researchers at the University of Minnesota designed a molecule, F-MD-1 and its derivatives, that exhibits potency in inhibiting glycolysis and mitochondrial function with a large therapeutic window.
</p>
,
<p>
    F-MD-1 works through inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1/4) and the mitochondrial pyruvate carriers (MPC1/2) involved in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. This dual inhibition mechanism is necessary for the
    elimination of cancer as opposed to only tumor reduction. The chemical structure includes a lipophilic cyanocinnamate template designed to create a potent, but reversible, inhibition mechanism. This reversibility makes the molecule
    generally well tolerated when administered systemically, a drastic improvement on the current toxic compounds that target mitochondrial function. Using various cancer cell lines, F-MD-1 effectively inhibits mitochondrial function and
    ATP production as well as the glycolytic capacity of cells. The compound also exhibits improved kinetics and stability compared to its predecessors. These properties lend F-MN-D1 to development as a new anticancer agent that targets
    tumor metabolic plasticity that is common in many solid tumors.\n\n\n

    While there are many pathways in the body that control appetite and weight, the final step is controlled by two receptors in the brain, melanocortin receptors 3 and 4 (MC3R and MC4R). Previous work research failed to identify agonists
    for MC3R, so much effort has been put into anti-obesity compounds targeting MC4R. Unfortunately, these molecules have resulted in increased blood pressure in humans. Dr. Haskell-Luevano at the University of Minnesota has developed the

    Using an uncommon (but powerful) screening approach, Dr. Haskell-Luevano identified compounds in a brand new chemical space for melanocortin agonists. As the first compounds ever reported to selectively activate MC3R, these cyclized,
    penta-peptides represent promising anti-obesity therapeutics. Furthermore, their antagonistic activity against MC4R, minimizes the risk of high blood pressure observed with previous melanocortin receptor-targeting drugs. Additionally,

    Cell transplantation is a promising therapeutic technique for the treatment of end-stage liver disease, acute liver failure and some liver-based metabolic disorders. However, there remains a need for an on-demand supply of large numbers

    The AGC kinase superfamily contains 60 family members that are involved in a variety of biological functions. Some well-known family members are cAMP-dependent protein kinase 1 (PKA) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKC). Many AGC
    kinases are involved in diseases such as cancer and diabetes, making these proteins a tempting target for therapeutics. However, due to the large structural conservation between AGC kinases, it is difficult to design inhibitors that are
    specific to one kinase without affecting multiple family members. In an effort to overcome this challenge, researchers at the University of Minnesota developed a novel platform for the identification of allosteric small-molecule
    substrate-kinase inhibitors.
</p>
,
<p>
    This technology utilizes a small, protein-based sensor that detects specific interactions between AGC kinases and specific substrates. A kinase and a substrate of interest are connected through a protein linker flanked by a FRET donor
    and a FRET acceptor. Through the fluorophores, the sensor reports interaction strength between the AGC kinase and the substrate of interest. Requiring very little protein reagent, this technology is the first assay with the ability to
    detect allosteric changes in substrate-kinase interaction. With a convertible format, a small amount of reagents, and the ability to detect small changes in kinases and substrate interactions, this technology will provide a useful
    platform in the development of kinase-based therapeutics.

    Traditional opiate-based pain therapeutics are linked to opioid use disorders, thus necessitating the development of novel, non-additive alternatives. One potential target for such new compounds is the human Histidine Triad Nucleotide
    Binding Protein 1 (hHint1). hHint1 is involved in the regulation of a broad range of CNS functions including opioid signaling, tolerance, neuropathic pain, and nicotine dependence. These roles, along with its widespread expression in
    the brain, have led hHint1 to be of high interest for research and therapeutic targeting. Given hHINT1’s role in modulating tolerance to opioids, it is a viable non-opioid receptor target for the next generation of pain medications.
    Researchers at the University of Minnesota rationally designed and synthesized hHint inhibitors that bind the protein with submicromolar affinities. These unique small-molecules could be used to further determine the role of Hint1 in
    the CNS or developed into therapeutics for indications for which there are limited options.
</p>
,
<p>
    Previous work using the hHint inhibitor Tryptamine Guanosine carbamate (TrpGc) has shown that hHint1 inhibition is a successful strategy to enhance the pain relieving effects of morphine while preventing tolerance. However, TrpGc
    exhibits low solubility which limits the applications it can be used in. The newly developed inhibitors are nucleoside analogs containing acyl-sulfamate or acyl-sulfimide that show increased solubility as well as binding to hHint1, up
    to 16 times higher affinity than TrpGc. These favorable properties facilitate the use of these compounds in a variety of applications and formulations as well as in the treatment of indications ranging from neuropathic pain and drug
    dependence.

<p>
    Tosedostat, an anti-cancer drug also known as CHR-2797, shows promise as a potential analgesic. The compound has significant analgesic activity and is synergistic with morphine in mouse models. Tosedostat is an aminopeptidase inhibitor
    that blocks the inactivation of endogenous opioid peptides (enkephalins) by aminopeptidases (enkephalinases). This inhibition allows enkephalins to remain in the body longer than they normally would, providing extended analgesic effect
    by binding to μ and δ opioid receptors in the periphery. This method of use is unlikely to overstimulate pain related receptors, thus reducing risk of tolerance, dependency or addiction. Tosedostat as an analgesic could work in
    combination with—or even replace—current analgesic compounds.
</p>
,
<p>
    Prescription painkillers like morphine and other opioids have high abuse potential and often lead to dependency, addiction and increased tolerance. In addition, they can induce severe adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting,
    constipation, respiratory depression and sedation. Alternatives to opioids, like steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), face other drawbacks. These drugs can induce serious side effects such as ulcers, bleeding
    and kidney and liver toxicity. Using Tosedostat as an analgesic allows the body’s natural opioid peptides (enkephalins) to exert an analgesic effect. Because the analgesic effect is restricted to the periphery (i.e., the compound works
    outside the brain), risk of dependence, addiction, increased tolerance or respiratory depression could be reduced or even eliminated. Repurposing Tosedostat for analgesia may provide a pain relief alternative with reduced adverse
    effects. And because Tosedostat has undergone human clinical trials for anticancer activity, its toxicity and side effects are already being evaluated and studied extensively.

    Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins have been repeatedly implicated in inflammation, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, making them enticing targets for the development of potential therapeutics. However, it has been
    challenging to develop inhibitors selective enough to pass clinical trials due to dose limiting toxic side effects. Researchers at the University of Minnesota carried out detailed structure-activity relationship studies resulting in the
    development of compounds that specifically inhibit BRD4-BD1, and avoid off-target interactions with other proteins (including bromodomain-containing proteins).
</p>
,
<p>
    BET proteins function as “readers” of epigenetic modifications on the genome modulating transcription and regulating cellular processes including cell proliferation and cell differentiation. For example the BET protein BRD4 interacts
    with super-enhancer regions, regulating c-Myc expression, a protein that is implicated in as many as 50% of all cancers. A previously identified BET inhibitor also inhibited other bromodomain containing proteins and p38ɑ kinase. Based
    off of crystal structures of inhibitors bound to the kinase or BRD4, researchers modified the compound to enhance BET activity while reducing kinase activity &gt;90,000 fold. Further modifications increased cell permeability of the
    molecule. Therapeutic potential of the compound was demonstrated through verifying activity against cancer cells (MM.1S cells), which was further supported by reduced c-Myc expression.

    Opioids like morphine have been used extensively for the treatment of chronic pain, including pain that is the result of diseases like cancer, AIDS and sickle cell disease. The analgesic effect from activation of the mu opioid receptor
    (MOR) is unfortunately accompanied by undesirable side-effects including tolerance and dependence. Furthermore, the administration of morphine and other opioids has been shown to actually enhance HIV infection in patients. To overcome
    these limitations, researchers at the University of Minnesota developed a two-part molecule, MCC22, that activates MOR to deliver analgesic effects while antagonizing CCR5 to suppress opioid-induced side effects.

    Although mu opioids reduce pain, chronic use promotes increased pain sensitivity through the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines, including CCL5. This chemokine binds CCR5 (which colocalizes with MOR in glia and neurons) and the
    CCL5/CCR5 complex plays a major role in neuroinflammation. CCR5 is also the main co-receptors utilized by HIV-1 viruses to enter cells and accelerate AIDS progression. Through activating MOR and blocking CCR5, MCC22 is a potent
    analgesic that mitigates the pain sensitivity and neuroinflammation commonly associated with opioids. Furthermore, MC22 inhibits immune cell migration into the central nervous system, which is a critical step in HIV-mediated
    neuropathogenesis that leads to NeuroAIDS. MCC22 shows promise as a treatment of both inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions where conventional analgesics have reduced efficacy.

    Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, as such research efforts abound to develop improved therapeutic treatment options. Chemotherapeutic drugs often work through causing DNA damage in cancer cells to elicit anti-tumor responses
    and cell death. Unfortunately, this DNA damage also occurs in healthy cells, leading to serious side effects and increasing the risk of future cancer. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a small molecule (4Ei-10),
    that achieves its anti-cancer effects in two ways: 1) blocking cell proliferation through inhibiting translation of new proteins, and 2) inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through induction of the potent anti-cancer protein, p53.
    Unlike current chemotherapeutic drugs that upregulate p53, 4Ei-10 does so without causing DNA damage, likely circumventing both burdensome side-effects and the risk of developing new cancer. The dual mode of action of 4Ei-10 has the
    potential to act as a “double-edged sword” against particularly aggressive cancers, and could replace or reduce the dosages of traditional, problematic chemotherapeutic drugs.

    The use of human cells as therapeutics is an area of rapid expansion and has made it possible to treat diseases that have no other options available. Development of cellular therapeutics is drastically hindered by labor intensive
    processes required to obtain even small amounts of pure cell populations. Natural Killer (NK) cells have been widely identified as a promising therapeutic for a variety of cancers and viral infections (including HIV), but are resistant
    to gene manipulation and can only be obtained from a blood draw. A related cell population, group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) have been shown to be important for the integrity of mucosal tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract
    and are thought to be important in the formation and homeostasis of secondary lymphoid tissue and could facilitate immune recovery after chemotherapy or bone-marrow transplants. Unfortunately, the only method currently available to
    obtain these cells is to harvest them from surgically removed lymph nodes, tonsils or from aborted fetal tissue. Despite the potential clinical application, this serious limitation has effectively barred any genuine progress in fully
    understanding these cells and/or developing them as a therapeutic.
</p>
,
<p>
    To bypass these limitations, Drs. Michael Verneris, Jeffrey Miller and Bruce Blazar at the University of Minnesota developed methods to create large quantities of NK cells or ILC3 cells from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In the case
    of NK cells, this technology could facilitate genetic manipulation of NK cells (which are inherently resistant to gene editing) by introducing alterations to HSCs prior to differentiation. This includes the addition of a chimeric
    antigen receptor (CAR) that would allow re-directing NK cells to tumor antigens. This technology also represents the first method to produce ILC3 cells in high numbers. This approach would not use lymph node biopsies, tonsillectomies or
    human fetal tissue. This work will facilitate foundational clinical trials of ILC3 adoptive transfer which could serve as novel studies in areas of chemotherapy induced mucosal injury .

    The hunt for cancer therapies continues to be a major field of study in academia and industry. Unfortunately, many anti-cancer drugs with promising in vitro efficacy are found to be ineffective in vivo. This is due in large part to the
    limitations of current in vitro models. Conventional 2D monolayer cell cultures cannot accurately mimic characteristics of native tumor microenvironments, and current 3D cultured tumor cells, while able to more closely mimic natural
    behaviors, still cannot model the tumor microenvironment. To better utilize resources (including time, research animals and funds) and increase clinical translation, models that more accurately mimic both tumor environment and behavior
    are needed. To that end, researchers at the University of Minnesota developed a method to bioprint 3D tumor models with increased functionality and relevance, bridging the gap between 2D cell cultures and animal models.
</p>
,
<p>
    The design incorporates the vasculature and stromal elements involved in tumor microenvironments (e.g., tumor cells, fibroblasts and blood vessels). The model also facilitates control of tumor cell migration and angiogenesis by creating
    chemical gradients of growth factors using 3D printed stimuli-responsive capsules. Altogether, this approach recapitulates physiological cell–to-cell, cell–to-extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell–to-chemical signal interactions with
    precise spatiotemporal resolution. In addition, the constructs consist of human cells, rendering them more clinically relevant and versatile with the option to incorporate a patient\'s own cells for precise selection of effective
    therapies.This innovation provides a powerful tool for understanding the mechanism of cancer metastasis, screening drugs and testing patient specific therapies.

    Microbial contamination of grains, powdered food ingredients and read-to-eat food products can result in serious illness upon consumption. Therefore, food manufacturers are required to implement pasteurization procedures to
    decontaminate their products before packaging. In addition, recalls of food are expensive and can damage manufacturers’ reputations. Using traditional thermal methods such as hot air or steam can change the quality of food, and are not
    suitable for pasteurization of flour or other powdered or particulated foods. In addition, poor heat transfer properties render this process inefficient. Non-thermal treatment methods such as X-rays and UV light, on the other hand, can
    cause significant chemical and physical damage to the food. Therefore, an efficient and effective food pasteurization method with minimum quality changes is needed. \n
</p>
,
<p>
    Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel method for pasteurization of food using intense pulsed light and low temperature microwave technology, along with a photocatalyst and a microwave absorbent, to
    effectively decontaminate granular or powdered food and food ingredients while using low energy. This process has been shown to reduce the microbial count in wheat kernels by over 3-5 logs in less than 30 seconds. As the product
    temperature during processing is maintained under 60°C, no (or minimal) change in food quality is seen. In addition, this process is directly applicable to powdered or particulated foods such as wheat flour, non-fat dry milk (NFDM),
    spices, wheat kernels, etc. Researchers have tested the effectiveness of this process by inactivating a variety of microbial contaminants (such as C. sakazakii, E. faecium, B. cereus) that are commonly found in food. \n

    Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic, incurable disease affecting 1.5 million Americans with an estimated 40,000 new cases each year. Healthcare associated expenses and lost income due to T1D is estimated at $14 billion annually. T1D is
    treated with regular administration of insulin, however the rising cost of insulin has led patients to ration treatment with devastating effects. 1 in 4 patients have reported cost-related insulin underuse resulting in poor glycemic
    control. Consequently, premature deaths related to such non-adherence are on the rise. T1D results from an autoimmune response in which the body attacks its own insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells. As a result, the pancreas cannot
    produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. This can cause complications ranging from blindness, kidney failure to early death.
</p>
,
<p>
    Researchers at the University of Minnesota seeking to find new interventions for diabetes identified serpin B13 proteinase inhibitor as a potential target for diabetes treatment. The scientists developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb)
    targeting serpin B13 (clone B29) that shows promise as a novel treatment strategy for T1D. When administered to diabetes prone mice, the antibody reduces the number of inflammatory cells (associated with an auto-immune response) and
    leads to increased proliferation of beta cells in the animals. This approach is particularly promising as a human therapeutic since studies in humans have shown that natural serpin B13 autoantibodies are associated with positive
    outcomes in T1D. Instructively, high levels of serpin B13 autoantibodies were correlated with lower risk for T1D. Building on the efficacy observed with the mouse mAb, it is anticipated that a humanized version of the antibody will
    prevent immunogenic effects while offering therapeutic relief.
</p>
,
<p>
    Due to its ability to reduce inflammation and induce tissue regeneration, this novel humanized mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting serpin B13 may also prove therapeutic for inflammatory and/or central nervous system diseases
    (e.g., bone fractures, ulcerated skin lesions/wounds, multiple sclerosis, lupus, hair loss, etc.).

    This technology encompasses novel vaccine adjuvants with limited systemic exposure. The development of vaccines based on antigen subunits have been plagued by struggles with inducing the necessary T-cell response to confer protection
    while maintaining minimal toxicity. This technology overcomes these challenges using a two-pronged approach. First, the use of novel agonists for TLR7 and TLR8 trigger a prominent T-cell response. Second, conjugation of these agonists
    to a biomolecule that is trafficked to lymph nodes elicits focused immunostimulation. The sum product is a covalent conjugate that is “immune silent” until it travels to the lymph node where it is unmasked, leading to potent adjuvantic
    effects with negligible systemic exposure.
</p>
,
<p>
    Due to their ability to stimulate strong T-cell responses, TLR7 and TLR8 agonists have been prime targets for development as adjuvants. Unfortunately, their propensity to diffuse out of the vaccination site and cause systemic exposure
    and toxicity has been a major drawback. This technology identified novel TLR7/TLR8 stimulating compounds (C2-phenolic imidazoquinoline derivatives) and conjugated them to Hyaluronic Acid (HA) for targeting to lymph nodes. Other
    technologies have attempted similar lymph node delivery, but the strategies or compounds employed to do so are often incredibly complex. HA as a natural biopolymer is optimal for this purpose, with ideal biodegradability,
    biocompatibility and an excellent clinical track record. HA also serves to mask the reactive portions of the agonists and the adjuvant remains unreactive until it is delivered to the target lymphoid tissue and unmasked.

    Adjuvants are required to potentiate the immune response to increase efficacy and longevity of many vaccines. The need for new adjuvants is becoming increasingly recognized. The few adjuvants that are commercially available fall into a
    small number of classes, and the creation of new adjuvants has been hindered by issues of toxicity. Using systematic high-throughput screening, the very first heterocyclic small molecule capable of simulating the immune receptor TLR-2
    was identified. Through stimulation of cytokines and chemokines, this molecule (9-fluoro-7-hydroxy-3-methyl5-oxo-N-(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H,5H-pyrido [3,2,1-ij]quinoline-6-carboxamide) is available for development as an
    adjuvant in vaccines as well as in the treatment of certain cancers.
</p>
,
<p>
    Currently, the two most common adjuvants are aluminum- or lipopeptide- based. Aluminum alone is a poor inducer of T-cell response, which is necessary particularly for protein or subunit based vaccines. While lipopetide-based adjuvants
    are much better at priming T-cells to respond to introduced antigen, they suffer from problems of aggregation, which complicates their purification and characterization. This technology has the potential to overcome both of these
    hurdles through activation of TLR-2 via a novel structure (avoiding issues of aggregation). This class of compounds has the potential to serve as a potent adjuvant (alone or in combination) for a wide variety of vaccines; reducing the
    antigen concentration required in vaccines as well as the overall number of immunizations necessary to confer protection, leading to more cost effective vaccines. TLR-2 stimulating compounds have also shown promise for potentiating
    T-cell responses against tumors making this molecule a prime target for development as an anti-cancer therapeutic.

    New enhanced-affinity MHCII molecules could improve current research tools for the study of CD4 T cells during cancer, infections, and autoimmune disease. A novel process uses directed evolution to create modified MHCII molecules with
    better binding affinity than their wild-type counterparts for the co-receptor CD4 found on T cell surfaces.
</p>
,
<p>
    Current methods for detecting and understanding specific types of T cells are imperfect. A CD4 T cell uses its unique T-cell receptor (TCR) molecules to bind to a foreign peptide embedded in an MHCII molecule on host cells. At the same
    time, the T cell’s CD4 molecules bind to the stalk of the MHCII molecules and cooperate with the TCR to activate the T cell. Peptide:MHCII tetramer-based flow cytometry is a preferred method for the study of CD4 T cells specific for
    MHCII-bound peptides from microbes, cancers, and autoantigens. Unfortunately, peptide:MHCII tetramers do not bind to CD4 molecules and therefore fail to detect CD4 T cells with low affinity TCRs. This new technology creates a new
    generation of modified MHCII molecules evolved to bind CD4 with stronger affinity than wild-type MHCII molecules. Tetramers formed with peptide-bound CD4 affinity-enhanced MHCII tetramers detect T cells that are missed by peptide-bound
    wild-type MHCII tetramers. This technology allows researchers to detect more relevant T cells than currently possible.

    New membrane-permeable synthetic peptides could slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. These new peptides inhibit tau phosphorylation by targeting specific and multiple phosphorylation sites. This halts
    disease progression by inhibiting tau mislocalization to dendritic spines and subsequent tau-mediated neural deficits. The technology is anticipated to treat Alzheimer’s disease and other tau-associated neurodegenerative conditions
    (e.g., frontotemporal dementia, traumatic brain injury, chronic traumatic encephalopathy).
</p>
,
<p>
    Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has two main pathological hallmarks: beta-amyloid (Aβ) forming plaques and neurofibrillary tangles containing phosphorylated tau protein. No therapeutics currently exist that can slow or stop AD progression.
    Hyperphosphorylation of tau is associated with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Preventing hyperphosphorylation has become a key strategy. Previous attempts to treat AD by blocking tau phosphorylation failed because inhibiting
    the kinases (including CDK5 and GSK3) also shuts down other necessary cellular processes, leading to high toxicity. These two new peptides (termed WT and AP) prevent tau hyperphosphorylation. They act as targets for kinases so they do
    not hyperphosphorylate the tau protein. The WT peptide acts as a competitive inhibitor for the two kinases; the peptide becomes phosphorylated and native tau is not hyperphosphorylated. The AP modified peptide is unable to be
    phosphorylated but instead binds with the kinases, essentially “distracting” the kinases from native tau by so they phosphorylate native tau to a lesser extent. Because the peptides do not affect the global kinase activities of CDK5 and
    GSK3, they are likely to be highly effective without high toxicity.

    A new biosynthetic pathway leads to synthesis of serofendic acid, a potent neuroprotectant compound. The process begins by using a Streptomyces host bacteria to synthesize ent-atiserenoic acid (EAA), a precursor molecule in synthesizing
    serofendic acid with high yields. Serofendic acid has been shown to be an effective neuroprotectant that protects various cell types (neurons, cardiomyocytes, epithelial cells) from reactive oxygen species that can cause apoptosis.
    Neuroprotectants may be able to treat diseases such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, ALS and Huntington’s disease. This biosynthetic pathway opens up cost-effective options for further research.
</p>
,
<p>
    Chemical synthesis of serofendic acid is too expensive for feasible commercialization, and often requires 15 or more steps and results in less than 10% yield. Standard microbial organisms (yeast and E. coli), used in isolating other
    natural compounds, don’t work for serofendic acid. Therefore, researchers are recreating pathways in microbial hosts such as Streptomyces, which appear to have unique capabilities for making certain types of natural products. This new
    biosynthetic pathway offers both a shorter and higher yielding synthesis of serofendic acid. It is also much more cost effective than the typical purification methods from fetal calf serum. The process harnesses microbe pathways to make
    EAA in a more cost effective manner. In addition, it may be used to create other “natural products” for pharmaceutical and agricultural products related molecules, that weren’t possible using yeast or E. coli.

    A novel metabolomics method can detect pre-invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells by measuring aerobic glycolysis (conversion of glucose to lactate). The ability of cancer cells to produce lactate through aerobic glycolysis is a
    hallmark of cancer, and increased glucose uptake and elevated aerobic glycolysis are closely correlated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.\n \nPre-invasive or metastatic cancer cells have dramatically increased
    production of 3-13C-lactate produced from 1-13C-glucose, over non-invasive cancer cells. By measuring the rate of aerobic glycolysis, which closely correlates with glucose uptake and lactate production in cancer cells, this technology

    New compounds inhibit activity of multiple bacterial histidine kinases (HKs) and hold potential as therapeutics or antibiotics. These scaffolds could provide valuable starting points for designing broadly effective HK inhibitors,

    respond to their environment. The new antibacterial compounds attenuate these signaling pathways by broadly targeting the histidine kinase family—they focus on the highly conserved ATP-binding domains in TCSs. Because HKs are very
    specific to bacteria, their inhibitors can target multiple types of bacteria while minimizing the possibility of human toxicity. Multi-targeted therapy may also hinder drug resistance since concurrent mutation of several drug
    target-encoding genes is unlikely.

    A noninvasive technology can treat tooth decay at its earliest sign through remineralization of tooth enamel. This technology combines two nonsurgical methods: polymer-induced liquid precursors (PILPs) and elastin-like recombinamers
    (ELRs). These methods deliver a void-filling organic substrate and supersaturated amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) deep into the lesion.
</p>
,
<p>
    <b>Early stage lesions</b> (e.g., white spot lesions): PILP is used to form a liquid-like amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) that infiltrates into porous substrates and crystallizes to form hydroxyapatite nanocrystals. This process stops
    and reverses lesion progression.
</p>
,
<p>
    <b>Larger enamel defects</b> (caries or erosion): a combination of PILP and ELRs is used. ELRs are used first to fill in large voids/gaps on the damaged enamel surface, and then the PILP process infiltrates ACP into the ELR matrices and
    the interstitial spaces between the enamel rods.
</p>
,
<p>
    Traditionally, dental caries are treated by removing affected enamel and replacing it with restorative materials while a “wait and see” approach is adopted for early lesions. This new technology treats lesioned teeth at first clinical
    sign, thus stopping lesion progression and helping to avoid tooth excavation. And while a few remineralization/regeneration products currently exist, they have had little success. These products use unstabilized calcium and phosphate
    ions to remineralize/prevent enamel lesions, but can be ineffective due to the shallow penetration of these ions. In contrast, this new technology offers a much deeper penetrating treatment. By delivering supersaturated liquid-like ACP
    directly to the target site, crystallization occurs below the surface of the tooth. In order to avoid the interference of saliva, the PILP solution is placed in a container/tray where the ACP can quickly remineralize enamel lesions.
    While PILP and ELRs have been used independently, this technology uniquely uses them together to remineralize and restore the structure, composition and mechanical properties, as well as aesthetic appearance, of intact enamel.

    New tetrapeptide amino acid compounds can be developed into weight management drugs to treat obesity or stimulate appetite in underweight patients. These structures bind to both the melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 receptors, which are
    involved in appetite and weight control. They have a unique dual pharmacological profile: simultaneously activating the melanocortin-3 receptor and blocking activation of the melanocortin-4 receptor. In addition, a series of closely
    related new compounds called retro-inverso isomers selectively block the activation of the melanocortin-3 receptor but neither activates nor blocks the melanocortin-4 receptor.
</p>
,
<p>
    While many signaling systems control appetite and body weight, two melanocortin receptors are critical in controlling appetite and mediating weight. The melanocortin-4 receptor affects immediate satiety and the melanocortin-3 receptor
    affects long-term energy needs and food consumption. Current anti-obesity drugs targeting the melanocortin-4 receptor have a number of side effects, including increased blood pressure. Evidence suggests that targeting the melanocortin-3
    receptor would induce weight loss without increasing blood pressure. The new ligands activate the melanocortin-3 receptor addressing the problem of obesity and its comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension), while
    the ligands that block the activation of the malanocortin-4 receptor could induce an increase in appetites and address related diseases such as cachexia, the general wasting due to chronic illnesses (e.g., HIV/AIDS, some cancers).

    ADA-07 is a novel potent T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) inhibitor that effectively suppresses solar ultraviolet (SUV) induced skin carcinogenesis. The novel compound, 5-((1s, 3s)-adamantan-1-yl)-3-(hydroxyimino)
    indolin-2-one, directly inhibits TOPK, an upstream activator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades involved in inflammation, DNA damage and tumor development. Testing shows ADA-07 is a promising chemopreventive or
    potential therapeutic agent against SUV-induced skin carcinogenesis.

<p>
    T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), an oncogenic protein involved in various cellular functions, is highly expressed in many cancers. While evidence suggests that inhibiting TOPK might be useful in cancer chemoprevention and
    treatment, very few effective TOPK inhibitors have been discovered. Targeting SUV-induced signaling could be an effective chemoprevention and chemotherapy strategy against skin cancer. ADA-07 is a T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase
    (TOPK) inhibitor that may prevent and treat SUV-induced skin carcinogenesis by directly targeting (inhibiting) TOPK.

    Topical and systemic medications currently exist on the market, but none effectively or quickly deliver long-lasting medications to their targeted area. For example, current delivery mechanisms for throat sprays typically do not deliver
    effectively to the targeted area and do not guarantee repeatedly reliable dosing. Lozenges deliver a targeted topical therapy to an intended area but do not provide long-lasting relief. Systemic products taken orally (e.g.,
    anti-inflammatory NSAIDs, ibuprofen) can take up to 45 minutes to achieve relief. Current products do not address the most important three components (rapid onset, targeted therapy and long lasting relief), but this new technology does.

    A new technology targets asymmetrically signaling homodimers using biased unmatched bivalent ligands (BUmBLs). Four new compounds have a functional effect on melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) signaling and are the first-ever melanocortin
    biased ligands that favor cAMP signaling pathways over β-arrestin recruitment pathways when targeting the MC4R. This strategy is the first to pharmacologically target allosteric signaling between G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)
    homodimers and can be applied easily both in vitro and in vivo to various GPCR systems. In addition, the technology can create other bivalent ligands for different GPCRs because the pharmacophores on either end are easily swapped out to
    target different receptors, making it a mix-and-match pharmacophore system that should be able to use any known pharmacophore. These valuable chemical probes can be used to study melanocortin signaling in disease states and disorders in
    which melanocortin receptors are implicated (e.g., cancer, skin pigmentation disorders, social disorders, sexual function disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, cachexia and obesity).
</p>
,
<p>
    While G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are typically targeted as monomers, they also form dimers and oligomers that have recently become new therapeutic targets. GPCRs that form homodimers that can asymmetrically signal are usually
    targeted by using two monovalent ligands and a complicated, time consuming dosing strategy that is difficult to apply in vivo. Currently, no therapeutics exist that can target asymmetric signaling of GCPR homodimers. This new technology
    allows for targeting this asymmetric signaling since each end of the bivalent ligand can contain a different pharmacophore. The two identical receptors that form the homodimers are targeted by these new bivalent ligands that have a
    C-terminal scaffold and N-terminal scaffold linked by a PEG or Pro-Gly linker. Differential functional effects are possible, depending on the pharmacophore used. Linking two pharmacophores to create a bivalent ligand solves the
    difficult dosing problem with monovalent compounds, making these molecules more effective in vivo than current therapeutics. These novel pharmacological probes may be useful in studying biased ligand signaling and may offer novel drug
    targeting strategies.

    Fluorophore conjugated beta-lactone (β-lactone) chemical probes can selectively label penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). The selective activity-based probes for PBP labeling in S. <i>pneumoniae</i> use novel β-lactone scaffolds and
    uniquely feature PBP2x localization at both the septal ring and the center of the septa during division. Adding clickable groups or affinity groups such as biotin can isolate the PBPs and proteins associated with them in the cell. The
    probes enable imaging and visualization of specific PBPs expressed and catalytically active in bacteria by conjugation to fluorophores and through click chemistry handles. The compounds have potential for studying specific PBPs, their
    physiological role in bacteria, and their mechanisms of resistance. Advancing knowledge of the physiological role of specific PBPs may allow development of new and selective PBP inhibitors. Additionally, these probes could serve as
    safer molecular diagnostic tools that aid in identifying resistant bacterial strains and contribute to personalized therapies.
</p>
,
<p>
    Fluorescently labeled antibiotic probes bind to PBPs along an antibiotic backbone consisting of a β lactam antibiotic. The binding process allows for specific PBP labelling so researchers can visualize activity and isolate PBPs for
    further use (i.e., studying bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, gel-based analysis of penicillin-binding proteins and bacterial imaging applications). Studying PBP activity in cell wall synthesis also lends important insight to bacterial
    resistance mechanisms.
</p>
,
<p>
    PBPs, targets for many antibacterial agents, are involved in the synthesis and crosslinking of the peptidoglycan polymeric structures that comprise bacterial cell walls. Standard methods for detecting PBPs use probes that are
    radioactive and difficult to handle for large scale analysis. Furthermore, current methods are insufficient in the study and characterization of individual PBPs expressed in bacteria, and analysis is time consuming. This new technology
    generates selective activity-based probes to evaluate PBP localization and activity in Streptococcus pneumoniae, where the alternative β-lactones scaffold can generate PBP-selective imaging agents for assessing PBP2x. These
    fluorescently labeled chemical structures can be used for gel-based analysis of penicillin-binding proteins and bacterial imaging applications. The primary advantage of these probes is their demonstrated ability to selectively probe for
    individual or groups of PBPs, not currently possible with commercial PBP inhibitor-fluorophore conjugates.

    Recombinant immune cells are genetically modified to express a heterologous high affinity IgG Fc receptor. The IgG Fc receptor is a chimeric construct. One iteration is referred to as hCD64/16a, created by cloning cDNAs of CD16a and
    CD64 from human peripheral blood leukocytes and fusing components of these two FcγR cDNAs to create a chimeric receptor. It consists of the extracellular region of CD64 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of CD16a. The CD64 in
    the extracellular domain binds with high affinity to the Fc region of IgG antibodies, and the CD16a transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains then initiate potent cell signaling. The recombinant immune cells provide a sustained cytotoxic
    immune response against a target (i.e., tumor cells) in the presence of therapeutic antibodies. Moreover, it is possible to attach therapeutic antibodies to cells expressing hCD64/16a prior to administering them into patients, thus
    providing two potential clinical benefits: 1) reducing the amount of therapeutic antibody normally administered to the patient, and 2) directing hCD64/16a-expressing cells to sites of cancer, using the attached antibody as an
    interchangeable targeting element.
</p>
,
<p>
    Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for therapeutic purposes (i.e., infectious diseases, chronic diseases, and cancer) has become one of the fastest growing classes of drugs, but their efficacy is limited by intrinsic low affinity IgG Fc
    receptors in patients and non-responsiveness of some malignancies/diseases to antibody therapies. Augmenting Fcγ receptor interactions with therapeutic antibodies may improve therapeutic antibody efficacy. This new hCD64/16a construct
    is expected to bind therapeutic mAbs with high affinity and deliver a potent intracellular signal. In addition, therapeutic hematopoietic cell lines (e.g., NK92 cells), human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem
    cells (ESCs) can be differentiated into effector leukocytes, and primary leukocytes can be engineered to express hCD64/16a to be used for cellular adoptive transfer therapy.

    Targeted nucleases are used for the first time to optimize gene editing in primary human natural killer (NK) cells. The new method, which boasts never-before-seen efficiencies, includes a genome-edited primary NK cell, methods for
    editing a primary NK cell genome, and methods of administering a genome-edited primary NK cell. The primary NK cell may be rested or stimulated: it may be a CD3-CD56+ cell or a stimulated NK cell. This success of this high efficiency
    gene editing approach stems from optimized culture conditions, electroporation protocol, and using an “all RNA,” chemically modified CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA system and high quality Cas9 mRNA/proteins. The genome-edited primary NK cells show
    potential in cancer immunotherapy, as the technology can be used to knock out or edit specific genes to enhance NK cells’ ability to expand, survive, and/or kill cancer cells.
</p>
,
<p>
    Human natural killer (NK) cells are notoriously difficult to work with in culture, and to date, using target nucleases in primary human NK cells has not been demonstrated. NK cells are a viable alternative to using T cells for
    immunotherapy, as they persist longer and do not face rejection issues. Furthermore, NK cells do not require a CAR or other engineered receptor to find cancer cells. Biotherapeutics are currently limited by the half-life of protein
    therapies: proteins delivered to cells eventually break down in the body and must be replaced. This technology provides a longer-lasting supply of necessary proteins to patients and can be customized as an anti-cancer therapy to kill
    the patient’s own cancer cells.

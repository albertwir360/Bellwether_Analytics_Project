Enhancement of Immune Response to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) Vaccine by Interferon Alpha," Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a major problem for hog farmers worldwide. PRRS is caused by a virus which leads to reproductive failure in sows and respiratory problems in piglets and growing pigs. The PRRS virus spreads rapidly, leading to large economic losses for farmers and overall lower health for pigs. Currently, PRRS is controlled by inoculating pigs with modified live virus which stimulates the immune system of pigs against the PRRS virus. However, this therapy does not prevent PRRS virus infection and is limited by individual pigs ability to create a strong immune response against the vaccine. The current technology is a composition and method for use that enhances the immune response to PRRS vaccine for the purpose of improving the vaccines efficacy against the PRRS virus.One of the challenges with PRRS is that the PRRS virus is resistant to pigs natural immune response. The PRRS virus is able to hide from the natural defense system by being resistant to signals that alert the body of the viruses presence. Interferon-a is one such alert signal that PRRS virus fails to up-regulate. The current technology uses plasmids (or related technologies) to increase interferon-a production during administration of modified live virus vaccine. By doing so, interferon-a interacts with T cells to create virus specific interferon-? secreting cells. The result is a robust immune system response to the vaccine which should strengthen the immune systems ability to fight infection of PRRS virus.ApplicationsCan be used as a supplement to PRRS vaccines for swineHas broad application for hog farmers and veterinary clinicsBenefitsStrengthened immune system: In vivo application of interferon-a and modified live virus to pigs resulted in over 3x as many virus specific interferon-? secreting cells as modified live virus application alone Reduction in abortion/still births: Amount of PRRS virus specific interferon-? secreting cells is positively correlated with reduction of abortion/still births in sows"
Therapeutic Scheme for Human Basigin," Cancer researchers are focusing their efforts on identifying central pathways that trigger or enhance the invasiveness of tumor cells. One such target is EMMPRIN (Extracellular Matrix Metalloproteinase Inducer). It has been shown that EMMPRIN expression is linked to various cell signaling pathways that lead to an increase in tumor cell vascularization. Researchers are focusing efforts on elucidating the role of EMMPRIN in a number of disorders including cancer, arthritis, tissue repair and numerous inflammation-dependent diseases. DESCRIPTION/DETAILS Basigin is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily thatis also known as EMMPRIN. Human basigin is expressed as two differentiallyspliced isoforms encoded by a single gene found on chromosome, renamedrespectively as basigin-1 and basigin-2. Attempts to demonstrate specifichemophilic on separate cells, or between soluble forms of recombinant basiginusing surface Plasmon resonance have not been successful, suggesting thatbasigin-2 cannot function as a receptor for itself. In order to identify possible receptors for soluble basiginligand, an affinity purification approach was employed. This approach resulted inthe labeling of several potential interacting proteins, and MALDI MS/MSsequencing of one of these proteins identified a novel isoform of human basigin(basigin-3).Immunoprecipitation studies using cell fractions revealed thatrBSG interacts with basigin-2 at the cell membrane, and subsequently interactswith the basigin-3 isoform within the cell. Small-interfering RNA (siRNA)knockdown of basigin-2 protein reduced, but did not eliminate, rBSG-mediatedERK activation in HESCs, suggesting that additional cell surface receptors forsoluble basigin may exist. Taken together, these results support the hypothesisthat basigin-2 can function as a receptor for soluble basigin and demonstratethat the hemophilic interactions between basigin proteins are not dependentupon glycosylation of the basigin ligand. It has also been shown that soluble EMMPRIN binds tomembrane-bound EMMPRIN and the bound complex is internalized presenting apotential means to deliver therapeutic compounds to the cell in a highlytargeted manner. A therapeutic scheme isproposed that aims to design EMMPRIN-conjugates designed to deliver cancertherapeutics in a targeted fashion.ApplicationsConjugation oftherapeutics to EMMPRIN increases specificity and targets cancers cells cancer (skin, bladder,breast); other inflammatory diseases (arthritis, endometriosis); Upregulationof inflammatory response.BenefitsIt is possible to design therapeutic agents directed toward human basigin. Possible therapeutic scheme to block tumor progressionor inflammation."
"Biosynthesis of Lantibiotics: In vitro semi-synthetic production methods for generation of industrial antibiotic, Lacticin 481"," This invention allows the engineering of semi-synthetic lantibiotics to a much larger extent than using typically practiced in vivo methods. The method is the first in vitro reconstruction lantibiotic photosynthesis and introduces non-proteinogenic amino acids.Lantibiotics are peptide-based compounds produced by bacteria that live on lactic acid. They are used as natural antibiotic food preservatives as an alternative to chemical reagents and have been used for half a century without any significant signs of lantibiotic-resistant bacteria popping up.Researchers at the University of Illinois have isolated and purified the LctM enzyme, responsible for synthesis of lacticin 481.

"Gene Cluster Capable of Enabling the Biosynthesis of the Antimicrobial Compound, Rhizocticin In Bacillus subtilis"," Phosphonic and phosphinic acids are bioreactive compounds that have been used as antibiotics, antifungal agents, antimalarial drugs, and herbicides. Rhizocticins are naturally occurring phosphonates produced by Bacillus subtilus that have antifungal properties and interfere with the biosynthesis of the amino acid threonine. By varying the N-terminal amino acid group in the rhizocticin compound, it is possible to alter its biological activity. In particular, oligopeptides that are created by varying this amino acid could potentially allow enhanced capability for controlling selectivity for targeting particular organisms. As a result, compounds are less toxic to the host species and hold more promise for creating therapeutics. Despite the potential for making these types of compounds, organic synthesis has never been achieved due largely in part to the fact that the biosynthetic pathway has not been well understood. University of Illinois scientists have now identified the gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of rhizocticin in B. subtilis, making biosynthesis of rhizocticin compounds possible.DetailsOriginal attempts to isolate and identify this unquie cluster failed, however, the genome of a specific strain of B. subtilis was sequenced and open reading frame locations were determined and annotated. Upon comparison with a non-rhizocticin-producing strain of B. subtilis, the rhizocticin biosynthetic gene cluster was able to be identified and isolated. There are more than 10 genes in the B. subtilis rhizocticin cluster. The biosynthetic pathway was proposed using sequence homology (similarity) for each of the genes. One particular gene in the cluster was identified by the inventors as being unique to this biosynthetic pathway. The cluster responsible for rhizocticin was verified by successfully inserting it into a non-producing strain of B. subtilis.ApplicationsPharmaceutical industry: Synthesis of biologically active compounds and analogs of rhizocticin.Production of novel oligopeptides with therapeutic propertiesAgricultural industry: HerbicideBenefitsThe identification of specific gene cluster for biosynthesis of rhizocticin allows:Specific synthesis of compounds;Control of biological activity of compounds; andControl of compound toxicity in mammals"

Self-Assembled Nanometer Scale Lipid Bilayers for Drug Discovery and Therapeutic Delivery," One of the most challenging problems in biochemical science are studies that involve membranes, including small molecules and proteins which are associated with these cellular structures. Using designed amphipathic helical peptides, termed membrane scaffold proteins (MSPs), the Sligar laboratory has developed a simple and robust system that self-assembles phospholipids into soluble discoidal phospholipid bilayers of defined size (8-16 nm in diameter) termed Nanodiscs.Importantly, the same self-assembly process can be used to directly incorporate a variety of integral membrane proteins and small molecules into Nanodiscs. The result is a native-like environment that provides stability and full functionality for these integral membrane protein targets.Using MSPs of varying lengths, the size and composition of the Nanodiscs can also control the oligomerization state of incorporated targets. Additionally, the Sligar laboratory has demonstrated the usefulness of Nanodiscs in a variety of in vivo applications including imaging, delivery of therapeutics and in providing a naturalistic presentation of antigens for control of the immune response.ApplicationsAll classes of membrane proteins can be effectively solubilized using the Nanodisc technology, including; receptors, for example G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which account for over 50 percent of drug targets; membrane bound enzymes such as the cytochromes P450 and in providing a precisely controlled membrane surface for control of biological processes such as blood coagulation and hemostasis.Additionally, since the Nanodisc incorporated target can be easily affixed to surfaces without loss of activity, the technology has direct application to uses in high-throughput screening modalities for drug discovery. All assay formats utilized for soluble targets are now applicable to those involving membranes and membrane proteins.Nanodiscs can be generated with natural or synthetic phospholipids, and can be formed pyrrogen free and suitable for in vivo therapeutic delivery allowing numerous applications in the fields of biologicals and small molecule drugs. The availability of lipid or covalent anchoring has also enabled use in the delivery of nucleic acid based therapeutics. "
Compounds That Selectively Induce Cancerous Cell Death in the G1 Phase of the Cell Cycle," Malignant melanoma is a cancer that is refractory to current chemotherapeutic treatments. The average survival time for patients is 6 months. This coupled with the alarming rise in incidence of melanoma (46,170 cases of in situ melanoma are expected to be newly diagnosed in 2005) warrants research into novel means to treat melanoma. Through the synthesis of a combinatorial library of potential proapoptotic agents, a novel class of small molecules (triphenylmethylamides, TPMAs) have been identified that are effective agents in killing melanoma cells, as well as other cancer cells. The majority of anticancer drugs operate through induction of cell cycle arrest and cell death in either the DNA synthesis (S) or mitosis (M) phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, these TPMAs, act in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Many of the TPMAs are quite potent inducers of apoptotic death in melanoma cell lines (IC50 of 0.5 ?M), and importantly, some TPMAs are comparatively nontoxic to normal cells isolated from the bone marrow of healthy donors. Furthermore, the TPMAs dramatically reduce the level of active nuclear factor ?-B (NF?B) in the cell; NF?B is known to be constitutively active in melanoma, and this activity is critical for the proliferation of melanoma cells and their evasion of apoptosis. With regard to status of development, multiple generations of compounds have been tested and have shown efficacy with primary melanocytes, while these same compounds have shown to be largely non-toxic in initial rodent studies assessing changes in body weight and death. In addition, the National Cancer Institute?s 60-cell line screen has demonstrated activity of the compounds against a broad range of cancer types. Additional detailed information about this technology can be found in the recently published article: Synthesis and Identification of Small Molecules that Potently Induce Apoptosis in Melanoma Cells through G1 Cell Cycle Arrest (JACS 2005, 127, 8686-8696)ApplicationsChemotherapeutic treatment of Melanoma Chemotherapeutic treatment against other cancers, such as breast, colon, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), etc.As a research reagent that arrests cells in G1. BenefitsPotent death inducers in melanoma cell lines with potencies in the 0.5 - 1.0 M rangeMarkedly less (8-12-fold) toxicity to the non-cancerous human bone marrow cellsNational Cancer Institute's 60-cell line screen demonstrated the compounds are quite active against a broad spectrum of cancers and confirmed the IC50 value of 600 nM against the UACC-62 melanoma cell line Initial animal testing suggests that mice can tolerate concentrations as high as 200 mg/kg Efficacy and water solubility are being increased as additional chemical modifications are made with later generation compounds "
A2Biosensor: Point-of-Care Ascorbic Acid Sensing for Anterior Penetrating Ocular Globe Injuries," Researchers have developed a point-of care device that can detect a penetrating ocular globe injury.

Adaptive Acquisition and Reconstruction of Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Images," This invention is a new method for real time cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging that produces high-spatial and temporal resolution motion movies of the beating heart non-invasively using a MRI scanner, even in the presence of breathing.MRI's use in the cardiovascular system has been limited. The basic challenge in cardiac MRI is posed by the dynamic motion of the imaged object during the MR data acquisition; unless special methods are adopted this produces unwanted artifacts in the reconstructed MR images in the presence of physiological motion. Also, instead of simply capturing ""snap-shot"" images one could reconstruct a dynamic movie of the moving object, providing further information of possible diagnostic value.Methods designed to deal with the motion of objects caused by the beating of the heart and respiration can be classified into three categories: 1) general fast imaging approaches 2) methods dealing with respiration-induces motion 3) methods dealing with cardiac-induced motion This technology improves on the existing methods in several ways.Does not require breath holding, and the drawbacks associated with it.Acquires data throughout the respiratory cycle and can reconstruct real-time images of a cardiac slice.Uses estimates of the respiration-induced motion to select the ideal set of MR data to be acquired and thus reduces the complexity of the reconstruction algorithm while improving the reconstruction quality.Uses a more accurate motion model for respiratory motion to produce still and moving images with fewer artifacts and wider applicability.Compensates for affine respiration-induce motion exactly. It can also optimize the MR acquisition and reconstruction process and can produce a motion-movie of the dynamically beating heart.Does not assume cardiac cyclicity, acquires data throughout the heartbeat and can produce real-time cardiac motion movies.  Explicitly models the effects of both cardiac and respiration-induced motion effects and hence overcome the drawbacks of these models.BenefitsEasy to integrate - This system can be combined with pre-existing static and dynamic MR imaging methods to make them insensitive to affine respiratory motion and tolerant of more general (non-affine) respiratory motion.Improved image quality - The quality of dynamic cardiac reconstructions obtainable by MR scanners is improved in current applications by reducing image artifacts. Also improves the MR imaging (MRI) of other organs (such as the liver) whose images are otherwise degraded by respiratory motion Extends clinical applications of cardiac MRI - Improves the spatial and temporal resolution and enables real time 3-D imaging.Helps more people - Increases the reach of cardiac MR to a larger set of patients by eliminating constraints imposed by breath-holding requirements."
Chemical Dyes as Contrast Agents for Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)," These patent-pending optical contrast agents and molecular detection technologies were developed to enhance the ability of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to non-invasively map molecules in living specimens and diagnose disease where it starts.

Group Refractive Index Reconstruction with Broadband Interferometric Confocal Microscopy," A system and method for microscale measurement and imaging of the group refractive index of a sample. The method utilizes a broadband confocal high-numerical aperture microscope embedded into an interferometer and a spectrometric means, whereby spectral interferograms are analyzed to compute optical path delay of the beam traversing the sample as the sample is translated through the focus of an interrogating light beam. A determination of group refractive index may serve to disambiguate phase ambiguity in a measurement of refractive index at a specified wavelength. Spatial resolution of object characterization in three dimensions is achieved by imaging the object from multiple viewpoints.Applicable to a variety of industries, this novel method measures Group Refractive Indices of biological tissues at the micron scale and can be applied to several optical imaging techniques, such as Optical Coherence Tomography and Confocal Microscopy. Although the method can be used for non-medical applications, its most beneficial application is in the diagnosis of cancerous cells. It allows for quickly measuring cells' organelles to indentify cancerous properties. Since this method does not require refraction, a larger variety of biological samples can be examined. Hardware is readily available for the application of this method, and the method can be applied to any optical imaging technique due to its universal math. "

By measuring the local wavelength of the shear waves, the shear modulus and viscous coefficient of the medium surrounding the vibrating element are estimated."
Biodegradable Implants and Matrices for Tissue/Bone Repair," These technologies provide biodegradable bone implants and artificial bone matrices for bony tissue repair. They encompass: (1) a method for creating organoapatite (artificial bone) matrices on surgical metal implants, as well as the matrix materials themselves, and (2) a biodegradable polymer matrix for use in bone tissue repair. Both types of material provide immediate tissue treatment or repair, while allowing and encouraging natural repair processes and cell growth to occur gradually. They degrade to biocompatible substances and/or naturally occurring metabolites.These technologies encompass a biodegradable, synthetic polymer for use as a tissue repair matrix, as well as a novel preparatory method for depositing organoapatites onto surgical metal alloys used in implants. The organoapatite matrix materials are included, as well. Both of these types of matrices are designed to promote natural tissue repair processes, following implantation, and to degrade, in situ, to physiologically and biochemically compatible compounds.Biodegradable Amphiphilic Polymer MatrixThis novel material is designed to have a lipophilic binding moiety covalently coupled to a hydrophilic tissue adhesion moiety via a divalent linker comprising either a natural metabolite or a polymer biodegradable into a metabolite. The preparation of these polymers, as well as their use in formulating implant matrices for tissue treatment and repair, is provided as well. Preferred polymers are prepared using a lipophilic alcohol or amine to initiate polymerization of one or more cyclic esters of hydroxyl acids. The resulting polyester is then covalently linked to a polyionic group, via one of several linker moieties. The composition of the matrices can vary from viscous liquid to molded solid, based on its chemical constituents and molecular weights. Specific, preferred matrices exhibit self-assembly, characteristic of liquid crystal compositions, and impart a unique matrix structure and function, with localized, ordered domains. Such domains possess temperature-dependent order, enabling liquid-solid transitions as a function of temperature (i.e., solidifying from a pre-implant liquid to a post-implant solid or liquid crystal). Polymers used in implant compositions degrade after implantation, providing a temporary template for cell growth and localized release of any contained bioactive additives. For tissue repair, the matrix is gradually replaced by endogenous tissue.In addition to being biodegradable, this innovative technology provides a unique matrix structure with localized domains. This property, coupled with its unique molecular structure affords significant potential for making implants with highly improved functionality. In addition, the liquid crystal nature of these matrices enables temperature-dependent ordering, i.e., the ability to change from liquid to solid following a change in temperature from slightly above-normal to normal body temperatures. The implant matrix composition can be used alone or can also contain an effective amount of a bioactive adjuvant (or cells) for tissue treatment/repair. The natural surfactant action of these amphiphilic, biodegradable matrices serves a tissue wetting/adhesive function; this, along with the ordered molecular arrangement, enhances cell growth and tissue regeneration at the implant site.Methodology for Deposition of Organoapatites onto Surgical Metal Alloys Organoapatites can be created by a serial treatment process, wherein a porous metal implant (typically a metal alloy) is immersed in a solution of a charged poly(amine)(s), followed by immersion in a second solution of a second, charged poly(amine)(s), whose charge is opposite that of the first poly(amine) (i.e., poly(lysine) (+) followed by poly(glutamate) (-)). The second polyamine solution may be the poly(amine) alone or in combination with apatite-forming constituents. These steps allow an insoluble, polyionic organic complex to form on the alloy, which serves as a type of scaffold for the subsequent, stable precipitation of apatites onto the coated alloy. The apatite-synthesizing step involves a ratio- and rate-controlled addition of solutions of calcium hydroxide and phosphoric acid to the final poly(amine) solution containing the metal alloy. Organoapatite precipitation occurs onto the alloy within minutes to hours. Following precipitation, the coated alloy is removed, rinsed twice, and vacuum dried, prior to use.Current methods aim to improve the rate of bone osseointegration in cementless systems, either by applying highly crystalline calcium phosphate to porous metal implants, or inserting bone allografts or reconstituted bone at the metal/bone interface. While inviting bone growth, the former method consists of a brittle, ceramic phase that is not fully resorbed and requires a high processing temperature that degrades the mechanical properties of the metal substrate. The latter methods, especially those using synthetic bone materials, are not sufficiently like natural bone in microstructure and/or composition, and bone growth rates are not effectively improved. This technology provides a method for growing fully (or at least partially) resorbable, synthetic bone on the surface of a porous metal implant that can be used to stimulate cellular activity and bone growth, with replacement (at least in part) by natural bone tissue. ApplicationsMedical: Orthopedic implants, prostheses, cellular/tissue repair materials (e.g., viscous liquid, gel, paste, moldable putty, or shape-retaining solid in molded form)Pharmaceutical R & D: Biodegradable polymer delivery systems and/or implantable matrices for targeted tissue repair/treatment agents (e.g., hormones, drugs, cells, bioengineered materials)BenefitsBiodegrades: Synthetic polymers and matrix materials undergo natural degradation to normal metabolites or precursors thereof, eliminating the need for surgical removal of implants.Promotes Tissue Growth and Healing: The amphiphilic nature of the polymer materials, as well as the unique matrix structure, promotes endogenous and/or exogenous cell/tissue adhesion and growth into the implant/matrix.Provides More Durable Implants: The organoapatites make bone-related implants stronger, longer-lasting, and more mechanically compatible.Decreases Likelihood of Extended Hospitalization: Enhanced growth and healing enables stress- and load-bearing to occur gradually, via a more natural process; biodegradation eliminates the need for additional hospitalization for surgical removal of implants.Lowers Costs: Decreased hospitalization durations will yield lower health care costs."
Integrated Portable Pneumatically Powered Ankle-Foot Orthosis," Below the knee muscle weakness, defined by weak dorsiflexor (shin) or plantarflexor (calf) muscle groups, can result from a variety of physical impairments or congenital abnormalities. Stroke, spinal cord injuries, polio and multiple sclerosis are among some of the physical injuries and congenital defects responsible for the condition. The largest complication from below the knee muscle weakness is abnormal gait, which when compensated for can lead to further complications in other muscles and joints.Ankle-foot-orthoses (AFOs) have been designed to assist afflicted individuals in walking and rehabilitation of the weakened muscle groups. Unfortunately, many commercially available AFOs are passive devices that cannot provide assistance during the propulsive phase of gait. Furthermore, these instruments are not capable of adapting to changes in walking conditions. Powered AFOs have been engineered to overcome these limitations but lack practicality in that they are commonly tethered to off-board power sources.This technology provides a non-tethered, portable pneumatic powered AFO that controls and assists propulsion of the foot as well as ankle motion using plantarflexor and dorsiflexor torque at the ankle joint.A custom-built pneumatic rotary actuator is located at the ankle joint. Torque generated by the actuator is used for both motion control of the foot and to provide supplemental torque for the individual during gait. Pressure regulators are used to manage the force produced by the rotary actuator and valves are used to direct the flow of fluid power to the actuator. Control and sensing of the actuator is accomplished through use of pressure and angle sensors and onboard electronics.ApplicationsThis device can be used to aid individuals afflicted with below the knee muscle weakness or impaired gait resulting from any number of physical injuries or congenital disabilities. Portability of the device permits the device to be used in a variety of locations. Applications include:Assistance in walking (including flexibility to walk outside)Relief from pain and discomfort during walkingRehabilitation of dorsiflexors and plantarflexors (possible from the patients personal residence)BenefitsThe portable pneumatic AFO is beneficial compared to passive AFOs in that it:Controls velocity of foot during initial contact to prevent foot-slapProvides torque at end of the stance for propulsionSupports the foot in the neutral, 90 degree position during swing to prevent foot-drop and allow free range of motion throughout the walking cycleEnables full customization of timing and magnitude of assistance through electronic and mechanical meansBenefits over other powered AFOs include:Portable, non-tethered power"

The rapid label-free identification of viruses can bring about a revolution in human health diagnostics and therapeutics.
DNA Sequencing Systems Using Nanoscale Field Effect Sensor Arrays," This invention is a novel approach to performing DNA sequencing-by-synthesis methodology that is anticipated to make DNA sequencing routine, highly accurate and affordable.The approach is a silicon-based field effect nanoscale sensor array using a sequence-by-synthesis methodology. PCR is performed locally in each pixel through the use of recently developed methods for heating fluid using a silicon field effect sensor, and then the amplified molecules in the pixel are detected in a label-free electrical manner where the added charge during the synthesis process is detected using the same thin-film SOI transistor.Cost is significantly reduced since the nucleotides do not need a fluorescent label, there is no need for gel electrophoresis, and the entire machinery of optical signal processing is unnecessary. In addition, since the silicon field effect sensors when used in a nanoscale dimension can be very sensitive and detect the charge from just a few molecules, it is quite feasible that the PCR amplification can be utilized with very few cycles. Reduction of PCR cycling would reduce the usage of costly reagents. The information retrieval can be scaled and the information obtained per unit time is maximized."

Using Organosilacyclobutanes to Form Carbon-Carbon Bonds without Toxic Byproducts," Traditional methods for forming carbon-carbon bonds between unsaturated moieties have a number of well-known difficulties. These cross-coupling reactions often require harsh conditions, use difficult-to-handle precursors, and result in poisonous byproducts. This invention uses known materials-organosilacyclobutanes or simple organosilanols-in a new way to avoid these problems. The process involves subjecting these materials to stereospecific cross-coupling reactions with organic electrophiles in the presence of an activator (either a fluoride source or oxygen-based nucleophile) and a palladium catalyst. Under these mild conditions, carbon-carbon bonds are formed without the toxic byproducts associated with traditional cross-coupling methods.This invention provides a mild, general and stereospecific method for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds between unsaturated moieties without the concomitant production of toxic byproducts. This new method addresses many of the difficulties associated with traditional cross-coupling techniques. By using organosilacyclobutanes or organosilanols, this process eliminates the need for processing in harsh conditions and using difficult-to-handle precursors. Most importantly, it eliminates the toxic byproducts that result from traditional methods. The cross-coupling begins with an organosilacyclobutane or organosilanol that is treated with a fluoride solution. After the initial exotherm subsides, the organic electrophile is added along with the palladium catalyst. The reactions times vary from 10 minutes to 7 hours at room temperature. The products then are isolated by removal of solvent and filtration through silica gel to remove salts and catalyst, followed by distillation. Occasionally filtration through a reverse phase (C-18) chromatography column is necessary to remove the byproduct. The products are formed in 65% to 93% of analytically pure material.Organosilacyclobutanes or organosilanols are a preferable material for cross-coupling reactions:Unlike magnesium and lithium agents, these materials are chemically inert and offer good functional-group compatibilities.Unlike zinc and aluminum agents, these materials are easy to prepare and generate in a geometrically defined form.Unlike tin agents, these materials do not result in toxic, heavy-metal byproducts.Unlike boron agents, these materials are not air sensitive and can be readily carried through synthetic sequences.Unlike previously employed organosilicon reagents, these materials have good reactivity.Unlike fluorosilanes, these materials can be processed at room temperature and are based on easy-to-handle precursors. Unlike orthosiliconates, these materials are not water sensitive and are highly reactive.BenefitsThe benefits of this invention accrue from its use of organosilacyclobutanes or organosilanols as the nucleophilic component in cross-coupling reactions. Unlike the materials used in traditional processes, these silicon-based moieties are chemically inert, have low molecular weight, are easy to introduce in a variety of organic structures, are stable to standard purification procedures, and can be activated by fluoride ions at room temperature. These features make the coupling process less complicated and less dangerous than traditional coupling methods.Simple: This invention eliminates the need for high-temperature processing conditions. Also, the silicon-based materials are easy to synthesize and purify.Low risk: This new process does not require the use of difficult-to-handle precursors traditionally needed for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Organosilacyclobutanes and organosilanols are chemically inert, while the fluoride source and palladium catalyst offer mild reaction conditions.Nontoxic: Unlike tin agents, silicon-based materials have a low molecular weight and do no yield heavy-metal byproducts. Thus, this process can be used in large-scale applications without concern for product contamination or toxic waste streams.Robust: Unlike boron agents, silicon-based materials are not air sensitive and can be carried through synthetic sequences readily."

<p>FRET Based High-Throughput Screening</p>," Advanced molecular imaging tools combined with investigative tools like biochemical and cell based assays have thepotential to unravel complex molecular processes. These tools combined with high throughput screening can significantly impact diagnostics for cancer screening and accelerate drug discovery. These inventions are two new Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) biosensor pairs, one composed of two new colors, mOrange2 and mCherry and the other composed of a modified high-sensitive ECFP/YPet pair that can significantly enhance the dynamic range of a variety of biosensors. The ECFP/YPet can detect signaling events with high spatio-temporal resolutions which makes it an ideal readout indicator for high throughput screening.FRET technology and genetically encoded FRET biosensors are very useful in detecting active molecular events inlive cells with high temporal and spatial resolutions. FRET occurs when two flurophores are in proximity with the emission spectrum of the donoroverlapping with the excitation spectrum of the acceptor. To date, the most popular FRET pair is cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (CFP and YFP).The new FRET biosensor pairs mOrange2/mCherry are proteins with different colors and spectrally distinctive from the CFP/YFP pair. This invention opens up the possibility of lighting two diagnostic biomarkers in the same cell e.g., cancer cells, thus providing a double criterion high-fidelity assay to differentiate cancer vs. normal cells.To provide proof-of-concept that mOrange2 and mCherry are suitable as novel FRET biosensors, they were operably linked to the protein recognition sequence of MMP-MT1. MMP-MT1 is an enzyme belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase family that has known roles in cancer metastasis. The basis of this assay is that when MT1-MMP is inactive, the mCherry and mOrange2 and positioned in proximity and favor a strong FRET between the two moieties. Indeed, in-vitro assays established that the mOrange/mCherry pair can serve as a reliable and sensitive indicator of the status of MT1-MMP activation and can potentially be applied to other biomarker assays.The ECFP/YPet pair provides a high-sensitive biosensor for the visualization of molecular hierarchy at different subcellular locations inlive cells. In-vitro assays revealedthat the ECFP/YPet pair exhibits significantly enhanced dynamic range of the MT1-MMP biosensor compared to currently available CFP/YFP FRET pairs. When quantified, the ECFP/YPet pair showed a 570% change (% change in basal level upon stimulation of MT1-MMP) when compared to only 90-100% in existing FRET pairs. The ECFP/YPet pair has also been successfully applied to other classes of proteins, like kinases, that are important therapeutic targets in human cancer.These and other genetically engineered biosensors can serve as a research tool to monitor different signaling cascades in live mammalian cells with high sensitivity. The developed MT1-MMP biosensor and potentially other protein biosensors can provide a powerful tool for the spatiotemporal imaging of protein functions in cancer development e.g. detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Furthermore, these biosensors can serve as an excellent high-throughput reporting system forthe detection of cancer and the development of inhibitors for cancer therapeutics. BenefitsThe novel mOrange2/mCherry pair presents a method to simultaneously visualize two active signaling events in the same cell when combined with existing FRET pairsThe ECFP/YPet pair can serve as a high-sensitive biosensor with significantly enhanced dynamic ranges compared to existing CFP/YFP FRET pairs. The ECFP/Ypet pair can be operably linked to any protein recognition sequence to detect activity of that protein in live cells. The pair also includes a positively charged tag which allows 100% efficiency ofdetection. This invention demonstrates an ECFP/Ypet pair operably linked to MT1-MMP, a tumor metastasis biomarker, to accurately detect circulating tumor cells in blood samples. "
<p>Bio-Engineered Hyper-Functional Super Helicases</p>,"  Dr. Taekjip Ha has developed a bio-engineered, hyper-functional ""super"" helicase that is capable of unwinding 5000+ base pairs without stopping. The super helicase is designed such that the helicase cannot dissociate until the end of the DNA is encountered, making the processivity of the super helicase theoretically infinite in ideal conditions. Furthermore, it can exert forces in the range of 50-80pN which are currently the strongest helicase forces reported. This super helicase could provide a better alternative to helicases currently used in nanopore sequencing and isothermal PCR. Technology Benefits: Benefits over existing helicases: Natural Rep protein is a very poor helicase which can unwind DNA sequences as short as 18 base pairs (bp), and at very high concentrations, only up to 30-50 bp • Rep-X exhibits extremely enhanced DNA unwinding activity: it can unwind 5000+ bp without stopping • Rep-X is designed in a way that the helicase cannot physically dissociate until the end of the DNA is encountered. • Rep-X is an extremely strong protein, which cannot be stopped by forces up to 80 pN which is above the shearing force of double stranded DNA. By carefully controlling crosslinker length, and specific mutations sites that the crosslinkers target, other helicases can be stabilized in the specific conformation that gives rise to the super-active form (i.e. ""Helicase-X"")."

Ionizable Isotopic Labeling Reagents for Relative Quantification," Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is increasingly being used for metabolic analysis due in part to its widespread availability and compatibility with biological samples. This invention provides ionizable, isotopic labeling reagents and labeling reaction products, answering the current need for relative quantification using mass spectrometry.Absolute quantification of an analyte relies upon the addition of an internal standard differing only in its isotopic form. However, it is impractical to add an isotopic standard for every compound when performing more comprehensive metabolic profiling. Relative quantification between samples is more amenable to analyzing broad classes of compounds, and it often provides very useful biological information.Heavy and light isotopic forms of methylacetimidate have been synthesized and used as labeling reagents for quantification of amine-containing molecules, such as biological samples. Heavy and light isotopic forms of formaldehyde and cholamine have also been synthesized and used independently as labeling reagents for quantification of amine-containing and carboxylic acid-containing molecules, such as these found in biological samples. Advantageously, the labeled end-products are positively charged under normal acidic conditions involving conventional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) applications.This invention improves the precision of relative quantification by minimizing or negating errors associated with run-to-run irreproducibility. Such errors can arise from variations in mass spectrometric detection sensitivity, such as those caused by ionization suppression in electrospray, or from retention time differences between runs. The isotopic pair of labeled compounds co-elute within a single run. Therefore, they have identical retention times and are electrosprayed from identical solution conditions."

New Synthetic Tumor Microenvironments," Researchers from the University of Illinois have developed a new synthetic tissue microenvironment that may give cancer researchers the next-best look at tumor growth and behavior. The 3D patterned vasculature tumor microenvironment is created by changing the flow rates of fluid channels and the structures are made of alginate that was mixed with breast cancer cells in the outer layer and macrophages on the inner layer. The 3D vascularization, a network of capillaries that carry drugs and other materials are created can go from straight, to snakelike, to any shape, that offers modelling for metastasis, because the vessel architecture can be tuned on the ﬂy. The technology accurately predicted the clinically measured EC50 of three drugs: Gefitinib, zoledronic acid, and RAC inhibitor. This quick process to create synthetic tumor microenvironments lends to tremendous potential such as model systems for high-throughput screening for drug efficacy, as well as flowable and vascularized lab-on-a-fiber platforms. Finally, biopsied cancer cells lends to personalized cancer treatments with this device that could realistically and quickly recreate microenvironments found across biology."

    \nTypical wound closure is done by sewing sutures through the opening and pulling the strands together. It presumes the clinician has ready access to the site and free hands/fingers to perform the closure and that the sutures do not get
    entangled during the closing. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a new medical device that allows for the efficient and reproducible closure of wounds, and holes from the installation of chest and surgical
    tubes.This new design enables closing of wounds where the opening may be below another device (e.g. the

    them to address other portions of the anatomy and/or operate other equipment simultaneously. In addition, this design provides reliable wound closure regardless of clinicians skill level.\n

    A new process creates uniquely functional/active textiles using multi-material 3D printing combined with traditional textile equipment (e.g., circular knitting machine). The process involves 3D printing novel, yarn-like filaments with
    strategically varying properties (elasticity/stiffness, conductivity, activation, surface properties, etc.) that can later be formed into a textile/garment.\n

<p>
    This functional compression garment clothing activates upon touching the body and self-fits to the body without a power source. The SMA activated compression garment is passive and loose fitting when cool (i.e., ambient room
    temperatures or even freezing temperatures) and activates to apply pressure on the body as it warms to skin temperature. This approach enables new, dynamic, wearable compression garments with controllable activation and low effort
    donning and doffing.
</p>
,
<p>
    This SMA compression garment provides <b>dynamic compression</b> for therapeutic relief. The garment features nickel titanium (NiTi) alloy SMA spring actuators that contract with heat to provide compressive force when electrical power
    is applied. A novel tension-limiting switch gives patients independent control of compression by applying electrical power to SMA actuators to provide compressive force. The tension switch can also prevent patients from applying an
    incorrect amount of power and/or overheating the SMA springs. The unique feedback mechanism of the tension switch consumes no electrical power; it instead uses the mechanical properties of its material.
</p>
,
<p>
    This technology uses SMA knitted actuators in a novel way to create self-fitting, on-body clothing and wearables. The technology leverages large and controllable displacements, and variable stiffness qualities to make textiles that are
    compliant and flexible in their inactive state, and become stiffer in their active state. SMA textiles are temperature sensitive and could actuate using the body’s thermal energy or other forms of heating. This textile could be used in
    conjunction with high-force SMA textiles in a single garment to provide the necessary fitting for appropriate force output. This material could be used in place of commonly used fasteners/fitting mechanisms, such as lacing, hook and
    loop tape, ratcheting systems, hooks and eyes, zippers, and snaps.\n

    \nElderly trauma patients are at high risk of mortality even when presenting with minor injuries. Providing proper medical care is especially challenging as these patients are medically complex and generate many ethical, financial, and
    moral questions. To support clinical decision making, mortality risk score models such as the Geriartric Trauma Outcome (GTO) score can be used to predict mortality risk in severely injured elderly patients. However, the GTO score
    relies heavily on the injury severity score (ISS), which is retrospective, anatomically based, and fails to account for physiologic status and comorbidities. In addition to applying equal weightage for head injuries and extremity
    injuries, the GTO score depends heavily on whether the patient has received packed red blood cells in the last 24 hours or not. \n<br />

    \nResearchers at the University of Minnesota have developed and validated a novel prognostic scoring model called <u>E</u>lderly <u>M</u>ortality <u>A</u>fter <u>T</u>rauma (EMAT), that can be used to quickly and accurately calculate
    in-hospital mortality risk in elderly trauma patients at admission. Using a combination of factors including the patient’s comorbidities, physiologic parameters, nature and severity of injury, and demographic information, the EMAT score

    Pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are widely used in many applications such as sticky notes, labels, tape, and stamps due to their facile adhesion to substrates with a minimal applied force. Most commercial pressure sensitive adhesive

    \nSeveral million tons of lactose and lactose-rich milk permeate is produced as byproducts every year. To utilize these waste products, few methods to prepare lactose-containing polymers have been proposed. Of those methods, many rely
    on multistep synthesis of monomers often involving protecting group chemistry and organic solvents. \n\n<br />
    <br />
    \nApplying green chemistry principles, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a simple, novel method for the preparation of hydrogels composed of lactose containing polymers. This method involves an environmentally
    friendly, atom-economical reaction conducted in water to synthesize lactose-based methacrylic monomers, and methacrylic acid as a byproduct. This method allows for synthesis of the hydrogel through a simple pH adjustment of the reaction
    mixture followed by photopolymerization. In addition to the light-induced polymerization, the entire process is carried out in a single pot, making this process highly energy efficient, enabling synthesis at ambient temperature, and
    polymerization at high rates. The researchers have demonstrated that the water uptake, rheological and other physical properties can be tuned easily by varying the ratio of methacrylic anhydride to lactose. In addition, the process was

    Conventionally, garments are made to fit complex body shapes using undersized elastic garments and/or closure devices such as braces, ties, cuffs, etc. Undersized garments can be too tight or too loose, and rely on a few contact areas
    on the wearer’s body where tension can be applied, resulting in poor aesthetics. Closure devices, on the other hand, can add to manufacturing complexity and diminish the overall aesthetics. Conventional fabric and fastening mechanisms
    are even more unfavorable in medical wearables, where both uniform compression and continual contact to moving wearer’s body is often necessary; utilizing molding technique or foam inserts to address this problem has been ineffective
    and laborious. \n\n<br />
    <br />
    \nResearchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a new method to create self-fitting fabrics that can conform over complex surfaces such as the human body while maintaining constant compression. This fabric, made by knitting
    filaments of NiTi-based active materials, can be programmed to shape-shift and conform to remain in continual contact with the wearer\'s body even while the wearer is moving/changing postures. In this invention, conformity around
    concave and convex surfaces is achieved by creating spatially varying functional properties through intelligent combination of different knit patterns. The ability to architecture functionally graded active fabric based on knitting
    pattern and material properties offers a level of unparalleled resolution in creating topographical conformation to highly complex surfaces. \n\n<br />

    \nAffinity-based cell separation is a technique in which affinity between a cell-surface biomarker and a complimentary, substrate-bound capture ligand is used to capture specific cells. Affinity-based cell separation offers key

    \nResearchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a method to release affinity-captured cells using a molecular release mechanism that does not damage or alter the cells. This technology uses a molecular recognition and
    release trigger approach that is independent of the capture mechanism, thereby making this method versatile and readily adaptable for any cell type. After capturing the cells, large, specific, non-toxic “molecular trigger” compounds are
    immobilized adjacent to the ligand-cell complexes; as the captured trigger compounds adopt an extended conformation, the ligand-biomarker bond is broken, releasing the captured cells. Combined with affinity-based cell capturing, this
    release technology offers a comprehensive, widely-adaptable platform for effective cell sorting. \n

    \nProf. Lim at the University of Minnesota has developed a new method to suppress and potentially cure tinnitus using synchronized multi-modal stimulation of the brain. The technology consists of algorithms and devices that
    non-invasively or transcutaneously stimulate auditory and non-auditory pathways in a highly synchronized fashion. The technique stems from the hypothesis that tinnitus patients who experience abnormal brain representations continue to
    retain the normal (original) brain representations; and, by “shocking” specific regions of the brain, the brain can be switched back to the normal representation. Using highly synchronized multi-modal stimulation of specific regions in
    the brain, this technology acts as a “neural switch” that can switch neural activity to suppress tinnitus and phantom limb pain.
</p>
,
<p>
    Tinnitus, the perception of sound with no external source, affects 15-20% of the population and currently has no cure. Existing therapies include medications, using masking noises, or simply retraining the brain using individually
    programmed tonal music. While these methods eases tinnitus to a certain degree, they do not address the underlying cause. The technology disclosed here, on the other hand, induces a strong synchronous shock to specific regions of the
    brain to reset it from an abnormal state back to the normal state. Owing to such novel method of action, this non-invasive treatment technology has the potential to successfully switch the firing pattern of tinnitus-affected neurons to
    suppress and cure tinnitus and phantom limb pain. \n

    Bacteria are a major source of infections in both plants and animals, as well as contamination of food products. The consequences of rampant bacterial growth can range from loss of product and capital (in the livestock and agricultural
    industries) to illness and loss of life (in animal and human health). Quorum sensing mediated by acyl homoserine latonces (AHLs) has been implicated in regulating bacterial virulence factors in pathogens including
    <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> (cholera), <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (infections in cystic fibrosis) and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (hospital-acquired infections). The pathogenicity of bacterial plant pathogens including
    <i>Pectobacterium spp</i>. (soft rot and blackleg disease), <i>Erwinia amylovora</i> (fire blight disease) and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> (opportunistic plant pathogen) is also regulated by quorum sensing. Given the widespread
    occurrence of antibiotic resistance it is imperative to find new modalities to combat pathogenic bacteria. Targeting AHLs to decrease or limit the expression of virulence factors could be a powerful tool to combat costly plant, animal
    and human pathogens. Lactonase enzymes that degrade AHLs are being explored as a novel way to inhibit expression of virulence factors and reduce the pathogenicity of bacteria.
</p>
,
<p>
    Bacterial pathogenicity is linked to robust expression of virulence factors. AHL signaling molecules that are widely secreted by bacteria for quorum sensing are implicated in activating the expression of virulence genes and exacerbating
    infections. Lactonases, enzymes that degrade AHLs, are a viable and novel strategy to interrupt quorum sensing and therefore mitigate against bacterial infections. University of Minnesota researchers have engineered lactonases in order
    to maximize enzyme stability and activity against a wide variety of AHLs. These enzymes are capable of disrupting bacterial communication and reducing virulence. The improved solubility, stability and longevity profile of these enzymes
    makes them ideal anti-infectives. Specifically, they can be incorporated in a variety of solvents or coatings, thus rendering them readily deployable on most surfaces. Engineered lactonases are also appealing since their mode of action
    is outside the cells and are unlikely to elicit survival mechanisms that increase the likelihood of resistance development. These enzymes have been found to be non-toxic in animal feed studies and could be used to control microbial
    infections in the livestock industry, in crop production and post-harvest crop storage. Engineered lactonases have the potential to mitigate crop and livestock contamination without the introduction of chemical antibiotics into the food
    chain.

    Bacterial biofilms are significant health challenges. It is estimated that 80% of all microbial infections and 60% of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) in humans are caused by biofilms. The societal costs of HAIs are estimated at
    between $96 to $147 billion annually. Biofilms are characteristically slimy collections of bacteria surrounded by a matrix of DNA, proteins and polysaccharides that can adhere to and grow on a variety of surfaces. Because of the
    pervasive nature of bacteria, biofilms are incredibly common and can form on substrates, ranging from structural materials to living tissue. As sources of contamination, infection and biocorrosion, biofilms cause of an astounding array
    of problems, including: food contamination and rot, contamination of medical devices and a wide variety of human and animal infections. Biofilms are inherently resistant to antimicrobial agents and their physically sticky nature makes
    them challenging to treat and dislodge. A key step in the formation of many biofilms is bacterial communication through molecules known as quorum signals. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have engineered enzymes to break down
    quorum sensing molecules as a novel way to inhibit bacterial communication and disrupt or prevent biofilm formation.

    Bacterial communication is vital for the formation of biofilms and interfering with this communication may mitigate against biofilm formation. Bacteria often secrete acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), a molecule required for quorum

    More than $300 Billion is lost from the US economy every year due to metal corrosion. Where metal structures are submerged underwater, bacteria drastically speed up corrosion through the formation of complex microbial communities called
    biofilms. Multiple approaches have been attempted to combat biocorrosion, including the use of biocidal compounds, which show low efficacy against biofilms and pose an environmental hazard due to their toxicity. Biofilms also lead to
    biofouling (the adherence of larger macroorganisms) which is detrimental to numerous industries, including transportation, oil industry, aquaculture, air conditioning, etc. Similar to the approaches taken to combat biocorrosion,
    antifouling approaches are dominated by copper, a toxic metal that harms the environment and is challenged by regulation. Research out of the University of Minnesota has developed an alternative solution to bypass these limitations. A
    key step in the formation of many biofilms is bacterial communication through molecules known as quorum signals. By incorporating enzymes engineered to break-down quorum signals into steel coatings, researchers were able to reduce
    biocorrosion by 50%.

    This technology is a noninvasive hearing multiplexing device that uses ultrasound signals to transmit audible sounds by exploiting cochlear regions that are under-utilized. The device, which is attached to the head/neck region, sends
    modulated ultrasonic signals to vibrate brain fluids. This vibration, in turn, produces audible sound signals in channels that are typically not used. As the signals are sent as vibrations through brain fluid, the airborne sound coming
    through the ear canal remains undisturbed. In other words, the device can be used to perform multiplexing with the cochlea to send desired sound signals in new perceptual channels without affecting normal hearing.
</p>
,
<p>
    Humans can hear sound signals in frequency ranging from 20Hz to 20kHz. However, some frequencies in this range are attenuated by the outer/middle ear (e.g., below 100Hz and above 8kHz). The technology described here uses modulated
    ultrasonic signals to enable hearing in those under-used frequencies. Multiple transmitters can be used to simultaneously stimulate different regions of the cochlea without distorting airborne sound. Such a technology can be utilized to
    send speech or other useful sound signals in a noisy environment, such as construction sites, war zone, or manufacturing facilities. This technology can be integrated with cell phones and other consumer products. This technology may
    also be used to develop new types of music production that combines normal sound along with ultrasound hearing. The device and accompanying algorithm can be optimized based on individual’s hearing preference and anatomy.

    to target nervous tissues with high spatial resolution (voxel size: &lt; 2 cubic mm). Using specific parameters, tFUS can reversibly modulate neural activity by non-invasively heating a spatially-restricted volume of neural tissue
    without histological damage. This technology has also been shown to have superior temporal and spatial resolution when compared to other neuromodulation platforms, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct
    current stimulation (tcDCS). \n<br />
    \nProfessor Emad Ebbini’s team has demonstrated suppression of somatosensory-evoked potentials using tFUS in rodents. Activity suppression is found to be highly correlated and temporally consistent with <i>in vivo</i> temperature
    changes. Noninvasive heating of spatially-restricted volume of neural tissue without damage may provide a method of temporarily suppressing specific neural pathways or controlling networks through multiple foci. This technology may also
    be useful in investigating the basis of disease and neural function. Focused thermal neuromodulation pairs a method of noninvasive investigation of the underlying locations and networks of diseases of the central nervous system with a
    monitored treatment platform.\n

    Due to its health benefits, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding infants for a minimum of one year, a goal that only 35% of babies in the US reach. A barrier to breastfeeding for many mothers is the difficulty in
    pumping milk, a practice commonly cited as inefficient, time-consuming and both physically and socially uncomfortable. This is in large part due to the currently commercially available breast pumps that stimulate milk production using
    suction. These pumps are noisy, require a user to partially disrobe and necessitates access to a power outlet; physically isolating women from carrying out tasks and fully participating in the work-place. Compounding the problem, these
    pumps poorly mimic infant’s stimulation of milk and many women report increased discomfort and decreased milk output, which adds to the challenges.
</p>
,
<p>
    A group of researchers at the University of Minnesota’s Medical Devices Center have come up with a solution to take the “suck” out of pumping, literally. They have developed a concealed, wearable breast pump that uses mechanical
    compression (instead of vacuum suction) and warmth to mimic infant stimulation for milk expression. The mechanical stimulation (which uses data-determined pressure and pattern specifications), is capable of increasing milk output and
    also allows the pump to operate quietly compared to vacuum driven pumps.The pump is also designed as a wearable device that can be concealed under clothing, facilitating a woman to pump discreetly while continuing to carry out tasks in
    the workplace or the home. This technology empowers mothers to more fully engage in their careers and daily lives while still prioritizing their baby by lessening the physical and opportunity costs associated with pumping milk.

    While wearables, such as FitBit and other activity trackers, are useful for tracking and recording user’s physical and sleep activities, annotation and effective interpretation of data requires expertise. Moreover, evaluation of
    longitudinal activity data is done only in retrospect. Recently, researchers at the University of Minnesota developed a data mining and machine learning approach to optimize a prediction framework, that anticipates sleep quality
    beforehand. By evaluating a person’s physical activities over time, the algorithm recommends a set of activities to improve the quality of the individual\'s sleep.
</p>
,
<p>
    Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for clinical sleep diagnosis, and requires multiple sensors to track brain activity, body movement, heart rate, breathing frequency, and O2 levels. While PSG provides high-fidelity data,
    accuracy can be low because patients are required to sleep in the hospital, missing the more accurate picture of a patient’s behavior in familiar settings. Wearables on the other hand, can track sleep and physical activities
    (actigraphy) around-the-clock in familiar settings. This recommender system was developed to evaluate actigraphy data of individuals using human activity recognition algorithms. After evaluation, the algorithm can identify behavioral
    patterns that lead to good or poor quality sleep. These patterns are then used as target behavior, to ensure a good night\'s sleep. This machine learning algorithm can be integrated with existing wearables to predict and recommend
    highly personalized behavioral changes to improve the individual’s quality of sleep.

    This medical device is a modular vaginal dilation and flushing device that helps improve patient compliance and prevent serious postoperative complications associated with vaginoplasty. Patient compliance is improved by reducing the
    number of painful dilation and douching procedures required during the 90-days post-op period. The device can be used for preventing both acute and chronic post-op complications, including risks of infection, necrosis due to uneven
    pressure, vaginal stenosis, and neovaginal prolapse.
</p>
,
<p>
    By exploiting a stent design, the device reduces severe complications caused by vaginal packing with lubricated gauze, and frequent insertion and removal of hard plastic dilators. This all-in-one modular device replaces lubricated
    gauze, plastic dilators, and the douching mechanisms that are commonly used in perioperative and postoperative period following a vaginoplasty procedure. The device is designed to simultaneously provide uniform radial support to the
    neovaginal cavity as well as facilitate douching procedures. The flexible stent layer and soft external layer reduces pain during dilation/cleaning procedures, thereby improving patient compliance and reducing the risk of tissue trauma,
    infection, skin slough or vaginal prolapse. Channels built in the device promote coating of douching fluid to the entire neovagina, providing a better clean than typical douching.

    This technology is a software based model for analyzing whole brain diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to estimate function specific brain circuits. The approach reveals
    detailed anatomical connectivity patterns for each functional module and recovers structural connections that are underestimated by diffusion MRI (dMRI). Using Human Connectome Project (HCP) data, the model successfully identified
    function specific anatomical circuits, such as the language and resting state networks.
</p>

<p>
    Traditionally, estimating brain circuits by incorporating information from functional MRI into diffusion MRI is challenging. Seed regions for tractography are selected from fMRI activation maps to extract the white matter pathways of
    interest. This new method jointly analyzes whole brain dMRI and fMRI data revealing detailed anatomical connectivity patterns for each functional module. This novel framework explicitly models interactions between structural and
    functional connectivity measures, thereby improving anatomical circuit estimation.

    Light-based neurotherapies are difficult to use in vivo. The currently accepted method of obtaining optical access to the brain is to excise a section of skull, implant a planar glass coverslip, and shine light through the cranial
    window. This method offers good resolution but a small field of view. It can also deform the brain and damage the underlying tissue, disrupting therapies and experiments. Other technologies (e.g., skull thinning, light emitting
    probes/optical probe insertion, and wavefront shaping) suffer from poor resolution, a small field of view, or both. This new technology is minimally invasive, has low surgical variability, reduces tissue damage and dramatically
    increases field of view. The three dimensional geometry of the implants allow excision of much larger sections of the skull allowing for access to a much wider region of the brain.

    This technology is a system for coordinated reset deep brain stimulation (CR DBS) which uses a segmented DBS array electrodes and short-term electrical pulses delivered in a fixed or varying sequence. This therapy uses multiple contacts
    in different locations of the target brain structure to offer flexibility to CR contact configuration and intensity selection. In some cases, this can also provide flexibility to cross structure CR configuration. In addition, a novel
    stimulation strategy delivers high stimulation intensity at the beginning of treatment, until optimal therapeutic improvement is achieved, and then reduces the stimulation to a low intensity to maintain the therapeutic effect.
    Directional CR DBS could be used to treat nervous system or multiple movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson\'s disease, essential tremor, dystonia, and other neurological and/or psychiatric conditions).
</p>
,
<p>
    Traditional isochronal DBS, while a successful treatment for Parkinson\'s disease, has not changed for decades. Constant high frequency stimulation from the traditional DBS drains the device battery within several years, requiring risky
    battery replacement surgeries. In addition, current spread related side effects limit its application and therapeutic window. Directional CR DBS combines new DBS lead technology and a novel strategy to produce a comparable—or even
    better—therapeutic effect than traditional DBS therapies and with fewer side effects. Because it uses a very low stimulation intensity (one third or less than traditional isochronal DBS), it significantly reduces battery consumption.

    This invention uses ultrasound to measure the nonlinear mechanical properties of an object including those of biological tissues. This information can be used to detect abnormalities in tissues. The technique combines the advantages of
    using acoustic radiation force (ARF) ultrasound for local tissue characterization and the capability of assessing the nonlinear tissue elasticity as an additional new modality for differential cancer diagnosis.
</p>
,
<p>
    At present, no techniques are capable of assessing nonlinear tissue elasticity locally via acoustic radiation force (ARF) ultrasound. ARF generated by modulated ultrasound is already used in a number of medical diagnostic techniques:
    Vibroacoustography, Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI), Supersonic Imaging, and Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging (ARFI). However, these techniques only diagnose the tissue locally by assessing its linear elastic parameters.
    Estimating a tissue’s nonlinear elastic parameters may elevate the differential diagnosis of cancerous lesions. This localization is especially important when imaging highly heterogeneous tissues as it allows the user to distinguish, in
    terms of linear and nonlinear tissue, between neighboring regions with high spatial resolution.

    Active knit compression garments dynamically apply compression to various areas of the body for medical, athletic and aerospace applications. The technology uses knitted garments that integrate shape memory alloy (SMA) wires trained
    through an annealing process to remember a straight or slightly curved form. When heated, the SMA wires return to those trained forms to cause the knit to contract, providing active compression. The knitted garments can wrap around the
    body in the form of leg sleeves, arm sleeves or body wraps. The garments give the wearer dynamic control by providing variable levels of functional compression, which is determined by the properties of the SMA, knit stitch type, size
    and structure and temperature of the SMA knit.

    A fast, simple and accurate quality control test can determine water quality where a very dilute level of contamination by pathogenic bacteria is suspected. The test uses a novel dielectrophoresis (DEP) step that concentrates and
    recovers a high fraction of bacteria. Then, inactivated free DNA from no-longer-viable bacteria allows nucleic acid amplification technology to measure DNA concentrations from only the pathogenic species. The DEP step improves bacterial
    recovery enough that smaller quantities of water can be used, and the unique nucleic acid primers identify specific genes of the live, pathogenic bacteria without also tagging other bacteria. This technology can be used for endoscope
    reprocessing quality testing: an area of particular concern due to the recent number of patient infections and deaths caused by cross-contamination of incompletely processed endoscopes.
</p>
,
<p>
    Monitoring water quality is important not only for municipal water suppliers but also in the medical field. In particular, measuring water quality of rinsate from medical instrumentation (e.g., endoscopes) can determine if a device has
    been cleaned adequately. A key requirement is the ability to detect small quantities of pathogens (i.e., as low as 1 CFU/mL of sample), and to do so quickly enough to determine if rinse water needs further treatment or medical devices
    need more cleaning. Current water tests that measure metabolic pathway components as a proxy for the presence of organisms are limited in that these markers are not specific to pathogens or viable bacteria, and the tests are not
    sensitive at the low levels required. Other tests that culture samples from water require a 12 to 48 hour incubation before producing results, too long a wait for many applications. This new test is fast, simple and accurate. It works
    with dilute levels of pathogenic bacterial contamination as well as with smaller water samples.

    A novel catheter system performs a targeted form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to provide blood to the heart and brain during cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock. The targeted
    cardio-cerebral ECMO (TC-ECMO) system is easy for average-trained, less specialized healthcare personnel to use, it provides time to transfer the patient to a higher level medical center (i.e., one with an ECMO team). The procedure
    supplies oxygenated blood to the portion of the aorta where the cerebral and coronary arteries originate. The system consists of an aortic catheter and a venous catheter (placed in the inferior vena cava) connected to an external,
    semi-automated oxygenator and pump that requires very minimal operator intervention while transporting the patient. The device is inserted via the femoral artery and vein and has two balloons that inflate; one blocks the descending
    aorta, and the other blocks the inferior vena cava. The device is expected to improve survival rate and neurological outcomes in cardiac arrest patients. It can also be used to support the circulation in patients undergoing high risk
    coronary artery interventions and in patients with cardiogenic shock.
</p>
,
<p>
    Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) chest compressions is associated with poor survival outcomes and high incidence of neurological deficits, mostly because it cannot provide sufficient amount of oxygenated blood to the vital organs
    (i.e. heart and brain). Combining CPR with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECPR) improves survival and neurological outcomes, however its use is limited to large hospitals that have specialized teams available around the clock.
    Another limitation is that ECMO uses very large arterial and venous cannulas that require special expertise for placement and may lead to high failure and complication rates. The TC-ECMO system overcomes many of these limitations and
    offers numerous benefits including:\nExclusively delivers oxygenated blood to the brain and heart\nEasier to place than ECMO; can be easily implemented in the emergency department, doesn’t require highly trained personnel\nProvides a
    temporizing measure to allow more cardiac arrest patients access to ECPR, hence saves more lives\nSmaller cannulas and fewer vascular complications\nExpected improvement in survival rate and neurological outcomes\nDelivers more blood to
    the brain than chest compression\nPortable: small external unit\nRequires minimal human intervention\nSuperior to regular ECMO in bleeding patients

    A novel ultrasound hearing aid noninvasively restores hearing by activating the auditory system of the brain. The technology uses ultrasound stimulation to create waves and vibrations in the brain fluids. These waves and vibrations
    vibrate cochlear fluids through the inner ear canal, which activates the auditory brain and induces hearing. The ultrasound can also vibrate cochlear fluids directly to induce hearing. The method bypasses all potentially damaged
    pathways (e.g., ear canal, eardrum, middle ear bones/ossicles, stapes-round window interface and/or cochlear malformations). The device uses modulated and burst patterns with low intensities (typically within the 100kHz to 1MHz range)

    Current localization coils often become dislodged due to lung movement during patient respiration. Other localization methods using guidewires or metal coils risk injuring patients with large or complex structures, such as hooks or
    barbs, at the site of the lung nodule. With this technology, the suture at the proximal end of a coil prevents the coil from dislodging from during the procedure. The design significantly simplifies deployment by reducing time and
    radiation exposure and increasing accuracy of localization.

    Coronary MRI still faces major challenges, including lengthy acquisition time, low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), and suboptimal spatial resolution. Higher spatial resolution in the sub-millimeter (sub-mm) range is desirable, but this
    results in increased acquisition time and lower SNR, hindering its clinical implementation.

    A new cancer-fighting technology uses non-invasive local hyperthermia to kill metastasizing breast cancer cells. The approach builds upon existing poly(ε-caprolactone) scaffolds that recruit and trap metastasizing breast cancer cells in
    vivo. An electrically conductive/semi-conductive metal disk placed in the center of the porous polymer scaffold can generate enough heat to kill cancer cells attached to the disk. The heat is generated through electromagnetic induction
    by an oscillating magnetic field within a radiofrequency coil. Tumor cells are recruited to the scaffold by immune cells, and wound healing after thermal therapy creates an inflammatory environment that may facilitate future recruitment
    of tumor cells. This ability to noninvasively thermally ablate captured cells using biomaterial scaffolds could potentially extend focal thermal therapies to disseminated cancers.
</p>

    Breast cancer is a leading cause of death for women worldwide, usually due to metastasis of the primary tumor to vital organs such as the lung, liver and brain. Currently, few therapeutic options exist for metastatic disease, as cancer
    metastasis typically remains undetected until it is very advanced and often incurable. While focal therapies such as local application of heat have been successfully applied to solid tumors, this novel approach applies non-invasive
    local hyperthermia to disseminating tumor cells. Scaffolds have recently been shown to recruit metastasizing breast cancer cells very early in disease progression, and their capture reduces tumor burden at other sites and improves
    survival. This new technology enhances the therapeutic potential of this approach by combining it with focal therapy (thermal, cryo, or electrical) to destroy the captured tumor cells.

    A new technology localizes the origins of cardiac arrhythmia via clinically available 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) enhanced by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a realistic computer heart model. After registering the cardiac
    model with individual patient’s heart, training datasets are generated and the origin(s) of focal cardiac arrhythmias are localized. ECG data is fed into one or more CNNs (one CNN classifies atrial applications; two CNNs classify
    ventricular sources). The applicable CNN identifies the segment of the heart where the arrhythmia originated and whether it has an epicardial or endocardial focus. This novel technology can not only map premature ventricular contraction
    (PVC) in patients, but may apply to other cardiac disorders (e.g., ventricular tachycardia and atrial arrhythmias). It may provide real-time monitoring and localization of cardiac arrhythmias origins which can be used to guide ablation
    treatment.
</p>

<p>
    Advanced imaging methods currently used for cardiac navigation (i.e., for ablation to treat atrial fibrillation) use algorithms to translate positioning data from a cardiac catheter into a 3D image. Pace mapping, a commonly used
    technique for localizing an ablation site, is invasive and may even damage healthy tissue. This new, non-invasive approach uses only 12-lead ECG, making it broadly applicable without additional hardware. CNN expedites localization and
    achieves accuracy comparable to those requiring high density body surface mapping.

    A double-walled aortic stent graft is compliant to luminal pressure in the aorta. The outer layer of this new design is rigid, similar to current stent grafts, and the inner layer is comprised of a compliant, flexible material that
    exhibits elastic properties similar to a healthy aorta. The space between the inner and outer layers can be filled (i.e., with sterile saline) to create a volume buffer between the layers so the stent graft becomes compliant to luminal
    pressure. When blood flows through the lumen of the inner layer, the flexible walls can deform in a similar manner of a healthy vessel. This technology could decrease pressure-induced stresses on the residual native aorta, reduce risk
    of Stent graft Induced New Entry (SINE) dissections, and potentially result in better systemic hypertension management dissections.
</p>
,
<p>
    Existing aortic endografts offer some flexibility along their length but are rigid across their diameters. Because they press outward against the aortic wall and do expand during systole, they require greater energy from the native
    aorta to dissipate the systolic pressure wave. While these stent grafts may protect an acutely injured aorta from an aneurysm, they could also damage the native aorta and require aggressive blood pressure management. This new
    double-walled, compliant design provides flexibility across the stent graft diameter. When the flexible wall of the inner layer deforms, it behaves more like a healthy vessel. Increasing the compliance can improve peak systolic pressure
    and lead to better patient outcomes.

    A novel referenceless technique corrects magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images by removing Nyquist ghost artifacts from echo planar imaging (EPI). The algorithm seeks to find a set of optimal phase correction parameters that minimize
    a metric calculated directly from uncorrected images. The metric is defined as the sum of the ratio between the image and an image shifted by half of the field of view (FOV). The method is effective for not only single shot EPI, but
    also for multi-shot EPI, where current methods require a reference scan, navigators or user intervention.
</p>

<p>
    Echo planar imaging (EPI), used for fast imaging on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, is prone to an artifact known as a Nyquist ghost. While existing methods can offer Nyquist ghost correction, they often fail in body imaging
    due to insufficient fat suppression. This technology offers a unique Nyquist ghost correction method with better performance, increased robustness and reduced acquisition requirements compared to existing methods.

    The ThermoDome thermodilution cardiac output catheter significantly shortens the distance needed to measure cardiac output. Its unique design features multiple laser drilled holes at the distal end of the catheter. These holes create a

        While thermodilution has been used to measure cardiac output for years, it is too inaccurate during low flow states (e.g., times of advanced circulatory support such as ECMO, and significant tricuspid/valvular regurgitation back
        into the atrium). This new catheter and thermocouple design addresses these issues by reducing/eliminating effects of significant tricuspid regurgitation, accurately measuring cardiac output when parallel circuits are present,
        evaluating cardiac output during percutaneous pulmonic valve implantation and accurately measuring shunt fractions, particularly right to left shunts.

    A new vascular graft design may diagnose endoleaks without requiring CT scans or angiography. The technology monitors changes in arterial pressure that may indicate an endoleak. Specifically, the technology coats existing PTFE or Dacron
    vascular grafts in carbon nanotubes or silver nanoparticles to create a pressure-sensitive membrane. When the sleeves deform due to pressure changes, an electrical signal is created. The signals are transmitted via radiofrequency to a
    receiver outside of the body. The receiver displays real-time pressure readouts and wall shear stress of both the internal and external surface of the graft. Radiopaque markers provide fluoroscopic visual confirmation of the graft’s
    orientation, so the physician can reliably identify the areas of the graft under excessive stress or exhibiting signs of endoleaks.
</p>
,
<p>
    Current vascular grafts eliminate flow to an aneurysmal space, thereby reducing or eliminating the risk of rupture. However, when a vascular graft fails to completely divert blood flow, an endoleak may result. Endoleaks are difficult to
    diagnose, and current graft technologies have no way to monitor endoleads or provide feedback. This new technology provides real-time, active sensing of the vascular graft which may be used to diagnose endoleaks. The graft produces a
    three-dimensional pressure map that spatially localizes differentiations in pressure measurements to assist physicians in localizing graft defects.

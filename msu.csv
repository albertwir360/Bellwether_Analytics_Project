Surface TSPO in blood cells: Biomarker of peripheral and brain inflammation,Translocator Protein 18kDa TSPO is a nuclear encoded outer mitochondrial membrane protein that is ubiquitously expressed by most host cells. Initially TSPO was a diazepam target but it has also been referred to as an orphan protein searching for a function . Since the generation of these knockouts TSPO has been determined essential in steroidogenesis as well as proliferation apoptosis reactive oxygen species generation cell differentiation immune modulation and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. Although there has been this increase in knowledge of TSPO there is a lack of evidence of the clear molecular function of TSPO. TSPO is currently used in autoradiography and immunohistochemical methods to allow for robust visualization and correlation of TSPO in glial cells and infiltrating monocytes in the brains of living humans who are experiencing inflammatory mediated brain diseases making TSPO an extremely attractive biomarker of neuroinflammation and a potential druggable target. No previous studies have directly interrogated the connection between peripheral immune cell TSPO surface expression and neuroinflammation. These inventors are the first to describe TSPO expression in the peripheral immune cell populations and the correlation to neuroinflammation. This invention is using TSPO as an immune specific biomarker for inflammatory immune cell activation in the periphery. The inventors are able to detect TSPO through flow cytometry and determine that TSPO is detectable on several immune cell types on the cell surface. They have detected an increase in TSPO expression on the cell surface of monocytes using both LPS treatment and blood from HIV patients. Therefore these inventors have found a novel connection between TSPO expression and neuroinflammation in the periphery.

Genetic Engineering of Oils In Vegetable (Non-Seed) Tissues By Diverting Carbon From Starch,Triacylglycerol TAG is an ester that is derived from three fatty acids and glycerol. Triglycerides are the main constituents vegetable oil. Generally in an oil crop species TAG is produced in seeds and this TAG can be harvested for various uses. TAG from plant oils are used as feedstocks for biofuels food and industrial chemicals. Crops may also be engineered to produce oils in non seed tissues. The embryos seeds in plants have an active pathway of storage oil biosynthesis. WRINKLED1 is a transcription factor of Arabidopsis that regulates the conversion of sugar into fatty acid biosynthesis within these seeds. This pathway can be activated in non seed tissues to increase oil production. This technology optimizes the use of synthetic biology to produce oil in non seed tissues such as leaves and shoots in transgenic plants in order to increase the conversion of sugars into oil. Through the use of an RNAi to knock down AGPase and thereby block starch biosynthesis together with expression of the WRI1 transcription factor under the control of a sugar sensitive promoter PATATIN B33 the inventors were able to activate TAG biosynthesis in vegetative tissues. Total fatty acid levels in vegetative tissues are increased 2 3 fold by shifting carbon partitioning from starch to precursors of fatty acid biosynthesis. US patents issued 9 657 304 and 10 280 432 
Evolution Of Models To Predict Protein Function Using Genetic Programming,Genetic Programming GP follows the concept put forth by Darwin Survival of the Fittest . Species that evolve and adapt in response to the environment are more likely to survive. GP evolves models that can optimize peptides and proteins for variety of applications. It requires only basic understanding in protein engineering. The output can be a peptide or a protein that has improved function and yet has a sequence that is significantly different from the original sequence. One application is to optimize peptides that can be visualized by magnetic resonance imaging MRI . Specifically the chemical exchange saturation transfer CEST contrast produced by a given protein s amino acid sequence can be optimized through the use of variables operators and functions to solve and optimize a problem. Sequence pattern tables are used to represent the GP model. The sequence pattern tables are weighted in importance of that pattern in order to achieve a better CEST contrast. For this technology CEST is used to determine efficacy of the protein. Depending on the protein of interest other methods to test efficacy will be used. Translation tables are used to translate amino acid letters into a value which describes a property of that amino acid which allows the GP to explore different search dimensions. This invention is the development of the Protein Optimization Engineering Tool POET which optimizes protein function using Genetic Programming. POET evolves models that can predict protein functions from their sequence and can optimize proteins by predicting potential peptides with regard to special functions. These peptides can be tested experimentally to determine accuracy and added to the training dataset to evolve more accurate models for future experiments.

"New Compounds to Treat, Detect and Prevent Congenital Heart Disease",Congenital heart defects CHD are the most common type of congenital defects in humans. It affects 1 of infants born each year. CHD can be caused by environmental exposures as well as having a genetic component to the disease. Studies have shown 400 genes that are associated with CHD. However 60 of the time the cause for these defects is unknown. During embryogenesis the heart will be one of the first to form. Through Bmp Fgf and Wnt signaling the mesoderm will generate a heart tube followed by looping of the tube to form ventricles atria aortic and pulmonary arteries. If any portion of this signaling is disrupted it can result in CHD. These inventors assessed the embryos of pregnant mice depleted of all essential fatty acids EFA . The embryos in the EFA deficient group had normal weight and gross morphology but a slight developmental delay. When the hearts were histologically analyzed it revealed several grave defects associated with CHD not present in control animals. The inventor then rescued this effect with DHA supplementation. The inventor s preliminary data suggests that DHA lipoxygenase derived oxylipin formation is key in cardiovascular development. This invention proposes the supplementation of DHA during pregnancy to prevent congenital heart defects. This is a novel intervention aimed at preventing CHD. The inventor also believes it provides a basis for future treatments to ameliorate symptoms of CHD. Provisional Patent 
Biosynthesis of Chemically Diversified Non-Natural Terpene Products,Drug and chemical discovery is a lengthy difficult and inefficient process. The production of new drugs and chemicals is bottlenecked at synthesis or biosynthesis of complicated molecules especially chiral molecules. Furthermore diversification of current drug and chemical libraries is hindered by these difficult and inefficient synthetic processes. This technology diversifies and produces new terpene drugs and chemicals. This technology is composed of three parts i novel non natural enzyme substrates ii diterpene synthases that convert these substrates to intermediate scaffolds and iii the novel scaffolds. A diverse range of new intermediates scaffolds was made by introducing unnatural substrate molecules to a diverse panel of substrate agnostic class I and II diterpene synthases. These scaffolds would otherwise be impossible to synthesize using typical chemical methods or through biosynthesis with natural substrate molecules. These scaffolds can be functionalized to make new or diverse drugs fragrances agrochemicals antibacterial chemicals etc. The diterpene synthases efficiently process the new substrates into new intermediate scaffolds. The pairing of both the novel unnatural substrate molecules and the substrate agnostic enzymes widens the scope in drug diversification and discovery and provides a biosynthetic library for activity screening.

Transcription factors to improve plant resistance to insects,As sessile organisms plants must be able to adapt swiftly to biotic and environmental stimuli and often do this through transcriptional reprogramming. Upon wounding by a ravenous insect for instance jasmonic acid JA increases in concentration within a cell and interacts with members of the JAZ family of repressor proteins. Ultimately JA response genes will be activated and direct plant resources towards defense. Attempts to keep these defense signals on however are met with many hurdles including strong growth repression resulting in stunted or small plants. MSU researchers have addressed these issues through a gene editing or genetically engineering approach delivering a phenotype of Relief of Repression where a plant s defense system is turned on and the plant displays normal growth.This MSU technology describes bioengineered plants plant cells and seeds with improved resistance to environmental stresses such as drought and insects. The modified genes help not only against pests but can also allow increased production of plant derived medicinal compounds promoted by the JA pathway. This invention is a set of modified MYC transcription factors. When expressed in plants the proteins act in a dominant fashion to activate the JA signaling pathway leading to enhanced insect resistance. A second gene phyB is knocked out to avoid growth repression caused by over expression of the JA response. The resulting plants exhibit superior defense and normal growth simultaneously.

Method for Improved Production of Terpenoids Using Co-Engineered Lipid Droplets and Anchoring of Terpene Biosynthetic Enzymes on Their Surface,This technology addresses one of the main hurdles of plant production and extraction of terpenoids by capturing desired terpenes in lipid droplets in plant cells. The lipid droplets are readily extracted using standard processes used in the vegetable oil and biodiesel industries and the high value terpenes can be easily separated from the lipids. The limited economic sustainability of formal petro chemical synthesis and extraction and purification from the native plant source has motivated biotechnological approaches to produce industrially relevant terpenoids. This technology improves both terpene accumulation and ease of purification representing a significant improvement on current production methods in plants. Plant derived terpenoids have a wide range of industrial uses such as specialty fuels agrochemicals fragrances nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. Production of terpenoids in plants faces difficulties both in overall yield and in clean extraction of the desired compound from the plant. Anchoring terpene production to cytosolic lipid droplets overcomes both of these problems. The lipid droplet containing the desired terpene removes potentially toxic compounds from the cellular environment allowing the compound to accumulate without harming the plant or activating negative feedback loops. Moreover concentration of the terpenoid in lipid droplets allows for a simplified vegetable oil based extraction process. Use of a previously patented MSU technology TEC2000 0092 and TEC2015 0075 enables increased accumulation of triacylglycerols promoting droplet production. This is expressed along with a lipid droplet surface protein and diterpenoid biosynthetic enzymes modified to anchor on the lipid droplets. Diterpenoids naturally partition into the lipid droplets thus trapping the terpenoids and facilitating extraction. Multi enzyme complexes on NoLDSP allow for high productivity of terpenoids with modified functional groupsSequestering of terpenoid products in lipid droplets reduces negative feedback and toxicity to cells caused by high levels of terpenoid synthesisIncreased economic value of high biomass yielding crops with dual products of biofuel oil form lipid droplets and terpenes Easier harvest of products compared to extractions from resins or small structures like trichomes Production of alternate fuels and terpenoid co productsPotential impact on the following markets Biofuel Pharmaceutical Cosmetics Food Industry Agricultural ChemicalsPossible development in yeast and other oleaginous fungi United States provisional patent application filed August 2018Full rights available for TEC209 0153.

Method for Production of Novel Diterpene Scaffolds,Many insecticides currently in use are problematic due to persistence in the environment and off target effects including accumulation in apex predator species. Therefore effective crop protecting agents that are naturally sourced and that overcome some of these side effects are under increasing demand. This technology identifies biosynthetic pathways towards a number of plant derived chemicals with documented insect antifeedant activities. Diterpenes are 20 carbon molecules derived from 4 isoprene subunits. Clerodane diterpenes in particular have attracted interest in recent years due to their notable biological activities as insecticides and repellants. Diverse diterpene skeletons can be created through the action of interchangeable diterpene synthases classified as Class II acting on the universal diterpene substrate GGPP and Class I acting on the Class II product . This technology identifies several Class II and Class I enzymes from the plant family Lamiaceae a rich source of diterpene synthases. These provide access to novel clerodane type diterpene skeletons with documented insect antifeedant activities as well as creating a platform for discovery of additional related compounds. These diterpenes may also be useful as flavorings or fragrances. Synthesis of many of these compounds has been demonstrated through transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana.

Two Phase Consortium for Production of Metabolites from a Cyanobacteria/Bacteria Mixed Consortium,Biobased plastics and chemicals offer an alternative solution to products traditionally made from fossil fuel sources. Bioindustries utilize heterotrophic organisms to convert carbohydrate rich feedstocks like sugarcane sugar beets and corn into value added compounds e.g. nutritional supplements pharmaceuticals etc. . Because these feedstocks often require premium land water and costly transportation industry has looked for alternatives to food crop derived sugars. Cyanobacterial autotrophic fermentation systems are regarded as the most efficient platform and most promising route for production of carbon substrates such as oils and sugars but are hindered with separation and cell density issues that limit cost effectiveness. Cyanobacteria are also limited in the products that they may produce. MSU researchers have developed a technology to mitigate many of the costs and limitations with a one pot reaction of co existing microbes that convert cyanobacterial derived sucrose into higher value compounds and the production organisms are reusable after each harvest.This MSU technology is a flexible autotroph heterotroph consortia platform for the creation of valuable biological metabolites from solar energy. The synthetic co culture utilizes a modular design in which cyanobacteria are contained in hydrogel beads. The cyanobacteria fix atmospheric CO2 and secret sucrose. The engineered strain of cyanobacteria exports up to 85 of the sucrose it makes and its sucrose production rate exceeds that of sugarcane. The second organism is a heterotroph e.g. E. coli B. subtilis or S. cervisiae that uses the sucrose to form an end product like polyhydroxybuturate PHB or an industrial enzyme. The use of cyanobacteria eliminates the need for any external carbohydrate feedstocks and the novel hydrogel bead technology allows easy separation and re use of the cyanobacteria after each harvest greatly reducing costs. The media and growth conditions have also been optimized to allow the co cultures to persist over an extended time.Flexible modular platform allows variety of end products tailored to specific needCo cultures stable over time up to months No external carbohydrate feedstock necessaryConsistent and continuous production 4x more productive 20x faster than cyanobacteria alone Novel hydrogel bead technology allows for easy end product extraction and re use of cultureInexpensive to maintain Synthetic cross feeding consortia for photoproduction of Biochemicals metabolites and industrial enzymesPigments vitamins etc. United States patent application pendingFull licensing rights available Taylor Weiss Eric YoungTEC2018 0024
Stabilization and Upgrading of Bio-Oil Using Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation,Pyrolyzing biomass into bio oil is one option to convert biomass into a useable easily transported form with minimal inputs. However pyrolysis derived bio oil contains hundreds of reactive organic compounds that are corrosive to container materials and prone to polymerization. Therefore it is necessary to be able to rapidly convert this bio oil on site into a more stable form that can be transported and refined using metal containers and pipes.This technology rapidly converts fast pyrolysis derived bio oil into a more stable form of bio oil that can be transported using existing metal infrastructure. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation converts reactive compounds into more stable reduced forms with increased hydrogen content and reduced reactivity. Hydrogen is produced by the cathode so there is no need for external hydrogen gas. A solid supported metal catalyst that is resistant to corrosion is used under mild conditions which reduces carbon loss and increases the lifetime of the catalyst. The method allows low cost metal catalysts to be used to increase the value of the bio oil product. Robust Catalyst a self assembled catalyst supported on a metal grid or carbon maintains activity via dynamic dissolution and redeposition and operates for many hours with no physical degradation or activity loss. Mild Conditions Atmospheric pressure and low temperature reactions minimizes undesired reactions and improves safety More energy dense product Bio oil product has more reduced compounds than the input which increases specific energy. Stable product The treated bio oil product is less reactive and does not corrode metal or polymerize. Minimal requirements The only input is electricity which means this can be run anywhere with access to the energy grid before transportation to biorefineries.

Small Molecule Inhibitors For The Treatment Of Proteinopathies,Protein aggregation that leads to plaque formation is a contributor in many degenerative diseases including Alzheimer s Parkinson s Type 2 diabetes and other amyloidosis diseases. Once these plaques are formed they are extremely difficult to degrade. Breakdown and even inhibition of oligomers before formation of these plaques is an important step in pre disease treatments. A therapeutic is needed that can target the specific proteins involved in aggregation for each of these diseases and inhibit oligomer formation slowing the progression of the disease and making life more comfortable and fulfilling for the patient. Furthermore drugs that can act on plaque formations and degrade them alongside oligomer inhibition would be a powerful tool to stop the progression of degenerative diseases.This technology uses small molecules to inhibit oligomer formation and even breakdown mature fibrils of plaques. The compounds bind to the protein involved in aggregation and stabilizes it in its monomeric form to inhibit aggregation. This technology involves several groups of compounds that are shown to be specific for single degenerative disease and also have broad spectrum inhibitory activity against multiple diseases such as Alzheimer s and Type 2 diabetes disease. In addition these compounds work with other pre disease measures to slow the progression of degenerative diseases. None 
Tunable Luminescent Organic Salts for Enhanced Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy,Theranostic nanomedicine the medical application of nanobiotechnology is an emerging area of cancer research. These nanosystems are capable of diagnosing curing or preventing diseases. One example of theranostic nanomedicine is photodynamic therapy which uses photosensitizing agents with light to kill cancer cells. However a major problem with this therapy is the toxic reactive oxygen species generated. Most photosensitizing agents developed are focused on chemical modification of fluorescent probes which produce high energy levels leading to off target phototoxicity. MSU researchers have addressed this drawback by generating tunable fluorescent probes which couple fluorescent cations with various non fluorescent anions. Depending on the anion coupled these tunable fluorescent probes can enable brighter medical imaging enhance image guided surgery improve fluorescent labeling for biomedical research and provide selective photodynamic therapy without side effects. This MSU technology is a method of using various organic salts for enhanced imaging and photodynamic therapy. Paired anions have optoelectronic control which allows them to be tuned for phototoxicity or non toxic imaging. As a result these new tunable fluorescent probes will be superior to the current fluorescent dyes because they will not generate unwarranted toxicity.

Flexible ECoG Electrode Array,Scaling ECoG arrays to whole brain arrays or higher channel count with an intracranial chip is an area of active research crucial to brain machine interfaces that may define future technological advances. One barrier to scaling ECoG recording systems to high channel count more precise and localized data is the need for DC offset voltage reduction. A common method of eliminating DC offset is through coupling capacitors which allow only the AC signal through. However coupling capacitors require large surface area more than double the surface area of the electrode itself which greatly limits the size of the ECoG recording system.This design of a novel ECoG array has capacitors embedded directly into the electrode. This method allows full DC offset with a very small footprint. These electrodes can be used to make a very flexible electrode array that can wrap around the brain surface while minimizing chip size and external wires useful for brain machine interface technology. Smaller footprint The smaller chip enables the chip to be placed inside the skull for permanent or long term applications. Flexible The smaller chip allows it to be integrated into the electrode array while still maintaining maximal brain contact.

Immunomodulation Strategy for Enhancing Memory T Lymphocyte Immune Responses,Cytotoxic T cells T cells are a type of immune cell that provide immunological protection by destroying cells that are perceived as abnormal. T cell exhaustion or inhibition is often observed in patients with chronic viral infections or cancer resulting in a decreased ability of the patient to overcome such diseases. One strategy to enhance T cell responsiveness is to target inhibitory signaling pathways such as the recently FDA approved PD 1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. This strategy has been shown to effectively reverse T cell exhaustion inhibition and provides a tactic to boost patient resistance. In addition studies have also shown that targeting T cell inhibitory pathways concurrent with vaccination may also enhance the efficacy of prophylactic vaccines demonstrating several broad applications for T cell immunomodulators. Similar to that of PD 1 activation of CRACC receptors dampens T cell mediated immune responses. CRACC Fc is a novel immunomodulator capable of enhancing T cell mediated immune responses by preventing inhibitory effects of CRACC activation on T cells. This inhibitory protein may be administered as a therapeutic to enhance T cell immune responses or may be co administered co expressed with an antigen to boost T cell responses for prophylactic vaccines. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that T cell proliferation and the production of antigen specific cytokines are enhanced in CRACC Fc treated mice indicating an overall increase in T cell responsiveness. Although current work has been focused on the effects of the inhibitory protein on T cell responses the CRACC receptor is expressed in multiple innate and adaptive immune cells DCs macrophages NK cells B cells and it is possible that CRACC inhibition modulates the function of these immune cells as well collectively resulting in enhanced immune response.Patent application published publication number TEC2014 0105Full licensing rights availableSu Jun Lim Technology Manager email phone 517 884 1828 
Pre-Treatment Method for Metals Determination in Aqueous Samples,Practical detection of heavy metals in aqueous samples is a challenge for many testing and monitoring stations around the world. Heavy metal poisoning is the cause of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Specifically metals including lead arsenic cadmium and mercury have a direct impact on global health and are listed as four of the World Health Organization s WHO Ten Chemicals of Major Concern due to their carcinogenic and toxic effect. Typically blood samples are collected at a physician s office or a local diagnostic center and sent to an external lab for analysis. The blood samples are then processed using microwave assisted digestion MAD or acid digestion with heat to break down all organic material in the blood and leave behind the metal ions. Acid digestion with heat is less expensive but requires long processing time. Standard microwave digestion systems are costly but faster. Both pretreatment methods require a substantial sample volume for analysis. The market is open for a quick turnaround reliable low sample volume pretreatment and processing unit for blood samples to measure specific heavy metals such as lead. This technology is a method of pretreatment for biological and other applicable samples for heavy metal detection. The pretreatment method increases digestion efficiency and decreases sample turnaround. The method uses electrochemical advanced oxidation processes EAOPs with proprietary electrodes to breakdown organic material in samples allowing for metal ions to be free in solution. After pretreatment detection can be achieved for example using ICP MS GF AAS or electroanalytical methods such as anodic or cathodic stripping voltammetry ASV CSV . It is important to note that the disclosed procedure can be adapted to any aqueous sample whether it be environmental or biological.Faster than acid digestion with heat method of pretreatment and less expensive than microwave assisted digestion.Recyclable and Reusable materials for separation process.

Improving Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of DFMO,For many years the drug difluoromethylornithine DFMO has been shown to display chemopreventive and therapeutic properties with recent successes in the treatment of patients with high risk neuroblastoma NB and colorectal cancer. In a non cancer setting this FDA approved drug cures 95 of patients with West African sleeping sickness trypanosomiasis and is the preferred front line treatment introduced by the World Health Organization WHO . DFMO has also entered clinical trials for the prevention of Alzheimer s disease. Unfortunately in spite of its effectiveness extremely high oral doses of DFMO are required to achieve a sustained pharmacological effect in humans. While not overly toxic the gram quantities per day needed to treat patients limits the potential of the drug and lead to substantial therapy costs. MSU researchers have addressed this drawback with a new combination drug therapy which ultimately lowers the required quantities required for the same therapeutic benefit.This MSU technology is a method of treatment for ODC or polyamine dependent diseases like cancer parasitic diseases and Alzheimer s disease by pairing DFMO with select FDA approved additives to improve the retention of DFMO in the blood and extend the life of the drug in patients. As a result the new combination drug would be far superior to the treatment with DFMO alone because it reduces the need to administer DFMO at very high and frequent doses while sustaining a constant drug level that is required in neuroblastoma patients making an effective drug even better.Minimal side effect treatmentIncreased retention of DFMO within body keeping a constant effective dose in the blood for a longer timeLower dosage amount and frequency taken requiredDecreased therapy costs Drug treatment regimen for high risk Neuroblastoma other ODC related cancers West African Sleeping Sickness Alzheimer s and Polyamine Associated Syndrome Under reviewFull licensing rights available Thomas C.

System for Identifying Brain Functional Area,Magnetic Resonance Imaging or MRI has revolutionized non invasive diagnostic methods used in modern medicine. Furthermore functional MRI fMRI has allowed researchers and technicians to observe neuron activity directly by monitoring blood oxygen levels within small areas of the brain. However steady states of activity must be established prior to analysis and even then noise of typical physiological functions can contribute to significant error in fMRI analysis. This technology is a novel statistical analysis of neuronal activity that determines areas of the brain that show highly correlated neuron function.This MSU developed method allows for superior modeling and analysis of neuronal function within the brain using fMRI. The technique analyzes neuronal activity to compare voxels of neurons to one another. This method identifies correlated neuronal activity that we call Functional Core Areas FCA . FCAs are an area of collective neural activity with uniform variation. These FCAs help distinguish correlated neuron function in all brain activity states without requiring measuring the brain while performing specific tasks.

Prediction of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Expansion using Bayesian Calibration,Ensuring that surgeries for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms AAA are performed at the appropriate time is important to reduce the high mortality rates associated with this serious disease. During the past decade a computational platform called a Growth Remodeling G R model has been developed to aid in this process. MSU researchers have invented a method for calibrating the parameters that determine the behavior of the G R model significantly enhancing its practical usefulness. The novel MSU technology employs detailed information based on patient specific calibration and provides a more accurate patient specific indicator of AAA rupture potential to assist in making crucial medical decisions.The G R model takes biological processes into account modeling each of the multiple constituents within artery walls elastin collagen and smooth muscle individually. The wall stress is used as feedback in order to simulate the real biological processes that affect the development of each of these constituents providing a more realistic model. Bayesian Calibration adjusts the G R model to the patient by incorporating patient specific data including but not limited to past and current medical images patient health history age and gender. Various uncertainties are also incorporated into the prediction. This results in a more accurate and robust predictor of patient risk for AAA rupture which aids clinicians and patients in the decision making process.More accurate and robust predictor of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm rupture potentialMethod for calibrating the parameters that determine the behavior of the G R modelValuable asset to both clinicians and patients Medical treatment of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Copyright materialFull licensing rights available Justin Mrkva Liangliang Zhang Chae Young Lim Tapabrata Maiti TEC2015 0005
Degradable Unimolecular Nanoparticles,Biodegradable polymers are useful as drug delivery agents. MSU researchers have developed a poly glycolide based polymer that forms unimolecular micelles with diameters less than 50 nm. These nanoparticles contain functional groups which provide anchoring sites for drugs contrast agents or other biological agents.Biodegradable polymers such as polylactic acid or poly glycolide are useful for various biomedical applications as they are biodegradable biocompatible and bioresorbable. However they lack appropriate functional groups which limits their utility in some applications. This technology provides a new biodegradable nanoparticle based on a poly glycolide polymer. The polymer is a scaffold with functional groups along the backbone which are reactive sites for click chemistry which provide sites for anchoring drugs or other biological agents or groups that act as contrasting agents for NMR imaging.The polymers form unimolecular micelles of less than 50 nm in diameter and in some cases less than 15 nm making them small enough to cross the blood brain barrier. The technology provides for crosslinking of the particles for enhanced dimensional stability.

Novel Rexinoid Agonists for Kras-mediated cancer and immunotherapy,KRAS is one of the most common oncogenes that when mutated causes normal cells to become cancerous. Current therapeutics designed to block KRAS function have not shown favorable clinical outcomes and therefore KRAS has been deemed an undruggable target. However our studies demonstrate that novel appropriately substituted rexinoids are highly effective in clinically relevant experimental models of lung and pancreatic cancers driven by KRAS mutations. A currently approved rexinoid bexarotene is an agonist for the Retinoid X receptor RXR which leads to arrest of cell proliferation. Despite promising results in lung cancer trials bexarotene failed to meet the desired clinical efficacy endpoints as a single agent and unwanted toxicity was observed. Therefore novel RXR agonists with increased efficacy and safety are desirable. MSU researchers have identified novel rexinoids for the purpose of treating multiple cancers including those with KRAS mutations and provide favorable outcomes in standard of care combination studies with both chemotherapies and PD 1 or PD L1 immunotherapies.Our researchers have developed novel rexinoids for treatment of the undruggable cancers caused by a KRAS mutation. These rexinoids show increased efficacy and safety and novel immunomodulatory activity not observed with the current FDA approved treatment bexarotene. Additionally these compounds show a 3 fold increase in binding affinity for the RXR receptor. Our researchers have also elucidated a novel mechanism of rexinoids on immune cells resulting in a decrease in tumor promoting macrophages decrease in tumor promoting myeloid derived suppressor cells and an increase in cytotoxic CD8 T cells. As a result these new rexinoid analogs enhance efficacy in relevant lung and pancreatic cancer models when combined with standard of care chemotherapy or immunotherapy targeting PD 1 and PD L1.

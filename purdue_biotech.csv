A Lab-on-Chip Platform for Measuring Real-time Nondestructive Extracellular Matrix Stiffness,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method of in vitro measurement of extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness that is nondestructive and provides fast readout. ECM stiffness has recently been found to be a contributing factor in cancer or fibrotic disease development including cell differentiation and rapid cell multiplication. Current technologies used to measure ECM stiffness in vitro are often invasive and expensive as well as sometimes limited to detecting cell destruction only after detrimental cell deformations have already occurred. The approach fine-tuned by Purdue researchers is includes a noninvasive on-chip platform that monitors ultrasonic wave attenuation thereby noninvasively characterizing ECM stiffness with up to 93% accuracy. The new low-cost sensors can continuously detect dynamic changes in vitro for up to two days while maintaining thermal stability. The highly selective, biocompatible sensors can also be implemented in applications including drug screening, drug discovery, and 3D cell cultures.   Advantages:-Low cost -Nondestructive -Accurate -Thermal Stability -Mechanical StabilityPotential Applications:-Biomedical -Research -3D Cell Cultures -Drug Screening -Therapeutic Efficacy Monitoring Recent Publication:  A Lab-on-Chip Ultrasonic Platform for Real-Time and Nondestructive Assessment of Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Royal Society of Chemistry's Lab on a Chip Journal  DOI: 10.1039/C9LC00926D"
Thermally Activated Ultrasound Contrast Agents,"Researchers at Purdue University have created a new thermally activated ultrasound contrast agent composed of nanodroplets. Unlike current technologies, the contrast agent solution lasts in the body for days if not up to months. This advantage greatly enhances patient care by eliminating need for repeated use of contrast agents. Another problem with traditional typical gas-filled solutions is product loss, as heat in the body can pop the gas bubbles. The agent created by Purdue researchers is activated by heating it outside the body to ensure that it remains stable. In addition, nanodroplets in the new contrast agent can reach as far as endothelial cells for enhanced imaging, whereas traditional agents have not been able to produce high-resolution images. These nanodroplets can be labeled for a variety of biomedical applications, as well, including tumor detection and tracking cells.Advantages:-Stable-Long Lasting -Heat Activated -Easy to LabelPotential Applications:-Ultrasound Imaging -Drug Delivery -Tumor Detection -Tracking Cells"
High Throughput Cancer Treatment Screening with Magnetic Actuation Platform,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a biomimetic platform using magnetic actuators for in vitro cell seeding. The setup is compatible with multi-well plates and allows for high throughput, thereby reducing the time needed to develop targeted cancer therapies. Cancer treatment screening typically involves use of a synthetic polymer-based substrate, which leads to undesired defects in cell cultures. These polymer substrates are controlled by electromechanical forces that do not accurately replicate natural cell environments. However, Purdue researchers have used magnetic actuators that are adaptable in both amplitude and frequency to apply specific strain that accurately suspends cells over a gap between actuators. In testing with 18,000 cells, within 24 hours a cell culture was ready to be studied. The system allows researchers and medical professionals to capture dynamic physiological conditions in 3D.Advantages:-Biomimetic-Enhanced cancer therapy-High throughputPotential Applications:-Cancer screening-Microbiology-Tissue engineering"
Pupillometer with Direct and Consensual Pupillary Reflex Measurement and Disease Classification,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new pupillometer for detecting sensory and motor function in the brain. The highly sensitive pupillometer can evaluate activity in the optic nerve and oculomotor nerve as well as conduct stem assessment. In addition, the device uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to compare results with a deep learning database to pinpoint lesions. Currently, pupillometers are only adapted to check one eye at a time, but often there can be damage to a consensual reflex that goes unnoticed. Purdue researchers have fine-tuned their pupillometer to feature a telecentric lens that enhances biodynamic image acquisition and thereby allows optometrists to obtain highly accurate measurements for reliable diagnostics. In addition, researchers integrate an invisible infrared light source instead of traditional visible light to prevent artifacts from appearing in one's vision.Advantages:-Accurate-Fast image acquisitionPotential Applications:-Optometry-Health Monitoring"
Fluorescent Probes for Monitoring Serine Ubiquitination by Bacterial Enzymes,"Purdue University researchers have developed a fluorometric assay for real-time monitoring of ubiquitination events catalyzed by bacterial SidE enzymes in Legionella infections. The assay is well suited for high-throughput identification of Legionella infection inhibitors. The enzymes of the Legionella SidE family catalyze host protein ubiquitination events via a recently discovered mechanism distinct from ubiquitination by eukaryotic enzymes and are required for optimal Legionella infection. Contemporary methods to investigate the ubiquitination activity of SidEs include mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE gel shift assays. These current techniques are not continuous, only measuring the end point of the reaction, and are not amenable to high throughput formats. Purdue researchers synthesized a fluorescently labelled synthetic substrate peptide for SdeA, a member of the SidE family, that displays a change in fluorescence polarization when ubiquitinated by the enzyme. This technology is amendable to high throughput screening and will assist in discovery of inhibitors for Legionella infection as well as identifying and characterizing SidE-like enzymes in other bacterial species. Advantages:-Real-Time SidE Ubiquitination Analysis-Amenable to High Throughput ScreeningPotential Applications:-Legionella Research-Investigating Ubiquitination Events-Fluorescence PolarizationRelated Publication: Fluorescent Probes for Monitoring Serine Ubiquitination Biochemistry 2020, 59, 13, 1309–1313 ​https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00067"
CAFs are a leading reason for ineffective cancer treatments,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for making drug conjugates through antifibrotic ligand-targeting. Currently, Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) tend to progressively resist pharmacotherapies. CAFs are responsible for spontaneous cell motility, growth of tumors, and often cancer relapse in patients. Aiming to provide sensitive patient care, the Purdue University drug conjugate reduces immunosuppression and chemoresistance. The drug can be used for treating fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, wounds, and cancers. Epithelial carcinomas can now be detected non-invasively, and when tested in mice ninety-eight percent of fibroblast cells were accurately detected. In addition, this conjugate-based method can be used to prevent and treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis disease, which remains untreated in one hundred twenty-eight thousand people.Advantages:-Ligand-targeted -Enhanced pharmacotherapy-Precise identification of tumor microenvironmentsPotential Applications:-Imaging for cancer and inflammatory diseases-Cancer therapy"
Water Soluble Human Calcitonin for Treatment of Osteoporosis and Calcium-related Disorders,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a prodrug form of the peptide hormone, human calcitonin, to increase its effectiveness as an osteoporosis treatment. In humans, calcitonin is the hormone responsible for normal calcium homeostasis. When prescribed to osteoporosis patients, calcitonin inhibits bone resorption resulting in increased bone mass. Unfortunately, human calcitonin undergoes fibrillation in aqueous solution leading to reduced efficacy when used as a therapeutic. As a substitute, osteoporosis patients are prescribed salmon calcitonin which does not fibrillate as rapidly but suffers from low potency and immunotoxicity. To decrease the fibrillation propensity and increase the therapeutic benefit of human calcitonin, Purdue researchers phosphorylated specific amino acid residues. This modification's ability to inhibit fibril formation was validated in comparison to the unphosphorylated calcitonin through thioflavin T- fluorescence, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and circular dichroism. This prodrug approach will increase the therapeutic potential of human calcitonin, promising a more effective option to replace salmon calcitonin for osteoporosis and related disorders.Advantages:-Stable solution of human calcitonin-Higher potency than salmon calcitonin-Less toxicity than salmon calcitoninPotential Applications:-Drug Development-Osteoporosis Treatment-Hypercalcemia Treatment"
Human Monoclonal Folate Receptor Beta Antibody,"Folic acid is a vitamin required for the synthesis of DNA nucleotide bases and is essential for proliferation of all cells. To take in folic acid, some cells express a folate receptor that binds folic acid very tightly and carries it into the cell via endocytosis. There are four types of folate receptors: alpha; beta; gamma; delta, and these receptors are preferentially overexpressed on cancer cells.  Purdue University researchers have developed a method for using a human monoclonal antibody against beta folate receptors. By targeting cancer cells and binding antibodies to the beta folate receptors on those cells, researchers can block some of the beta folate receptors on the cells. This lowers the amount of folic acid the cancer cell is receiving and prevents its rapid proliferation. By attaching chemical groups to the antibody, e.g. therapeutics or imaging agents, this approach can be used to potentially treat or identify cancers. It is particularly useful for targeting of chronic and acute leukemia, and has potential to treat these disorders, along with immunological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Advantages:-Lowers the amount of folic acid cancer cells take in-Potential cancer treatment-Also treats inflammatory disorders"
Tool to Identify Host Proteins Involved in Viral and Bacterial Pathogenesis,"Purdue researchers have developed a chemical probe to facilitate quantitative proteomic analysis of potential drug targets for infectious diseases, identifying interactions between infectious particles and host proteins. Pathogens rely on their host's cells to proliferate and must bind to host cellular components. The weak and often transient nature of these interactions make capturing these interactions difficult due to harsh measures available to isolate such interactions. To aid in mitigating the high false positive rate brought about by these contemporary methods, Purdue researchers have synthesized chemical probes to label bacteria or virus particles that crosslink with interacting host proteins during infection. The probe contains a modifiable isolation tag to allow for identification of host proteins through mass spectrometry. The researchers have demonstrated this technology by isolating host proteins that directly interact with Salmonella and Zika virus, which might be critical for their pathogenesis. This method could serve as a universal tool to map the entry pathway of other pathogens.Related Publication:Tracking Pathogen Infections by Time-Resolved Chemical ProteomicsAngewandte Chemie, Feb 2020, Vol.132(6), pp.2255-2260DOI: 10.1002/anie.201911078Advantages:-Able to identify previously unknown protein interactions-High throughputPotential Applications:-Drug development-Viral and bacterial pathogenesis research"
Electrochemical Detection Device for COVID-19 in Saliva,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a wireless biosensor that contains DNA primers for nCOVID-19 in order to rapidly and non-invasively test for the virus in patient saliva. Current technology for nCOVID-19 testing is often invasive, is not efficient, or involves testing for antibody activity rather than viral strands. The platform created by Purdue researchers features an inkjet-printed gold electrode that allows for communication with a software application so that electronic readout can be conducted on-site. The electrochemical device has been evaluated in-lab at Purdue University with a library of nCOVID-19 DNA primers to achieve distinction between nCOVID-19, the flu, and other viruses for enhanced detection.Advantages:-Rapid -On-site -Accurate -WirelessPotential Applications:-Biomedical -Sensors"
Activity-Based Probes with Unnatural Amino Acids to Monitor the Proteasome in Living Cells,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a set of activity-based probes which have shown improved fluorescence properties and selectivity towards the proteasome compared to other cellular proteases.  They have included unnatural amino acids and have found probes which can be utilized in various applications, including monitoring the effects of small molecule stimulators of the proteasome in live cells and comparing the relative proteasome activity across different cancer cell types. Advantages:-Improved Proteasome Sensitivity-Cell-Based Assay CompatibilityPotential Applications:-High throughput assays-Finding Proteasome Stimulators and Inhibitors"
Small Molecule Proteasome Stimulators of Proteasome for Protein Degradation to Treat Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases ,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed small molecule stimulators of the enzyme responsible for routine protein degradation, the 20S core particle of the proteasome (20S CP). The researchers were motivated to develop 20S CP stimulators as a pharmaceutical intervention to degrade the damaged and disordered proteins associated with a variety of disease states including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The hit compound discovered by Purdue's researchers stimulates catalytic activity of the 20S CP. This stimulator molecule increased the degradation of a peptide probe as well as several full-length proteins by the 20S CP versus a control without the stimulator. In a cell line expressing alpha-synuclein, a protein found aggregated in neurodegenerative diseases, the stimulator enhanced degradation of this protein 200-300 percent. The researchers are now developing derivatives of the hit compound towards a new therapeutic lead. These new molecules pave the way for a drug to prevent debilitating and life-threatening diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.Advantages:-Stimulates 20S core of the proteasome-Selective for 20S CP versus 26S proteasomePotential Applications-Treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases-Treatment for aging and disease processes associated with protein aggregation"
Biological Sensing and Actuation Using CMOS SOI Microelectrode Arrays,"Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are devices that serve as neural interfaces, connecting neural signals to electronic circuitry. Current MEAs are not fabricated in a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) platform; therefore, they suffer from low yield and low sensitivity and require packaging to bring the lead out. The CMOS version of MEA is not flexible and still requires packaging.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a highly-flexible microelectrode array built on a complementary metal oxide semiconductor chip that senses live cells, neurons, and live tissues. This technology not only improves the yield and sensitivity, it brings the advantages of CMOS integration, e.g., wireless link and wireless powering. It can be used on concave and pulsating and moving tissues and cells, such as a retina. The technology will make it possible to achieve a single-cell characterization platform, cochlea implant, wireless retina, neural recording devices, and nerve connectors to mend severed peripheral nerves. Advantages:-Highly flexible-Low noise and high fidelity-Wireless link and wireless poweringPotential Applications:-Cochlea implants-Wireless neural prosthetic such as retina implant or wireless neural recording devices"
Adjustable Hearing Aid with Frequency Compression for Clear Speech Perception,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed an algorithm that establishes parameters for audio signals in hearing aids based on a patient's severity of hearing loss. The ability to distinguish between high and low frequencies allows for faster user response, easing every day conversations as well as patient lifestyles. Hearing aids have been adapted to lower frequency through Hybrid Expansive Frequency Compression (hEFC) methods; however, hEFC technology often confuses between high and low frequencies. In addition, hEFC based systems cannot filter background noise and rarely recognize soft sounds like frication. Often, individuals with high frequency hearing loss will start to rely on memory of sounds, which leads to misidentification of phonemes. Purdue University has integrated new technology into hearing aids that keeps different sounds separate and enhances fricatives, affricates, and stop constant barriers. Advantages:-Faster signal time-Eliminates need for frequency remapping -Identifies spectral prominence of sound Potential Applications:-Hearing aids -Assistive biotechnology"
Optical Detection of Pathogen Interaction with Immortal Cell Line,"Finding biological pathogens requires recovery, concentration, and interrogation of small numbers of pathogenic bacteria. Current technologies face practical limitations, particularly in rapidly determining phenotypes of small numbers of isolated microorganisms. Conventional methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genomic technologies, enrichment, and molecular recognition require several limitations and sometimes do not offer solid results. These approaches do not enable the rapid detection of unknown pathogens.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method to rapidly detect the presence of unknown pathogens using an immortal cell line as a sensitive detector. This method is better than conventional methods because it is more sensitive, rapid, and is able to detect unknown pathogenic bacteria. The method can also be used to detect food pathogens such as Listeria and Salmonella. Advantages: -Detects unknown pathogenic bacteria-Sensitive-RapidPotential Applications: -Food safety-Biosecurity"
Purification of Elastin-like Polypeptides by Organic Solvent Extraction ,"Protein purification is being increasingly used in a variety of ways, mostly in biomedical applications.  They have beneficial physicochemical properties.  The current method of purification is very labor intensive.  It also results in yield loss and contamination.  The required temperature for this method is very high which is what causes the yield loss during the process.  This current method also takes hours to complete which is very time consuming.  Sense it takes so much time to complete, it is not very cost effective either.  There is a need for a new method of protein purification that is more efficient overall.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that makes protein purification more efficient.  This new method is faster than the current method.  This method takes only about 30 minutes compared to hours with the current method.  Also, this method does not cause loss of yield during the process because it requires a much lower temperature.  Another thing is this method causes much less contamination of the protein during the process.  All of these things allow this new process to be much more efficient than the current method. Advantages: -Faster than current method-High yield-Creates less contaminationPotential Applications: -Polypeptide purification-Organic solvent extractionRelated Publications:Ross VerHeul, Craig Sweet and David H. Thompson, Rapid and simple purification of elastin-like polypeptides directly from whole cells and cell lysates by organic solvent extraction. Biomater. Sci., 2018, 6, 863DOI: 10.1039/c8bm00124c"
Faster and More Controlled RF Heating for Lyophilization Based on Statistical Electromagnetics,"Researcher at Purdue University have created a high power Radio Frequency Heating method that is controllable and optimal through statistical electromagnetism. Frequencies are selected based on type of material, frozen bulk is then uniformly heated volumetrically, and heat energy is distributed uniformly. The novel setup saves time, reduces energy consumption in the lyophilization process, and creates a product loss factor of less than one tenth for organic constituents. The advanced RF technique features an additional abrupt turn-off option for precise control of heating, relieving any need to adjust time, temperature, pressure, or shelf layouts for vials to obtain better results. Freeze drying can become considerably more efficient for pharmaceutical manufacturing and developing biotechnology.Advantages:-Heating uniformity -Selective heating within chamber -Less product loss -Saves time-Abrupt turn off feature   Potential Applications:-Pharmaceutical drug manufacturing-Biotechnology development-Food industry/freeze drying meats, coffee, etc."
Regulation of Plant Nodulation by Rhizobial tRNA-Derived Small RNAs,"Nitrogen-fixation is often the limiting factor for plant growth and crop yield, because nodulation is hindered by inefficient interactions between Rhizobial bacteria and plants. This technology uses tRNA-derived small RNAs to increase root hair curling and nodule number in legumes. Through gene editing of plants with the tRNA-derived small RNAs, the number of productive Rhizobial infections is dramatically increased. Genetic engineering of plants to promote nodulation has applications in enhancing nitrogen-fixation in legumes and in extending nitrogen fixation capabilities to non-legumes.Advantages:-Improved nitrogen fixation-Lower cost of inputsPotential Applications: -Engineering plants to improve nitrogen fixation"
Reporter Molecule for Study of Alzheimer's Disease,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed pH-dependent fluorogenic amyloid-beta reporters for the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglial phagocytosis of amyloid-beta peptides is a critical step in the regulation of brain homeostasis during the initiation and progression of AD. Unlike common methods to study this phenomenon, this technology is specific for amyloid-beta and functions in live cells. The reporter, an isoform of human amyloid-beta tagged with a pH-dependent fluorogenic moiety, fluoresces only upon phagocytosis in the acidic intracellular phagosomes. It clearly differentiates between phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells within live human and nonhuman microglial cells. This technology promises to aid in the discovery of new therapeutics for AD.Advantages: -Facilitates live cell tracking of microglial phagocytosis-Differentiates between phagocytic and non-phagocytic microglial cellsPotential Applications: -Development of Alzheimer's Therapeutics"
An Antibody for the Detection of Protein Levels in Bacterial Cells,"Scientific experiments rely upon conditions being the same across all trials except for the variable being tested. This can be difficult in a microbiological setting due to the very nature of microorganisms, specifically bacteria. With bacteria being so small, it is virtually impossible to acquire a specific count of the total bacteria involved in an experiment. This problem is usually addressed with the use of components of stable complex or other cell components, which are not reliable.Researchers at Purdue University have invented a new method of comparing the number of bacteria in experiments. The solution is based around the development of an antibody against the bacterial metabolic enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH). The antibody can recognize ICDH from a wide range of bacteria, including both gram positive and gram negative types. This will allow scientists in numerous research fields to get more accurate initial bacteria counts, which will improve experiment setups."
In vitro Model for Testing Efficacy and Neurotoxicity of Neurotherapeutic,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a physiologically relevant in vitro screening tool combining blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability testing with subsequent neuronal response to evaluate the effects of permeation on observed neuroactivity in one assay. Clinical translation of neurotheraputics significantly lags behind the rapid increase in neurological disorders seen worldwide. One of the primary hurdles to neurotherapeutic development is the blood brain barrier (BBB). Others have developed in vitro assays to emulate the BBB; however, the result of these assays does not translate to real efficacy, because the assays do not incorporate downstream neuroactivity or associated neurotoxicity as the Purdue technology does. Preliminary tests of the Purdue technology revealed it correctly rank-orders compounds compared to known parameters. The technology is versatile and can be adapted to utilize multiple cell types. The technology promises to reduce the resources needed for ranking hit and lead candidate compounds in the development of new neurotheraputic agents.Advantages-Promises to reduce time and cost associated with pharmaceutical development-Flexible system: adaptable to multiple cell types-Increased translational efficiencyPotential Applications-Neurotherapeutic drug development-Drug Discovery and Development"
Technique for Engineering Centimeter-size Model Tumors,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method that produces in vitro tumors in the centimeter-size range with relevant pathological traits. In contrast, current in vitro 3D cultures or ""microtumors"" typically yield cell aggregates less than 800 microns in size. Although these microtumors successfully mimic cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions observed in vivo, tumors in that size range are rarely detected in the clinic. Further, large engineered tumors produced by aggregation begin to die within a few hours. Larger, more stable in vitro models with clinically relevant architecture and cell phenotypes would be more relevant for testing drug delivery systems and other potential therapies. Bioprinting has been applied to the creation of large multicellular tumors that are reproducible and finely controllable; however, bioprinting requires high levels of expertise and access to expensive equipment. Using a simpler process, the Purdue researchers' tumors remain viable for weeks and have traits relevant to the clinical phenotype, including a heterogeneous composition consisting of both preinvasive and invasive phenotypes and a structure allowing for adequate diffusion of nutrients both within the construct and to an exogenous extracellular matrix.Advantages: -Large tumors with clinically relevant phenotype-Tumors can survive several days (even weeks)-Does not require access to a bioprinter or training on how to use a bioprinterPotential Applications:-Evaluation of drug delivery systems or other proposed therapies"
Quantitative Sensor to Measure Cellular Metabolism,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a protein-based, genetically-encoded bioluminescent sensor that can report changes in intracellular ATP in live cells.  This new sensor could be very useful for research purposes in cancer biology to measure cell health and chemotherapeutic drug efficacy.   Advantages:-Measurement is independent of bioluminescence decay -Precisely quantifies cell health and metabolismPotential Applications:-High throughput drug discovery -Life animal imaging"
Liquid Biopsy for Determining Breast Cancer Subtypes,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method that can differentiate cancer subtypes and aid in early detection for breast cancer. Early diagnosis and identification of the disease may permit earlier intervention and treatment and more successful outcomes for patients. Blood testing aka ""liquid biopsy"" for early diagnosis and monitoring of cancer is highly attractive; however, the number and complexity of various proteins in the blood makes the identification of appropriate diagnostic markers a serious challenge. This innovation reduces the complexity of the liquid biopsy samples. Extracellular vesicles, membrane encapsulated particles whose contents are protected from enzymes in the blood, are isolated from the blood and used as a source of biomarkers. This technology isolates extracellular vesicles from a patient sample and analyzes their contents to differentiate breast cancer subtypes. With knowledge of the specific breast cancer subtype, doctors can better tailor treatment for the patient. Advantages:-Differentiate cancer subtypes-Allows for tailored treatmentPotential Applications:-Breast cancer diagnosis-Subtype identification"
Engineering NK Cells to Treat Cancers Driven by Adenosine Immunosuppression,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a cell therapy capable of exerting a cytotoxic effect on CD73 expressing cancer cells. Adenosine immunosuppression is a regulatory mechanism of the immune system that protects against autoimmunity. However, this mechanism also drives cancers that express the enzyme, CD73. This enzyme produces adenosine, a molecule that inhibits immune cells. The Purdue technology circumvents this adenosine-mediated immunosuppression to treat cancer.Purdue's researchers engineered a type of immune cell, the natural killer (NK) cell, to target and kill cancer cells. The cells are engineered to express a protein consisting of an extracellular CD73 antibody fragment for targeting and an intracellular signaling domain that activates the NK cell to destroy the cancer cell. This potential therapy circumvents adenosine immunosuppression in the solid tumor microenvironment, selectively targeting cancer cells with engineered immune cells. The engineered NK cells have been successfully tested against glioblastoma cell lines and in vivo in lung carcinoma models, supporting this technology as a transformative cancer treatment to effectively target solid tumors. Advantages-Selective cancer therapeutic-NK cell mediated cytotoxicityPotential Applications-Cancer therapeutic-Circumvent adenosine immunosuppression"
Microwave Assisted Freeze Drying,"Primary drying is the most critical and time-consuming step in the lyophilization process used widely in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. To achieve minimal product loss, common practice is to optimize the recipe (time, temperature, and pressure) in each step of the lyophilization process, which wastes time unnecessarily. Purdue researchers have developed a technology that uses microwave assisted heating in place of conventional heating. It allows for precise heating control of the frozen substance, including the ability to apply heat energy to specific locations inside the lyophilization chamber. Advantages: -Precise tuning of heating properties-Selective heating of specific locations-Faster processing timePotential Applications: -Pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry-Food industry"
Highly Potent HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors,"There is a need to develop new treatments for patients living with HIV-1, as HIV-1 rapidly acquires resistance to treatment options. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Compared to darunavir, a leading FDA approved drug, these compounds were 100 times more potent in cell culture. Additionally, the compounds have improved metabolic stability over previous protease inhibitors. The primary application for these compounds is for the treatment of multidrug-resistant HIV-1. Advantages: -Improved potency against HIV-1-Improved pharmacokinetic propertiesPotential Applications: -HIV/AIDS treatment"
Surfaces Self-disinfect Using Built-in UV Lighting,"Decontamination via UV light is used on surfaces and water. The use of UV light as a disinfectant is popular in hospitals when it comes to cleaning surfaces unable to sustain chemicals. Additionally, chemicals are expensive and dangerous; there is also an economical and safety benefit. There is no record of any bacteria showing resistance to this method. However, for the process to be successful, the lighting source has to be a within a certain distance of the surface. Due to the size of the source, it is difficult to be in close proximity; this decreases the amount of power received by the surface and increases the potential of the shadow effect. The shadow effect is one of the main issues with the current approach. If anything is blocking the light from reaching the surface (causing a shadow), then that part of the surface will not be disinfected. The need is a solution to the shadow effect.Researchers at Purdue University developed a new approach to disinfection using UV light which eliminates the shadow effect, requires less power, and eliminates the current bulky light sources. The shadow effect is eliminated when the UV-light source exists in the surface, itself. Additionally, more space becomes available when extra equipment is no longer required. Initially, such changes would have the greatest impact on hospitals and water decontamination. However, this could eventually minimize the use of chemicals in general.    Advantages: -The entire surface area is covered-Requires less power-More space becomes available since additional equipment (lighting) is no longer requiredPotential Applications: -Disinfection of surface areas-Disinfection of water"
Plant Virus-Like Particles as Biotemplates for Nanoparticle Synthesis,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed plant virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from Barley-Stripe Mosaic Virus that can be used as biotemplates for synthesizing nanoparticles. The VLPs can be easily genetically modified to tune their size and shape prior to metal deposition. The researchers found that the VLPs adsorb twice as much metal as VLPs compared to Tobacco Mosaic Virus, allowing for thicker coatings and unique nanosynthesis opportunities. Furthermore, the VLPs have a unique region that is surface-exposed and can be engineered for additional desired properties, such as accelerated deposition rate. The applications for these VLPs is in the miniaturization of electronic devices, such as in battery electrodes. Advantages: -	Uniform nanomaterial -	Twice amount of metal adsorbed compared to Tobacco Mosaic -	Environmentally-friendly Potential Applications: -	Battery electrodes -	Small electronic devices"
Liposomal Carriers with High Drug Loading Capacity,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for encapsulating drugs in liposomes with higher efficiency than competing methods. Liposomal encapsulation of chemotherapeutic agents is widely used to reduce nonspecific side effects, because liposomes will preferentially target the tumor's leaky vasculature. Liposomes are typically loaded with drugs using pH gradients. However, some drugs, such as gemcitabine, a first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer, have proven difficult to load into liposomes with reasonable efficiency. In a proof-of-concept study using this new method, gemcitabine had a loading efficiency of 9.4 - 10.3 wt% compared to 0.14 - 3.8 wt% by conventional methods. Applications for this technology include in the development of novel drug formulations for the treatment of cancer.Advantages: -Higher drug loading efficiency-Good stability and sustained release of drugPotential Applications: -Pharmaceutical formulations"
High Sensitivity Glutamate Biosensor,"Glutamate excitotoxicity (GE) is a dynamic process by which neurons are damaged due to excessive amount of glutamate in the cell. It is hypothesized by scientists that glutamate excitotoxicity is a secondary injury that can occur after spinal cord injury (SCI). The limited knowledge of the role of glutamate in secondary injury has limited the development of therapeutics for GE. In 2016, the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center reported 300,000 people currently live with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States. SCI is a debilitating illness that often leaves patients with limited mobility. The lifetime healthcare cost per patient can range from $1,200,000 to $5,000,000 per patient. Current bioanalytical techniques such as nuclear resonance imaging have low spatiotemporal resolution and poor sensitivity for determining glutamate levels. Since glutamate excitotoxicity is dynamic in nature and can progress over time, it is crucial that the glutamate diagnostic tools possess high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity of glutamate.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a biosensor with superior sensitivity for measuring glutamate levels in hopes to better understand GE. In in vitro studies, it was found that the newly developed biosensor exhibited 6 times higher glutamate sensitivity in comparison to glutamate biosensors fabricated in other labs. The biosensor had high selectivity for glutamate with a detection limit 14 µM. Advantages: -	Superior sensitivity for glutamate-	High selectivity for glutamate-	Simplify process of measuring glutamatePotential Applications: -	Glutamate biosensor"
Smartphone-Based Device for Bioluminescence Detection,"Smartphone cameras have uses beyond the usual photos taken for social media apps. There are potential applications in searching for biological matter in environmental surveys and on-site food safety inspections. However, for widespread usage of smartphone-based detection, there is a bottleneck of low sensitivity associated with the sensor of a standard commercial smartphone. Other methods, such as sending actual samples to a laboratory for analysis using high sensitivity detectors, delay the results and impose economic losses in cases of food inspection.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a smartphone-based device and image processing method to maximize the sensitivity of the typical smartphone camera. The proposed hardware/software combination, named the ""Bioluminescent-based Analyte Quantitation by Smartphone (BAQS),"" provides a quick, on-site method for analysis of samples tagged with a bioluminescent probe. A structure houses the smartphone, sample, and collection lens, while an algorithm lowers the signal background and enhances the signal from bioluminescent photons. Advantages:-Simple & inexpensive-Achieves large increases in detection-On-site; no delays in sending samples to labsPotential applications:-Environmental surveying-Food inspection"
Liposomal Formulation of Combinational Antibiotics,Liposomal formulations have been developed for single drugs such as ciprofloxacin but not for combinational antibiotics. Liposomal formulations have shown significant less irritation to the respiratory tract and much better safety in previous clinical trials. Developing liposomal formulations for combinational antibiotics might be beneficial for the treatment of respiratory infections.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new liposomal formulation of combinational antibiotics for the treatment of respiratory infections. This new formulation incorporates two synergistic antibiotics to enable maximum bacteria killing against resistant pathogens while significantly reducing irritation to the respiratory tract.Advantages: -Maximum bacteria killing against resistant pathogens-Reduce resistance developmentPotential Applications: -Treatment of respiratory infections-Eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Antibacterial Agents Against Methicillin- and Vancomycin-Resistant Bacteria,"The discovery and development of antibiotics revolutionized health care in such a way that bacterial infections, which were otherwise deadly, could be treated; however, this was met with a rapid development of resistant bacterial strains that rendered many antibiotics ineffective. Consequently, millions of people are infected with drug-resistant bacterial strains yearly resulting in thousands of deaths. Efforts need to be directed towards identifying and developing novel structures as antibacterial agents with possibly novel mechanisms of action.Researchers at Purdue University have identified compounds with potent antibacterial activities. The most potent compounds inhibited growth of various-resistant Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Some compounds were active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA and VRSA respectively), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). Through resistance generation experiments it was revealed that MRSA could not develop resistance to one of these compounds.Advantages: -Compounds can kill methicillin and vancomycin-resistant bacteria-No resistance from MRSA-Potent activity against drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens	Potential Applications: -Pharmaceuticals/biotech companies-Animal medicine-Bacterial burden in skin wound infectionsRelated Publications:Clement Opoku-Temeng et al., N-(1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzamide analogs, bacteriostatic agents against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant bacteriaEuropean Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2018https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.06.023"
"Live Cell Conjugation Chemistry for Imaging, Sensing, Biomanufacturing, and Cell Therapy","Surface modification of live cells has many biomedical and therapeutic applications, such as live cell imaging and cell therapy. The current approaches have limitations including poor stability over time and incompatibility with mammalian cells due to toxicity. There is a need for a new technology that improves surface modification of live cells. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that enables surface modification of live mammalian cells. This cell-modification technology has applications in live cell imaging, manufacturing of cell therapies, enhancement of cells for therapeutic applications, cell-drug conjugation for enhanced killing of cancer cells, and drug delivery in a pH dependent manner to sites of inflammation. This technology conjugates small molecules, proteins, fluorophores, and PET tracers to live cells without nanoparticles or other vehicles.Advantages: -Conjugation to cell membranes without killing cells -Functionalizes living cells with components such as small molecules, proteins, fluorophores, and PET tracers -No use of nanoparticles or other vehicles Potential Applications: -Cell membrane imaging -Enhanced cell therapy-Production of therapeutic cells"
DNA-Guided Gene Editing Tools,Gene editing has been a much sought after and very controversial technology.  Clustered Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is the current widely known gene editing technology.  The problem with this current technology is it restricted to targeting regions adjacent to a specific motif.  Another issue with CRISPR is that it can cause mutations throughout the genome.  This problem accounts for one of the reasons that gene editing is such a controversial topic.  There is a need for a new gene editing technology that could potentially solve these controversial issues.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology pertaining to gene editing.  This new method consists of Argonaute from Natronbacterium gregoryi or its mutants that target the enzyme to cleave specific regions of a chromosome or other extra chromosomal genetic material.  The DNA guides are designed as 24 nucleotides complementary to a gene of interest.  This technology reduces random cleavage and may be used for targeting gene editing.  This new technology could open the door for how gene editing is approached in the future. Advantages: -More flexible-Not restricted to certain regionsPotential Applications: -Gene editing-Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes
Therapeutics for Triple Negative Breast Cancer,"More than 200,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States.  The most aggressive type of breast cancer, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), disproportionately affects young premenopausal women of African-American or Hispanic descent. Chemotherapy remains the only treatment for TNBC; however, chemotherapy does not specifically target cancer cells, causing debilitating side effects. A new, targeted therapy is needed to treat TNBC without adverse effects. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that could change how breast cancer is treated. The researchers have developed new drug candidates that are potent at lower concentrations than chemotherapy. The technology employs molecules that are selectively taken up by cancer cells and activated by light. In vitro, this therapeutic drug is photoactive at the nanomolar range with an appropriate light dose adjustment and has no observable toxicity when not exposed to light. This targeted therapy promises to reduce the dosage of drug needed to treat TNBC and effectively reduce side effects. Advantages: -Reduced adverse effects-Targeted therapy -Potent at low concentrations Potential Applications: -Breast cancer -Cancer therapeuticsRelated Publication:Photodynamic Activity of Vitamin-Chlorin Conjugates at Nanomolar Concentrations against Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsACS Omega 2019, 4, 2, 2907-2920DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.8b02323"
Smartphone-Based Device for Monitoring Chemical Pollutants in Water,"Enhanced frequency in monitoring water-borne pollutants is important to curbing inadvertent consumption of contaminated water. Conventional analytical instruments, such as atomic absorption fluorescent spectrometer and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, are not amenable for such frequent monitoring needs given the high cost to purchase and maintain, require highly-trained personnel, and delicate sample handling and transportation. There is need for an inexpensive method for on-site monitoring of water-borne pollutants more easily. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a smartphone-based device for monitoring target contaminants in water samples. Water containing target ions react with specific colorimetric reagent, yielding colorimetric analytes, which vary in intensity as the concentration of the target ion changes. This technology puts into consideration, the complete and composite undulations in the image properties of the analyte under investigation. This relationship formed the basis for the development of an algorithm utilized in the smartphone based monitoring device with the capability of recalibration in the event of a change in device or lighting condition. The ease of operation, ubiquity, robust algorithm, cost effectiveness, and novel approach in this technology is noteworthy, especially with the fast assay time. Advantages: -Uses a smartphone-User friendly-Cost effective-Widely available-Easy to operate-Fast resultsPotential Applications: -Industries that deal with pollutants-Wastewater Treatment Plants-Drinking Water Treatment Plants-Municipalities,-State and Federal Environmental Protection Agencies-World Health Organization"
Crops with Increased Resistance to Fungal Disease,"Fungal disease is a major challenge in crop production. Sorghum is an important food crop in Africa and parts of Asia. In the United States, sorghum is used primarily for livestock feed and ethanol production. Recently, the United States has seen an increase in Sorghum's use as food given it is gluten-free. Anthracnose is the leading global disease of sorghum. While anthracnose resistant germplasm is available, specific resistance regulators and mechanisms of function have not been determined. There is a need to identify these fungal resistance mechanisms used by sorghum plants and exploit such mechanisms to generate broad-spectrum resistance in the plant.Researchers at Purdue University have identified a gene that could improve disease resistance in crops susceptible to disease. It confers broad-spectrum and complete resistance in sorghum and other plants, such as wheat, barley, rice, maize, oats, rye, or millet. Genome editing directly in improved and adapted cultivars to generate broad-spectrum resistance will considerably shorten the breeding cycle and make it possible to determine the precise means of regulation. This gene will be useful in generating disease resistant plants.Advantages: -Reliable fungal resistance -Shortened breeding cycle-Breeding disease-resistant plants-Reduced crop lossPotential Applications: -Crop producers-Agricultural companies-Seed companies"
EGF-Targeted Bladder Cancer Therapeutic,"The American Cancer Society (ACS) annually issues estimates for new cancer diagnoses and cancer deaths. For 2016, ACS estimates for bladder cancer is 76,960 new diagnoses and 16,390 deaths. Bladder cancer is the fourth and eleventh most common cancer in men and women respectively. The average age at diagnosis is 73 and 90 percent of patients are over the age 55. It is estimated that the annual national cost of bladder cancer care will reach $5.25 billion in 2020. Approximately 70 percent of newly diagnosed patients suffer disease recurrence after surgical treatment and more than 20 percent develop invasive bladder cancer. There is a need to develop efficient therapeutic strategies against this pathology.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a therapeutic strategy using a modified bacterial toxin to target the EGF receptor and destroy bladder cancer cells. This agent proved to be superior due to its specificity and high efficacy at eliminating cancer cells, taking only minutes for treatment with enhanced safety. In animal studies, there were no toxic side effects and it was very effective against treatment-resistant tumors in dogs.  Advantages:-Non-surgical treatment option-Treatment takes minutes vs. hours-Promising results in animal studiesPotential Applications:-Bladder cancer treatment"
Open Gradient Exposure Platform for Cell Culture,"The tissue microenvironment plays a role in normal development and disease and led to the exploration of cell culture approaches to integrate controlled microenvironmenal conditions by scientists. The production of chemicals, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), is frequent in the microenvironment and may lead to oxidative stress, which is present in several pathologies including metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. To assess the impact of ROS on cells requires the measurement of the oxidative DNA damage inside the cells and levels of expression of antioxidant proteins. ROS also triggers changes in nuclear morphology, which is important for the control of cell behavior, including the aggressiveness of cancer cells. For instance, progression from preinvasive to invasive cancer depends on local microenvironmental conditions; hence, the level of ROS might be critical in order to reach a threshold leading to progression switch for certain types of cancers. Therefore, a cell culture system that enables assessing, in the same culture sample, the impact of ROS delivered as a gradient might help sort out relationships among ROS-induced cellular injury, cellular protective response to oxidative stress, and developing phenotypic changes revealed by nuclear morphology.Purdue University researchers have developed an open gradient exposure platform for creating a gradient of a chemical and/or testing the dose-dependent impact of a chemical, e.g., toxin, drug, ion, and on cells and tissues, by providing a lab-on-a-chip microenvironment. This platform allows for controlled chemical delivery through a paper microfluidic underlayer set up, enabling easy access and analysis of the response of cells and tissues due to the open chamber, unlike the closed microfluidic gradient systems. As a proof-of-concept, Purdue researchers have demonstrated with the gradient-on-a-chip that the level of ROS exposure significantly affects the extent of the cellular response, notably for nuclear morphology, a potential marker of phenotypic changes, and that a same cellular response occurs for different levels of ROS depending on extracellular matrix stiffness.  These results demonstrate the importance of threshold for the impact of a chemical depending on the initial tissue condition. Changes occurred after only four hours; the use of the gradient-on-a-chip in future studies over several days is possible. This platform progressively acquires a more comprehensive picture of the microenvironmental impact on the response to chemical exposure and is amenable for different cell culture conditions, e.g., standard 2D culture, 3D culture with different matrices.Advantages:-Measures the microenvironmental impact on the cellular response to chemical exposure-Measures dose-dependent impact of a chemical on cells-Allows for testing over longer time periods thanks to continuous renewal of the gradient and cell culture medium-Recreates chemical homogeneity or heterogeneity of a microenvironment in a controlled manner-Convenient for gathering cell cultures for additional processing since 2D and 3D cell cultures are done a paper substrate that can be easily handled-Allows for cell culture with liquid-air interface-Provides medium and chemicals from underneath the cells mimicking liquid diffusion to the cells-Easy to assemble, disassemble, and sterilizePotential Applications:-Pharmaceuticals R&D-study of microenvironmental exposure linked to disease risk, onset and progression, as well as microenvironmental conditions that influence tissue development"
Isolation of Adenovirus E1 Expressing Cell Lines and Strategies to Generate Adenovirus Recombinants,"Purdue University researchers have developed a technique for isolating cell lines with desired characteristics in the cell lines expressing adenovirus E1. Following adenovirus infection of a cell, E1 genes are the first viral genes expressed and are essential for virus replication. Therefore, the generation and growth of E1-deleted adenoviral vectors is possible only in a cell line that constitutively expresses E1 proteins. This technology involves the isolation of a number of cell lines expressing either human adenovirus (HAd) or bovine adenovirus (BAd) E1 genes. These isolated cell lines may be useful in generating and replicating adenovirus recombinants for vaccination and gene therapy applications.Advantages:-Better cell lines for propagating E1-deleted HAd or BAd-Simple generation of cell lines with specific characteristicsPotential Applications:-Gene therapy-Vaccines-Drug delivery"
Tannic Acid as a Functional Crosslinker in Polymer Systems,"Current epoxy crosslinkers are amine-based, which are not environmentally friendly. Upon epoxy degradation, the chemicals leech out into the environment. Tannic acid is a well-known, naturally occurring polyphenolic compound used in antioxidants and chelating agents. The study of tannic acid's use in a wide variety of polymer systems as a flame retardant additive is extensive; however, its use as a hardener/cross-linker in epoxy lacks research.  Researchers at Purdue University have developed a thermosetting polymeric composition by crosslinking epoxy by using tannic acid as the hardener. Tannic acid is a more sustainable crosslinker, has less environmental impact, and is inexpensive given it is a byproduct from the papermaking process. This composition has a high glass transition temperature and extended pot-life. This composition also allows for tannic acid's use as functional system to prepare formulations with other properties such as fire retardancy. Advantages:-Environmentally friendly-Inexpensive-High glass transition temperaturePotential Applications:-High performance epoxy-Flame retardant"
Overexpression of Histone Increases Plant Transformation by Agrobacterium,"Agrobacterium has proven to be a useful tool in the transformation of some, but not all, plants.  One problem among recalcitrant plants is the failure of the T-DNA to become integrated into the host genome.  As a result, transformation occurs, but it is transient.     Purdue University researchers have found that a particular histone H2A variant of Arabidopsis is involved in Agrobacterium T-DNA integration into the Arabidopsis genome.  A plant carrying a mutation of this gene cannot integrate T-DNA; however, the wild-type allele can complement this mutation.  In addition, overexpression of the histone H2A gene in wild-type Arabidopsis increases the efficiency of Agrobacterium mediated transformation.  Because the histone H2A gene can reside on the incoming T-DNA and be expressed in the recipient cell, researchers speculate that this effect will improve transformation rates in recalcitrant plants.    Advantages:-Stable Agrobacterium transformation of recalcitrant plants-Unique solution to plant transformation problemsPotential Applications:-Agriculture R&D"
A Digital Micrograph Script for Detection of Astigmatism in Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Images,"Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is a technique used for capturing high resolution images of a wide range of materials including macromolecular complexes at near-atomic resolutions. Minimization of astigmatism of the objective lens is a critical task essential for high resolution TEM imaging. However, the most widely used method currently involves visually examining the roundness of a diffractogram (Thon rings) and simultaneously adjusting objective lens stigmators to make the Thon rings as circular as possible. The drawbacks to this method include limited sensitivity for small astigmatism and potential bias caused by the astigmatism of human eyes. Users can spend upwards to 30 minutes making adjustments.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a system and method that allows for fast and sensitive detection of astigmatism in TEM images. A digital micrograph script allows for such improvements in the readings of astigmatism and allows for real-time feedback to help guide the adjustment of objective lens stigmators and correct the astigmatism of the objective lens. In addition, the script automatically reports the critical imaging parameters by analyzing the Thon Rings. All of this can help improve the accuracy and resolution of TEM imaging.Advantages:-Fast, sensitive detection of astigmatism in TEM images-Real-time feedback adjustment of objective lens-Users rely on script versus visual examination-Less bias than visual examination-Works with existing systems-Automatic report of the critical imaging parametersPotential Applications:-Analysis method in physical, chemical, and biological sciences-Cancer research-Virology-Materials science"
Gene Targeting Using VirE2 Mutant Agrobacterium Strains,"Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation is the core technology for introducing genes into plants. Usually, transferred DNA (T-DNA) is integrated into the plant genome in order to stably transform plants. Scientists now wish to use Agrobacterium to deliver DNA that will target plant genes for specific use as gene transfer technology has become more sophisticated. However, this has previously not been possible at a usable frequency. Scientists have also tried to target specific genes; however, off-targeting, which is targeting of related but not identical genes, is a major problem.  These methods are cumbersome and require building complex proteins for targeting.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a unique technology of gene targeting by introducing T-DNA into the plant in the absence of VirE2 protein. It will provide a method of efficient gene targeting without building cumbersome protein scaffold systems. It will also likely have fewer off-target effects.Advantages:-Efficient gene targeting -Fewer off-targetsPotential applications:-Biological identification-Genetic markers-Gene replacement-Genome editing"
Direct Contact Blood Brain Barrier Triculture,"Neurological disorders have been steadily increasing over the last several decades. While drug discovery and development efforts to mitigate these diseases have concurrently increased to meet the change in prevalence, clinical translation into marketed products have been hindered. One of the main difficulties in creating this translation is the lack of a model that can predict the ability of new chemical entities to permeate through the brain blood barrier (BBB). Current models suffer from leakiness of the in vitro cellular tight junctions and that leakiness leads researchers to overestimate the amount of drug permeation.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a model that represents a more restrictive, accurate model of the BBB. This model is a direct contact, triculture model containing astrocytes, pericytes, and the brain microvessel endothelial cells (BMEC) configured in a physiologically similar manner to an in vivo BBB. This method allows for direct contact between the pericytes and the astrocytes and measures the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) as an indirect measure of cell tightness.  Researchers monitor the TEER until they determine a window in which a triculture would be of utility for permeability studies. This model will offer superior selectivity for screening neuroactive or neurotoxicant agents in vitro and help in the rational selection of candidates for advancement into further clinical studies based on its physiological similarity to the in vivo BBB cellular configuration. This model may also be adopted to select compounds that have a lower potential of eliciting a neurotoxicant effect.Advantages:-More accurate model representing the BBB-Allows materials to permeate through it-Allows for direct contact between the astrocytes and pericytesPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceuticals-Research & Development-Drug discovery"
Facile Expression and Purification of USP17 for use in Cancer Drug Discovery,"USP17, a ubiquitin specific enzyme, is responsible for the progression of the cell cycle to promote cellular proliferation. In many cancers, including breast and prostate, USP17 levels are upregulated, promoting unregulated proliferation and cancer. Over the last 10 years, cell-based studies have identified USP17 as a potential target for cancer therapy; however, there has been no advancement in the production of recombinant USP17. Availability of large amounts of purified, recombinant USP17 is critical for developing an anticancer therapeutic against this target.Researchers from Purdue University have developed a methodology for the expression and purification of recombinant USP17, which allows for the utilization of a much wider array of techniques compared to cell based assays. Recombinant USP17 can be used for kinetic, structural, biochemical studies, and other studies of the enzyme and its response to drug candidates. The Purdue researchers' protocol and the resulting recombinant protein provide others with the tools to develop therapeutics against cancers in which USP17 regulation is a major component. This method will help advance the development of anticancer therapeutics that target USP17.Advantages:-Recombinant protein now available-Facilitates drug discoveryPotential Applications:-Drug Discovery-Pharmaceutical industry-Biomedical industry-Biomedical and Pharmaceutical R&D-Medical diagnosis"
Ubiquitination by a Single Enzyme,"Ubiquitin is a protein that is found in almost all cellular tissues in humans and eukaryotic organisms that helps to regulate the processes of other proteins in the body. Signaling by ubiquitination, the process of adding ubiquitin to a substrate protein, helps to regulate virtually all cellular processes in eukaryotes. For example, ubiquitination can signal the cell to degrade proteins, alter a protein's cellular location, or to promote or prevent protein interactions. Due to its importance, ubiquitination is a primary target of various infectious agents.Researchers at Purdue University have demonstrated that L. pneumophila can override ubiquitination signaling in host cells with its own enzymes, including members of the SidE effector family. While ubiquitination is generally catalyzed by a cascade requiring the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, members of the SidE family of bacterial enzymes are capable of performing ubiquitination independent of this cascade. Following this discovery of ubiquitination catalyzed by a single enzyme, this enzyme, SidE, and various SidE constructs hold promise as new tools for research and development in biotechnology.Advantages:-Performs ubiquitination with a single enzymePotential Applications:-Protein research-Bacterial and viral research-Biotechnology"
Carrier-Free Nanoparticle Formulation with Good Circulation Stability,"Nearly 40 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients under development are poorly soluble in aqueous media leading to low bioavailability and erratic absorption. In an attempt to solve this issue, researchers began to develop nanocrystals of these insoluble drugs. Nanocrystals have increased dissolution rates, offering increased solubility. However, fast-dissolving small nanocrystals provide little advantage to solution formulations, and larger nanocrystals are recognized by the immune system.  In addition, current nanoparticle formulations can contain greater than 50 percent excipients; the excipients often present their own adverse effects, which limit the dose.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method to produce pharmaceutical nanocrystals comprised of more than 85 percent of their respective active ingredients. These nanocrystals are coated with albumin to prevent the immune response and allow the nanocrystals to target cancerous cells unhindered. These nanocrystals have the potential to increase the effectiveness of a wide range of drugs as they contain a much greater percentage of active ingredients, allow for increased bioavailability, and avoid immune recognition.Advantages:-Increases bioavailability of insoluble drugs-Fewer adverse effects-Avoids immune recognitionPotential Applications:-Drug formulationRelated Publications:J. Park, et al., Albumin-coated nanocrystals for carrier-free delivery of paclitaxel. Journal of Controlled Release (2016). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.12.040"
Enhanced Insect Susceptibility to Entomopathogens,"A termite population does not only pose a risk because of the significant structural damage they are capable of inflicting on buildings, crops, and forests, but their subterranean, eusocial lifestyle creates a breeding grounds for disease and microbial growth.  Despite decades of research, no commercially viable biocontrol agent targeted at termites has been developed.  Recent research has suggested termites possess superior defense mechanisms that provide them with virtual immunity against fungal and bacterial pathogens.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology that can identify genes and proteins in termites that increase susceptibility to pathogens.  Whereas much research and development have gone into non-specific chemical insecticides that attempt to brute force their way through the termites' defenses, this new technology aims to dismantle the defense outright.  Using treatments of an immune-suppressive nicotinoid insecticide and fungi and bacterial pathogens, hundreds of genes that encode potential defense mechanisms have been identified; the expression of these genes can be suppressed, increasing the termites' susceptibility to pathogens.  Several protist symbiont enzymes were also identified which may have played a central role in protecting termites from fungal entomopathogens, and a recombinant form of these enzymes may have uses as novel drugs to fight fungal infections.Advantages:-More biorational and environmentally friendly than chemical insecticides-Protein-based enzymatic treatment offers a more ""organic"" approach than conventional drugsPotential Applications:-Termite control-Fungal infection treatmentRelated Publication:Molecular Signatures of Nicotinoid-Pathogen Synergy in the Termite Gut. PLoS ONE 10(4): e0123391. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0123391"
Automating Mouse Behavioral Measures,"Mouse experiments are integral to drug discovery and development, but mouse experiments are hampered by three key factors: 1.	Human handling of mice generates stress and fear responses, which can cloud results 2.	Mice are generally nocturnal, but most data is collected during the day by humans, which can taint the data collected 3.	Continuous data collection requires animals to be singly housed, which is expensive and increases animal stress Researchers at Purdue University have developed a general platform that automates data collection, treatments, and the movement of mice between cages without human interference. It integrates data collection with the home cage, allowing for continuous data collection and individual-level data from group-housed animals.Advantages:-Improves quality of animal data by minimizing human interference-Allows for automatic data collection-Integrates data collection with home cage environment-Gathers individual data from group-housed animalsPotential Applications:-Drug discovery and development-Research"
P188 as a Treatment for Trauma to the Nervous System,"Following mechanical injury to the spinal cord, a large number of sensory and motor nerve fibers are disrupted and subsequently destroyed. The major pathology involved in such nerve loss is related to the breakdown of membranes of nerve cell axons, even to the point of complete severance. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and other copolymers seal nerve membrane defects and breaches caused by direct mechanical damage. Purdue University researchers have developed a technology that uses poloxamer P188 in spinal cord injury repair applications. P188 can be applied topically to exposed nerve fibers or by intravenous or subcutaneous injection. Similar research has been done with a related polymer, PEG; however, there are several advantages with using P188 in spinal cord injury applications. Advantages: -Can be produced in sterile form-Can be administered by intravenous or subcutaneous injection-Gives identical functional recovery to topically applied PEGPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Spinal cord injuries"
Microorganisms as Radiation Sensors,"Measuring radiation has been an ever-improving science since radiation became an important topic decades ago. While devices can measure radiation in quantitative fashion, measuring radiation dosages in organisms has been a harder case to solve. Current radiation sensing technologies cannot provide biologically relevant information regarding radiation exposure, which prohibits us from learning the level of radiation damage. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method of measuring radiation that correlates with the actual damage caused by radiation to DNA in organisms. By measuring the reaction outputs of microorganisms supplied by sugar, information can be gathered regarding the extent that radiation damaged the DNA of the cells. This method of measuring radiation in organisms can replace outdated film badges and similar sensors while providing better, more biologically relevant information.Advantages:-Simple design and easy to measure-Provides information useful for biological purposes-Correlates with DNA damagePotential Applications:-Radiation exposure treatment-Laboratory experiments"
PatchSurfer:  Software for Exploring Protein-Ligand Interactions,"Interactions with small ligand molecules are essential aspects of proteins and there is an urgent need for computational methods for function prediction. A major drawback of current approaches is the dependency on the chemical features present in the known actives.Researchers at Purdue University have addressed this major drawback by developing an alignment free, surface-based, pocket comparison program called PatchSurfer. PatchSurfer represents a binding pocket as a combination of segmented surface patches, with each patch characterized by its geometrical shape, the electrostatic potential, the hydrophobicity, and the concaveness. The device searches a database of known pockets and finds similar ones based on the surface patch similarity. Because each surface patch characterizes geometrical and physicochemical properties of a protein pocket and ligand on a continuous surface, the surface representation is less sensitive to subtle changes on the pocket and ligand conformation. This aspect helps to quickly allow a better understanding of protein-ligand interactions, and ultimately, can help to enhance the design of new ligands for a wide array of drug targets. Advantages:-Less sensitive to subtle changes on the pocket/ligand conformation-Faster search speed-New ligands for a wide array of drug targets Potential Applications:-Ligand design-Virtual screening-Pharmaceuticals-Drug targets"
Trapping Particles at Enhanced Speed and Efficiency,"The trapping and aggregating of submicron and nanoscale analytes is especially important in applications such as biosensing and surface enhanced spectroscopies. The technique known as optical tweezers, which traps particles using a strong optical gradient force induced by a focused laser beam, has been one of the most highly used techniques for the past several decades. The use of plasmonic trapping or plasmonic nanotweezers is also becoming popular in order to overcome some of the deficiencies of optical tweezers. Although this new method improves the confinement of submicron and nanoscale particles, it also suffers from an inherently slow process due to the fact that particles are transported via Brownian motion. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technique for trapping particles, which has greatly enhanced trapping speed and efficiency. This method replaces thin film substrates with plasmonic resonant nanostructures and actually utilizes the collective heat generation capabilities of these nanostructures, which has been considered an undesirable byproduct in the past. By coupling the induced heating of the nanostructures with a low frequency AC electric field, strong microfluidic vortices are created that can rapidly transport suspended particles towards plasmonic nanoantennas where they are captured. This technology describes a way to achieve rapid particle transport, high throughput concentration, dynamic manipulation, and sorting of particles based on size while using less laser power and focusing. Advantages: -Greatly increases trapping speed -Requires less laser power and focusing -Sorts particles based on size Potential Applications: -Biosensing and lab-on-a-chip systems"
Cleansing of Surfactant-Coated Nanoparticles,"Cationic surfactants, such as cetrimonium bromide (CTAB), are important for the scalable synthesis of metal nanoparticles, but also cause problems in dispersion stability and toxicity in subsequent applications. The leaching of toxic CTAB into a medium can occur over several months. The removal and replacement of CTAB is difficult to do without compromising the quality of the nanoparticle dispersions. Practitioners in the field typically functionalize CTAB-coated nanoparticles by simple physisorption or chemisorption, followed by centrifugation or dialysis. However, these methods do not guarantee complete CTAB removal. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method to completely remove cationic surfactants, like CTAB, without causing any adverse effect on the nanoparticles. This method involves two main steps. First, the nanoparticles are purified through several cycles of filtration and redispersion in cleansing solutions, and then, the CTAB is replaced with citrate through the same process using a sodium citrate solution. The citrate now acts as the stabilizing agent for the nanoparticles in subsequent manipulations and functionalization. The process is scalable and effective for future nanoparticle manufacturing needs such as metal nanoparticles for nanomedicine applications. Advantages: -Completely removes cationic surfactants without damage to nanoparticles -Scalable for various manufacturing needs Potential Applications: -Cationic surfactant removal-Nanoparticle manufacturing-Nanomedicine"
kHz Frame Rate Confocal Imaging,"Confocal microscopy give researchers the ability to produce high-resolution, three-dimensional images of subjects as diverse as crystals, cells, and even the fluorescence of single molecules. Although confocal microscopes are a common tool used to generate static images, current instruments cannot capture fast processes such as chemical reactions. Further, confocal microscopy is difficult to use outside of the lab because the instrument must be isolated from vibrations while a sample is scanned. Purdue University researchers have designed a confocal microscope capable of capturing quantitative images with a frame rate on the scale of kHz, which is faster than the 30 Hz for current microscopy techniques. As opposed to the rectangular scan pattern used in other microscopes, the Purdue researchers' instrument captures pixels along a Lissajous curve whose geometry can be tuned by the user. This scan pattern requires much less time to capture an image. By coupling this scan pattern with image processing software, the potential for this approach is unlocked. For any given frame of a movie, the dark spots within the scan pattern can be statistically interpolated from the scanned pixels and the movement of the image over time. If a high-resolution still image is preferred, then individual frames are combined, like those in a panoramic photograph, to assemble the high-resolution image. In this way, both low-resolution movies and high-resolution stills can be captured from the same data set. This combination of Lissajous scan-pattern and software processing shows promise for faster detection of microscopic processes and is flexible enough to be extended for long-distance applications like lidar. Advantages: -Much faster frame rate than current confocal microscopes -Raw data can be used to generate high-resolution still image -Generation of a high-frame rate, lower-resolution moviePotential Applications:-Microscopy applications where movement distortion is a problem-Microscope use in exotic environments-Lidar telescopes-Scanned laser imaging"
Reagent for Measurement of Protein Phosphorylation by Gel Electrophoresis,"Research and Development labs (R&D) in academia, pharmaceutical, and biotech companies often assess the phosphorylation of a protein or classes of proteins. Currently, large-scale phosphorylation analysis is used to understand how signaling pathways work and how they may be deregulated in disease states. Even though thousands of protein phosphorylation sites can be identified, researchers may only be interested in a small sample of proteins for a signaling pathway. Hence, these large scale analysis techniques are time-consuming and cost-prohibitive. The applicability of gel-based proteomic strategy in phosphoproteomics has been largely limited by the lack of technologies for specific and quantitative detection of phosphoproteins in gels. To resolve these issues, researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel gel-based process, called Differential Gel Electrophoresis of Phosphoproteome (DiGEP). This process uses metal ions, such as Ti4+, Zr4+, Fe3+, and Ga3+, which are attracted to phosphate groups and attach fluorophores on the phosphoproteins. This ultimately helps visualize phosphorylation changes in different samples on the same gel. DiGEP analyses are advantageous because they enable the visualization of phosphoproteins on a single gel and select only relevant proteins for in-gel digestion and mass spectrometric analysis. It is highly specific, selective, and quantitative and can be used routinely in labs for quantitative phosphorylation measurement, in vitro kinase assay, kinase and phosphatase activity assay, kinase/phosphatase inhibitor screening, and detection of in vivo phosphorylation. Not only will this technology help a general biological laboratory to effectively measure changes in protein phosphorylation, but will also help pharmaceutical and biotech industries to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic agents relating to kinases. Advantages: -Visualization of phosphoproteins -Selection of proteins for spectrometric analysis -Effective and quantitative measures Potential Applications: -R&D labs-Disease research"
A Novel Method for Early Detection of Salmonella Contamination in Food Samples,"To prevent food-borne pathogens from spreading and helping with safety and health of a population, it is essential to have pathogen detection systems. It is difficult to process food samples and there is a need to use different types of enzymes for this process. Current technologies for detection include culture enrichment and microfiltration, which are not as efficient, and none of these technologies supply enzyme solutions for enriching food extracts with respect to background microorganisms.Purdue University researchers developed a product that won the grand prize in the 2014 FDA Food Safety Challenge - http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/purdue-university-innovation-wins-fda-food-safety-challenge.html. This new product of enzyme formulations and software for defining best conditions, using enzymes to treat food extracts. This product improves recovery of microorganisms and enhances rapid hollow tube microfiltration (in connection with a C3D instrument). It would allow matching enzymes to different food materials, identifying optimum conditions, and obtaining enhanced microbial recovery in order to analyze food microorganisms within four hours. This system would allow rapid concentration, retrieval, and discovery of pathogens that are present in various types of food. Due to the individual components of this technology, it has a 3- to 5-fold faster recovery of microorganisms, while concurrently minimizing the need for enrichment or selective culture that is usually used to obtain adequate cultures for pathogen detection.To view a video related to this technology, click this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdJSDPnmIfs&feature=youtu.be.Advantages: -Enhanced microfiltration-Faster process for analyzing microorganisms-Minimizes need for selective culturesPotential Applications:-Food industry-Food safety"
Improved BioCD Detects Molecular Structures in Samples,"In many chemical, biological, medical, and diagnostic applications, it is desirable to detect the presence of specific molecular structures in a sample.  Many molecular structures, such as cells, viruses, bacteria, toxins, and DNA fragments, are recognized by particular receptors.  One such technology for screening for a plurality of molecular structures is the so-called immunological compact disk, which simply includes an antibody microarray.  Current methodologies have proven useful thus far, but are often characterized by large surface areas per element, long interaction lengths, or complicated resonance structures.  Previously, a BioCD technology was developed to solve these problems, but it suffered from data that was corrupted by background noise.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an improved BioCD technology that allows for very accurate and fast scans of biological binding sites.  This technology makes possible a simple disk fabrication for spinning-disk immunoassays.  It also establishes a common global quadrature for the entire disk, as opposed to each array element establishing its own quadrature condition.  This will greatly facilitate disk fabrication with little or no effect of fabrication on the read fidelity.  The system also has 100 percent light detection efficiency and automatic compensation of laser intensity drift.  It can be implemented with differential encoding that directly subtracts out non-specific binding.Advantages:-Establishes global quadrature-100 percent light detection efficiency-Automatic compensation of laser intensityPotential Applications:-Biological structure detection"
Model for Predicting the Cloud Point of Biodiesels,"The use of biodiesel fuels is limited in cold climates by its tendency to crystallize, which blocks filters, clogs tanks, and generally restricts flow. The crystallization properties of biodiesel are directly related to the chemical composition of the fuel, which is not regulated. Since biodiesel fuels can be made from any fat source, the cloud point (onset of crystallization temperature) varies significantly. The cloud point of biodiesel fuels is a complex, non-linear function of composition of fatty acid methyl ester composition, making it difficult to predict. Currently, models for predicting the cloud point are based on statistical methods, which are based on data and measurements. These models are limited because they can only predict the behavior for those specific compositions. Purdue University researchers have developed a model that can accurately predict the cloud point of the mixture of fatty acid methyl esters according to their chemical composition. Since this model is not based on data or statistical methods, it clearly predicts the non-linear behavior of methyl ester mixtures. Advantages: -Not based on statistical methods, so it accurately predicts the cloud point of fatty acid mixtures -Predicts the cloud point of a mixture of biodiesel and petroleum diesel once chemical composition is knownPotential Applications:-Biofuel Manufacturers"
Simultaneous Identification of Multiple Pathogenic Organisms,"Immunodetection in microbiology, biosafety, and biosurveillance is very important for detecting and identifying potentially harmful pathogens. Currently, there are many methods of immunodetection, including traditional optical labeling, such as fluorescence and phosphorescence, and more recent developments using antibody-immobilized bacteria or bacteria bound to microfluidic chips that have been developed to increase optical signals, but many of these techniques are designed to identify a particular type of bacteria and do not allow for multiplexing or simultaneous detection of multiple bacterial species. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for simultaneous identification of multiple pathogenic organisms using heavy metal antibody tagging and plasma-based detection (MAPD). MAPD uses a traditional immuno-recognition approach, but is able to simultaneously detect and identify the presence of multiple antigens without requiring multiple, time-consuming experiments performed in parallel. This method offers fast and sensitive pathogen detection with minimal sample processing and preparation. The use of heavy metal tags generates a very low signal background, which allows MAPD to be used on a large subset of molecular targets that can be combined in a simple, low cost manner. Advantages: -Highly multiplexed classification of pathogens -Fast, sensitive detection with minimal sample processing and preparation -Low numbers of molecules of the target antibody can be measuredPotential Applications:-Microbiology-Biosafety-Biosurveillance"
Analysis of Microbial Colonies with Plate Sieve,"There is increasing use of technology and computers to document activity and growth of biological processes. The use of location algorithms to verify a bacterial colony on a plate allows a user to monitor colony growth over extended periods from hours to days. This would be fast and efficient in any research setting that utilizes bacterial colony identification systems. In need for such a system, researchers at Purdue University have developed a computer implemented technology that uses time stamps and location algorithms to identify bacterial colonies on a plate and locate the same colonies on subsequent timed data points for a rectangular plate. This software displays colonies and all colony light scatter patterns for that plate on the screen while identifying each colony on an image of the plate that is being viewed. By using a processor, areas in the first and second image would correspond to possible microbial colonies, and hence, a colony map is generated. There are currently no existing technologies that compare to this technology, making this beneficial and novel for research with microbial colonies. Advantages: -Use of time stamps and location algorithms -Efficient identification of colonies -Generation of colony mapsPotential Applications:-Research Labs-Medical/Health-Drug Development"
Super-Stable Encapsulated Gold Nanorods as Cancer Theranostics,"Gold nanorods (GNR) have potential uses as imaging agents or in cancer treatments because of their ability to be tuned to absorb or scatter various types of light. Gold particles could be injected into the body near a tumor and then heated with a light source to selectively kill the cancer cells. Unfortunately, current fabrication techniques create GNRs that are cytotoxic and breakdown quickly in a saline solution. To address this, researchers at Purdue University have developed a self-assembly process that encapsulates GNRs into block copolymer micelles. The resultant GNRs are stable against aggregation, even under physiological salt conditions, for indefinite periods of time. This method can be scaled up for mass production and can easily be extended to encapsulate and stabilize other nanoparticle agents.Advantages:-Stable for indefinite periods of time-Can be scaled for mass production-Encapsulate and stabilize other nanoparticle agentsPotential Applications-Manufacturing-Pharmaceuticals-Medical/HealthcareRelated Publications:Kim, Dae Hwan, et. al. Preparation of Super-Stable Gold Nanorods via Encapsulation into Block Copolymer Micelles. ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces. 2012, 4 (4), pp 1872–1877.DOI: 10.1021/am300198v."
Affinity Stabilization of Protein Drugs,"The development of protein drugs is often hindered by the instability of these large, complex molecules. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel method for stabilizing protein drugs based on ligand binding. The peptide epitopes are covalently linked to a biodegradable synthetic polymer, forming a pseudo-ligand. The pseudo-ligand binds to the protein drug with high affinity and helps to preserve near-native conformation, minimize unfolding, and prevent aggregation during manufacturing, shipping, and storage. Since the pseudo-ligand is comprised of a biodegradable polymer backbone and small peptide epitopes, it is expected to be biocompatible and nonimmunogenic. In some applications, it may be desirable to administer the protein drug in its free form. In such cases, the pseudo-ligand can be immobilized on a solid surface through a coupling agent and released prior to administration using a competing ligand.Advantages:-Preserves near-native conformation-Biocompatible and nonimmunogenicPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industryRelated Publications:Zhang, Jun, et al. Protein G, Protein A and Protein A-Derived Peptides Inhibit the Agitation Induced Aggregation of IgG. Molecular Pharmaceutics. 2012, 9 (3), pp 622–628.DOI: 10.1021/mp200548x."
Chemical Classification with Digital Compressive Detection,"Many applications in biology, medicine, manufacturing, and security require the rapid identification and quantification of chemical species within complex mixtures. Methods, such as hyperspectral imaging and monitoring of dynamic chemical processes paired with multivariate statistical techniques, are often used for chemical classification. One problem for high-speed chemical analysis is the time required to collect and analyze hyperspectral data. Purdue University researchers have developed a new strategy for rapid and accurate chemical classification. This strategy, digital compressive detection, can be used to classify substances with various degrees of spectral overlap. Digital compressive detection can also positively distinguish chemical species by detecting as few as 10 scattered photons, which could require as little as 30 microseconds. While previous strategies focused on minimizing spectral differences, digital compressive detection is optimized to minimize the error in the chemical classification. Advantages: -As few as 10 to 25 photons per measurement required for accurate classification -Optimized to minimize errorPotential Applications:-Biology-Drug development-Manufacturing"
Engineered Ribozyme to Introduce Unnatural Amino Acids into Proteins,"There are many biotechnology applications where it is necessary to introduce an unnatural amino acid at a specific location within a protein. Such modifications can be used to generate protein-protein interaction maps, track single molecules within cells, create reagents for use in biotechnology, or improve the pharmacokinetic properties of macromolecular therapeutics. Current technologies based on protein tRNA synthases are restricted by these enzymes' specificity for their amino acid substrates, limiting the amino acid substrates that can be used. To use these proteins within a cell, bio-orthogonal tRNA-synthase molecules that bind, recognize, and charge a foreign tRNA must be identified for each organism. RNA enzymes, ribozymes, capable of charging tRNAs with an activated amino acid have been identified; however, they are not capable of selecting and charging a single type of tRNA within a cell. To find a more efficient recognition system, researchers at Purdue University have engineered a ribozyme that can be readily programmed to recognize a specific tRNA and charge it with an unnatural amino acid. This ribozyme can be easily delivered to a cell via plasmid, along with its tRNA substrates. The ribozyme also accepts a wide variety of amino acid substrates.  Using a ribozyme catalyst instead of a protein catalyst, bypasses the need to translate an introduced gene within a cell. This technology has potential use in protein engineering as the charged tRNA products can be used to site-specifically introduce an unnatural amino acid into a protein sequence.Advantages:-Specifically charges tRNA with a wide variety of amino acids-Programmable tRNA selectivity-Easily delivered to cells-Bypasses translationPotential Applications:-Protein Engineering"
Electrostatic Control of DNA Melting Temperature,"Much of modern molecular biology is founded on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. PCR-based methods are used in DNA fingerprinting, cloning, phylogenetics, mutagenesis, analysis of gene expression, and numerous other biological studies. In traditional PCR, double stranded DNA is melted at high temperature, annealed at a lower temperature with short complimentary ""primer"" DNA, and copied by a polymerase enzyme starting at the primer. The cycle is repeated to generate a suitable amount of DNA for further use. PCR is still typically carried out by thermal cycling and still carried out in sealed tubes or sometimes within oil droplets to combat evaporation.Purdue University researchers have developed a technology that will allow PCR to be accomplished in sub-nanoliter-volume, oil-free droplets at a lower temperature. Positively-charged magnesium ions are typically included in a PCR reaction to stabilize the negatively-charged DNA. As opposed to melting DNA with heat, the Purdue researchers' technology applies an electrical bias to the droplet. The magnesium ions migrate towards the electrodes, and DNA is destabilized because the effective magnesium concentration is reduced. This technology can facilitate a lower-temperature, ion-controlled PCR reaction. Furthermore, the technology should also prove useful in related applications that rely on ion concentrations.Advantages: -Strengthens the interaction between analyte molecules and receptors-Does not require high temperature to melt DNA-Improves upon several biochemical sensing technologiesPotential Applications:-Early disease detection-Isoelectric protein separation-DNA related applications"
Targeted Therapeutic Against Bladder Cancer,"Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer among men and eleventh among women. Bladder cancer has a high rate of recurrence post-surgery. Despite its obvious high impact on public health, the available therapies are still of limited efficacy. Instillation of therapeutics in the lumen of the bladder assures access to the tumor without affecting normal cells, but dilution of the therapeutic agent by urine flow and its elimination by periodic emptying of the bladder, greatly reduces the treatment efficacy. The market for new technologies related to novel therapeutics to support the treatment of such cancers includes pharmaceutical companies and cancer research centers. Purdue University researchers have developed a novel strategy using an epidermal growth factor (EGF) targeted toxin, which can be used for elimination of both superficial and invasive bladder tumors. This is a highly efficient, targeted strategy that reduces treatment time from hours (current therapies) to minutes. Further, this agent can be administered by a pharmaceutically acceptable delivery system in the lumen of the bladder for treatment. In addition to being easily used against bladder cancer, this strategy is also applicable to other EGF receptor-dependent cancers such as lung and skin cancer. Advantages: -High efficacy and fast action -Targets superficial and invasive bladder tumors -EGF targeting and internalization of the toxinPotential Applications:-Bladder cancer treatment-Lung and Skin cancer treatmentInternational Journal of Cancer Research Article - https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijc.32719A Novel, Safe, Fast, Efficient Treatment for Her2-positive and Negative Bladder Cancer Utilizing an EGF-Anthrax Toxin Chimera.

Targeted Therapeutic for Bladder Cancer,"Bladder carcinomas are among the more frequent and highly recurrent cancers. In spite of its high impact on public health and its increasing burden to the health budget, available therapies are still of limited efficacy. Bladder instillation of nontargeted therapeutics is rendered inefficient by dilution of the agent by urine influx and elimination of the agent by the periodic voiding of the bladder content.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a family of artificial multivalent targeting peptides that show improved protein solubility/stability, greater binding potential, and a very high rate of uptake by tumor cells. This design is based on the strategies utilized by different bacteria, such as the therapeutically used Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), to bind and to be internalized by tumor cells without causing patient hypersensitivity, morbidity, and risk of infection.  Further, this technology has the potential for use as a targeting agent for the delivery of therapeutics to treat bladder cancer by having this technology formulated into pharmaceutically suitable carriers and administered into the lumen of the bladder. This revolutionizes bladder cancer treatment and can lead to therapeutic innovations in the treatment of other cancers such as skin and lung cancer.Advantages:-Greater protein stability, solubility, and tumor cell binding properties-Fast and efficient uptake by tumor cells-No infection risk or hypersensitivity developedPotential Applications:-Bladder cancer treatment-Potential skin and lung cancer treatmentRelated Publications:Coon, B.

Perforated MOS Structure for Single Biomolecule Detection,"Characterizing and sequencing single biomolecules, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, carbohydrates, etc., offers significant impact to science, medicine, and biotechnology. Single biomolecule detection has many benefits and could allow for early disease detection and screening, have pharmacological relevance, and help in understanding genetic information encoded in DNA. There are many proposed methods of studying single biomolecules, but they have several limitations. Many techniques require the isolation of the molecule prior to study, and most techniques are also limited by sample preparation, sensitivity, and specificity to specific categories of biomolecules. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for single biomolecule detection that allows for characterization and sequencing of biomolecules without the limitations of current nanochannel technologies. This method uses a metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensor with embedded, fluidic nanochannels. As a biomolecule moves through the nanochannel, a high frequency current is generated that contains information about the biomolecule, such as the type of nucleotides in the case of DNA/RNA, which can be used to sequence the molecule. This method does not have the problems associated with other nanopore techniques because it does not require the difficult drilling of extremely small nanopores, can detect four nucleotides at a time, and is not significantly affected by the rotation or position of the biomolecule in the nanochannel. Advantages: -Detection of single molecule or low concentration biomolecules, bio-polymers, RNAs, DNAs, carbohydrates, proteins, viruses, and virions -Lowers the cost of sequencing single molecule DNAs, RNAs, and carbohydrates -Addresses shortcomings of current nanochannel technologyPotential Applications:-Development of tools for early detection of a number of diseases and environmental hazards-Biomedical applications in diagnosis and therapy-Early detection of viruses-Study of carbohydrates-Genetics"
Tumor Detection/Treatment Model ,"Time and money are often wasted when using currently available cell culture models for initial phases of the development of drugs and detection tools. Currently, the best available cell culture models are hanging drops with tumor nodules or 3D monoculture of tumor nodules; however, the tumors in these models are not true representations of the disease due to a poorly replicated environment.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a disease-on-a-chip model to provide a better solution for this problem. This model reproduces the luminal portion of ductal systems. Tumors are grown in an environment that replicates the in vivo setting observed in human patients, providing a more accurate assessment of the of the tumor's sensitivity to drugs.  This model permits test drug targeting to the correct cells and side effects on the normal adjacent tissue at the same time.  In addition, this design can be used for automated tissue culture.   Advantages: -Tumors are grown in an in vivo-like environment-Could be sealed for high throughput-Provides a more accurate assessment of a tumor's sensitivity to various compounds-Performs two tests at once, i.e., drug targeting and side effectsPotential Applications:-Automated tissue culture-Drug targeting"
Novel Anticancer Compounds,"Natural product antitumor compounds, such as FR901464 and spliceostatin A, have particular interest in clinical applications due to their remarkable antitumor activity and effectiveness against human solid tumors. More significantly, both FR901464 and spliceostatin A potently inhibit in vitro splicing and promote pre-mRNA accumulation. The first total synthesis of FR901464 was accomplished in 29-41, which made the original methods time consuming and costly. In addition, it was difficult to produce a pure form of the compound. Researchers at Purdue University have developed concise, enantioselective syntheses of pure FR901464 and spliceostatin A, which can be accomplished in only 10 and 9 linear steps, respectively. By drastically decreasing the number of steps, this method is cost efficient, convergent, and amenable to the synthesis of structural variants. The researchers have already developed nine synthetic analogues, which are potentially more potent and bioactive, as well as synthesized several other high-quality, natural products such as jasplakinolide and lasonolide A. Advantages: -Efficient and cost effective -Amenable to the synthesis of structural variantsPotential Applications:-Pharmaceuticals-Drug development-Cancer treatment"
Miniature Ambient Ionization Mass Spectrometry System for Analysis of Microorganisms,"Electrospray ionization is regarded as the best-characterized and most efficient method for ionization of molecules in solution phase. There are three main stages in the process:  droplet formation, droplet evaporation, and ion formation. When a strong electric field is applied, a cone forms and a mist of small droplets is emitted from the tip. This method can produce small charged droplets under a low flow rate; however, the small size of the tip and the materials used causes problems with the source, the tip may become damaged or clogged easily. Other methods for overcoming clogging have been developed, but these methods still only work for pure chemicals dissolved in a solution. Purdue University researchers have developed a novel method to analyze a sample containing one or more microorganisms. The method involves applying the sample to a porous material, adding a solvent, injecting a high voltage to generate ions, and then expelling the ions from the porous material in order to analyze them with a mass or mini mass spectrometer. With this method, the sample does not need culturing or prepping prior to analysis; it can be done with a solid, liquid, or gas. This technology provides a way to identify the microorganism down to its subspecies, substrain, and/or isolate level. Advantages: -Biological samples can be stored in precut filter papers for months -Filter paper minimizes matrix effects and enhances the MS signal of chemicals in complex samples -Paper can be pretreated to contain internal standards that are released at certain points in quantitative analysisPotential Applications:-Chemical Analysis-Biotechnology"
"High-Speed Multispectral Discrimination Technology, Flow Cytometry","Current fluorescence intensity-based techniques are well-established in traditional screening methods that are used in diagnostic instruments. These methods rely on organic fluorochromes and emission band-detection systems. Although very powerful, they are restricted to approximately one dozen simultaneous fluorescent probes due to their design. Complex spectral compensation, complicated and numerous optics, and restricted spectral bandwidths make the current technology less efficient than desired. Purdue University researchers have developed a new technology that allows high speed analysis of single particles for classification. Characteristics of this technology include advanced spectral analysis, high speed detection, and single particle discrimination capabilities. The basic principles of flow cytometry, image collection systems, image analysis, and signal processing are utilized. This technology's advanced detectors, signal separation processes, and analytical processes combine to provide new opportunities for cellular classification systems, such as clinical pathology, analytical cytology, or advanced pharmaceuticals in cellular systems. Advantages: -High-speed detection of multiple labeling molecules and single particle discrimination capabilities -Reduces size and cost of systems -Allows greater versatility in fluorescent combinationsPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Diagnostics"
Topoisomerase I Inhibitors Substituted with Carbohydrates,"Topoisomerase I is an ideal protein to target to reduce cancer activity given it is expressed more often in cancer cells than most terminally differentiated cells. The enzyme is responsible for structural changes in the DNA protein complex, allowing enzymes easy access for DNA synthesis. Topoisomerases have an important role in regulation of the cell cycle, and when the enzyme is inhibited from completing its task, the cell will activate death pathways. Many anticancer drugs have been designed to target this protein as it is expressed in all proliferating cells, which is a common feature of transformed cells. The problem with the synthesized drugs is they are not easily metabolized by the body and their insolubility makes them difficult to develop in the laboratory, limiting bioavailability. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new topoisomerase I inhibitor that incorporates carbohydrate groups to increase solubility. The result is drug that is more bioavailable and stable, which comes with the added benefit of smaller doses acting more effectively. The synthetic route developed for these compounds is simple, versatile, and easily scalable. The newly synthesized compounds displayed potent anti-Top1 activity and ceased proliferation in transformed cells. Advantages: -Carbohydrate-substituted indenoisoquinolines overcome common problems of solubility with this drug class -Topoisomerase I is a proven target for cancer therapyPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthercare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-Cancer Treatment"
7-Azaindenoisoquinolines as Anticancer Agents,"Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) is an important protein found in the cell; it is used to unwind and reduce torsional stress on DNA during replication. TOP1 inhibitors are a useful chemotherapy agent because cells that are constantly dividing, such as cancer cells, are much more susceptible to attack; cell death will occur when topoisomerase 1 is inhibited. TOP1 inhibitors make up a large portion of the chemotherapy market because they can be used to target a wide variety of proliferating tumors. The characteristic of uninhibited division is a common feature in cancer that can be targeted without needing a specific marker for each cancer cell type. As more information becomes readily available, it is becoming apparent that within tumors there is a heterogeneous population of cells populating the primary tumor and the secondary tumors.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a series of 7-azaindenoisoquinoline derivatives that act to inhibit topoisomerase and subsequently induce cell death. This new class of topoisomerase inhibitors has the potential to possess enhanced chemical stability over traditional inhibitors, while increasing inhibitor effectiveness. Advantages: -Azaindenoisoquinolines have enhanced chemical stability and effectiveness over other TOP1 inhibitors -TOP1 is a proven target for cancer therapyPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Cancer Treatment"

Purdue University researchers have developed a novel process for synthesizing four TOP1 inhibitors and have optimized their structures for the greatest inhibitory activity and cytoxicity towards dividing cells. The compounds consist of 7-, 8-, 9-, and 10-azaindenoisoquinoline structures. Advantages: -TOP1 is a proven target for cancer therapy -Azaindenoisoquinolines have enhanced chemical stability and effectiveness over other TOP1 inhibitors"
Tracking Cellular Internalization and Trafficking of Nanomaterials,"Understanding how drugs and viruses enter cells is paramount for better drug efficacy and for designing more targeted drugs to combat infection. Currently, traditional molecular biology techniques are used to understand the passage of a molecule from the outside of the cell to the cytoplasm. While these techniques offer a great starting point to understanding key proteins involved in transport, they only provide a snapshot of a specific interaction and miss other biomolecules that are involved in intermediate steps. Purdue University researchers have developed a multifunctional reagent to study cellular transport of molecules. The novel reagent will interact with multiple proteins necessary for transport into the cell and the resulting conjugates identified by mass spectrometry. At varying times, cellular proteins can be isolated to identify the proteins the reagent is bound to, giving investigators a better understanding of what is involved in cellular transport. Advantages:-Information to design more efficacious drugs-Learn more detailed information about cellular transport-Design more targeted drugs to treat infectionPotential Applications:-Bioinformatics-Pharmaceuticals-Chemical analysis-Drug developmentRelated Publications:Wang, Linna, et al. Time-Resolved Proteomic Visualization of Dendrimer Cellular Entry and Trafficking. Journal of the American Chemical Society. 2015, 137 (40), pp 12772–12775.DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5b07875."
HPTP Phosphatase in Cancer,"The function of protein tyrosine phosphatases and their role in cancer have been recognized for several years. In general, these phosphatases negatively regulate the oncogenic function of certain kinases by reversing pro-malignant modification of critical signaling proteins, including the kinases themselves. Notably, many solid tumors are associated with unphosphorylated EphA2. EphA2 is a tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed and functionally altered in malignant cells. The lack of cytoplasmic phosphorylation causes EphA2 to promote malignant cell growth, invasion, and survival. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment using a human protein tyrosine phosphatase (HPTP). HPTP is overexpressed in these aggressive cancer cells and has been shown to target EphA2 and other Eph receptors. In cell-based studies, HPTP overexpression has been demonstrated to be sufficient to cause malignant transformation. Thus, inhibitors of HPTP hold potential for targeting the large number of cancers that are associated with unphosphorylated Eph receptors. Advantages: -Identifies an important oncoprotein, HPTP -Suggests novel therapeutic approaches for certain cancers involving HPTP targeting and inactivation, which would reduce HPTP activity in cancerous cellsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Cancer Detection-Cancer Treatment"
Synthesis of Novel Anticancer Agent Peloruside A,"Peloruside A (1), a 16-membered macrolide antitumor agent, was first isolated by L. West and P. Northcote from the New Zealand marine sponge, Mycale hentscheli.  It has shown potent antitumor activity against resistant cell lines, such as P388 murine leukemia cells with an IC50 value of 10 ng/mL. Peloruside A is a microtubule stabilizing agent operating with a similar mechanism to the most widely used anticancer agent, taxol, and has shown a synergistic effect with taxol itself. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a process for synthetic production of Peloruside A, which is amenable to the development of analogs and derivatives of this important molecule. This synthetic strategy opens the possibility of creating unnatural analogs of Peloruside A with improved potency, bioavailability, and other pharmacokinetic properties. These developments will facilitate drug discovery for cancer treatment. Advantages: -Novel synthetic pathway to highly potent cancer drug -Synthetic process amenable to drug discovery of improved therapeuticsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-Cancer Treatment"
Affinity Capture Materials for Protein Structural Analysis,"Currently, it is difficult to isolate a protein sample that is pure and maintains its native conformations for structural analysis. Knowing the shape of a protein helps to understand the function and how it interacts with other proteins and nucleotides. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a material to capture proteins from crude samples that has high affinity for the specified protein and low non-specific binding giving a very low background. This device can be developed into a commercially available grid that can be used in electron microscopy experiments that avoids non-specific binding and gives scientists straightforward analysis of protein structures. Obvious applications include high-dilution sampling, viral concentrations in hospitals, protein function experiments in laboratories, and protein sampling from crude sources.Advantages:-High affinity for specific protein-Low background interference from non-specific proteins-Protein maintains native conformationPotential Applications:-Biotechnology"
Implantable Wireless Glucose Sensor,"Type 1 diabetes afflicts approximately one million people living in the United States and 10 to 20 million people worldwide. Caused by the body's inability to produce its own insulin to regulate blood glucose levels, type 1 diabetes can cause a wide variety of complications and requires careful monitoring of glucose levels and insulin injections. The most common way to monitor blood glucose levels is with a finger stick, which measures glucose at a point in time, potentially missing important fluctuations, such as sudden hypoglycemic episodes. The most effective way to measure glucose levels is to monitor it continuously in a way that it could be recorded and tracked. To accomplish this, various monitor designs have been proposed, including several designs for implantable sensors, but most require an internal power supply or make use of potentially dangerous enzymes. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new design for an implantable glucose monitor that requires no internal power and has a fast reaction time to changes in glucose levels. This device uses a glucose sensitive ferrogel, which grows and shrinks based on the level of glucose present. This device is expected to have an area no larger than one cubic centimeter and once implanted into the body's soft-tissue, the ferrogel's change in size can be detected wirelessly, providing a continuous measurement of glucose levels.Advantages:-Device requires no internal power supply-Fast reaction time to changes in glucose levels-Provides continuous measurement of glucose levelsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceutical industry"
Detection of Contaminants in Water,"Ammonia at elevated concentrations is poisonous to different organisms. For examples, 22.8 ppm can be lethal to water organisms and exposure to ammonia as low as 35 ppm for over 15 minutes can be dangerous to humans. Therefore, a continuous, online ammonia monitoring system is highly desired, especially for dynamic aqueous water delivery systems. Various electrochemical, catalytic, and optical fiber sensors have attracted substantial attention for the monitoring of ammonia in gaseous phase given they provide an easy and fast means of continuous detection. The majority of the fiber optic ammonia sensor research efforts have been focused on the employment of Glass Optical Fiber (GOF) sensors, which primarily focuses on the detection of ammonia in the gaseous phase such as in air. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel technique for the fabrication of Plastic Optical Fiber (POF) sensors that are ideal for monitoring water delivery systems. POF sensors are more flexible and stronger mechanically than GOF sensors, and POF sensors are a more suitable choice for applications that require the use of long optical fibers, such as monitoring ammonia in the artificial water delivery systems. This fabrication technique is inexpensive, reliable, sensitive, and reversible. Advantages: -Good reversibility -Compact, lightweight, and relatively inexpensive -Immune to electromagnetic interferencePotential Applications:-Ammonia monitoring in artificial water delivery systems"
Sensitive Folate Receptor Detection by Immunomagnetic Diffractometry,"Despite the diversity of available malignant disease detection platforms, important challenges still remain in minimizing sensor size, reducing detection time, eliminating target-labeling requirements, minimizing signal amplification steps, and developing simple and inexpensive fabrication protocols.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an integrated approach for the rapid detection of the folate receptor (FR) using in situ assembled optical diffraction gratings in combination with immunomagnetic capture. With this approach, a detection sensitivity of 700 fM (20 pg/ml) was achieved without any fluorescent or radiolabels or any secondary signal amplification. This approach can be applied to other targets and has the potential to be a broadly applicable, highly sensitive analysis technique. Advantages:-Allows early detection of cancer-Sensitive to femtomolar concentrations-Simpler assay with lower detection limit compared to current standardPotential Applications:-Cancer Detection-Medical/Healthcare"
Peptide Silane Material,"Extracellular environments and signaling provides clues to the cellular mechanisms used to modulate cell development and differentiation. Biologically inspired materials to manipulate cellular differentiation are a potentially powerful tool for the development and implementation of many cell-based technologies, including automated cell culture, cell therapies, and cell fate or functioning in prosthetics and implantable devices. This technology is a material platform capable of integrating a more complex pattern of signals in space and in future work/time.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a simple ""one pot"" method of producing a peptide silane material that allows the presentation of multiple peptides at controllable relative concentrations. The material can support cell growth directly at the surface without the addition of soluble factors. This material can provide rich biological signals that are well defined, and cells can be induced to possess more mature phenotypic characteristics than a traditional two-dimensional culture. The material methods have been developed, and the materials have been synthesized and characterized for multiple peptides. A neuronal model system has been demonstrated and validated with the rat neuronal cell line. Additional material formulations have been designed that produce a more neuronal phenotype that has enhanced neurotransmitter production and release compared to control culture surfaces.Advantages:-Synthetic brain model-Functionalized for well-known rat cell line-Simple synthesisPotential Applications:-Biotechnology"
Microsensor Arrays for Bacterial Detection,"Concerns about biological warfare have piqued interest in sensitive detection of microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria. One method for detection of bacteria is to use the naturally occurring antibody-antigen chemistry to trap the bacteria onto a patterned substrate. Patterning the antibody into a microarray helps facilitate detection through a multitude of possible pattern recognition algorithms.Purdue University researchers have developed a new method for multi-threat bacterial detection that is rapid, economical, and offers the potential for mass production. They have extended the microarray concept from the field of proteomics to biohazard detection. This method incorporates an immunological assay platform capable of reagent free, real-time antibody based detection of a wide variety of aqueous borne biocontaminants. The immunological complex formation can be sensed directly using an array of submicron sensing elements, and thereby, permitting multiple-threat detection capabilities. It is anticipated that upon insertion of a biochip into a handheld device, a positive identification of biohazard will occur in real time.Advantages:-Multiple-threat detection capability-Positive biohazard identification in real timePotential Applications:-Biotechnology-Biosensors"
Second Generation Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors,"A type of mutated constitutively active protein, Ras, is seen in a significant number of cancers. There is a great deal of interest in preventing the Ras protein from localizing on cell membranes as an anticancer treatment. One way to prevent localization is to inhibit farnesyltransferase (FTase), the enzyme responsible for facilitating Ras attachment to the cell membrane. Traditional FTase inhibitors are highly charged and incapable of traversing the cell membrane to enter the cell. Purdue University researchers have developed a strategy for intracellular delivery of the monophosphates of such FT inhibitors, which could provide an effective therapeutic approach. Advantages: -Intracellular delivery of inhibitors -Enables absolute quantification of known compounds and relative quantification of unknown compounds in most cases using a single liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) runPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Cancer Treatment-Biotechnology"
Designer Collagen Fibers for Tissue Engineering Applications,"Collagen holds organs in place, binds cells together, confers appropriate mechanical properties for tissues, and provides a framework for the body. The ubiquitous influence of collagen makes it an attractive target for implantable and regenerative tissue systems; however, the use of natural collagen in tissue engineering applications is limited due to difficulty with precise control of scaffold structures. Furthermore, natural collagen aggregates are inherently inconsistent, complicating precise introduction of biomolecules such as growth factors and cell adhesion agents. Synthetic collagen alleviates these problems, but there is still a need to control the 3D architecture of collagen networks. Purdue University researchers have incorporated metal binding sites into small collagen peptides and used metal-ligand interactions to drive aggregation. Self-assembly of 3D structures is spontaneous, highly reproducible, and reversible. Fine, nanoscale detail and ultimate control at the single molecular level give rise to tunable shapes, sizes, and tertiary structures. Physical properties, such as mechanical strength, tensile strength, and porosity, may be modified in a predetermined way, as the physical properties of collagen play a central role in cell growth and differentiation. Reversibility of collagen aggregates, whereby aggregates are converted back to smaller subunits, may be advantageous for controlled release of drugs, cells, growth factors, etc. With aggregate structures so diverse, including spheres, nanospheres, hollow spheres, meshes, cages, microflorettes, fibers, and sheets, these designer synthetic collagen aggregates find applications across the spectrum. Advantages: -Control of 3D structure of collagen networks -Excellent biocompatibility and bioactivityPotential Applications:-Biotechnology-Materials"
Selective Capture and Identification of Bacteria,"Rapid identification of infectious pathogens is crucial in limiting the spread of contagious diseases. Unfortunately, current tests for most pathogens require hours or days of processing time. Antibody-based detection strategies have shown faster testing times, but become obsolete when the pathogen mutates its antibody binding sites. With the emergence of increasingly virulent strains of common pathogens, there is a need for new strategies with rapid turnaround times and the ability to detect mutated strains.Purdue University researchers have developed a novel technique for selective capture and identification of pathogenic bacteria using immutable ligands. These are pathogen-specific ligands that the disease-causing organism must bind to in order to remain virulent. Examples of immutable ligands include host cell surface molecules that the pathogen must bind to in order to infect its host and nutrient molecules that the microbe must internalize to survive. This method first immobilizes the immutable ligand onto a chip. When the chip is exposed to its matching pathogen, binding occurs. The chip can then be quantitatively evaluated using image processing algorithms, which are not only fast and accurate, but can also be used in a multiplex approach where a sample can be screened for a wide variety of pathogens simultaneously.Advantages:-Rapid multiplex test results-Detection invulnerable to pathogen mutationsPotential Applications:-Biotechnology-Toxin Detection-Medical/Healthcare"
Manipulator for Precise Interaction with Microscale Objects,"Micromanipulators, devices used to physically interact with samples under a microscope, are expensive and often require complicated piezoelectric systems or hydraulics for precise 3-D positioning of very small objects. These parameters limit the number of users and the availability of this technology, which is increasingly important for biomedical and engineering fields. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a mechanical micromanipulator that allows for precise gripping, positioning, and releasing of microscale objects without external power. This technology utilizes customized, disposable, silicon tweezer heads attached with a specially designed interface to a standard laboratory rotational input-translational output micrometer. Prongs in varying sizes can be used to manipulate different sized micro objects for specific end purposes. For example, the tweezer head can be treated with a biological entity, e.g., virus or DNA, and then brought into surface contact with cells under study, effectively implanting the biological entity within the cells. This micromanipulator operates with purely manual actuation, is simple to assemble and use, and therefore, provides accessible microscale manipulation technology for a wide range of disciplines including traditional engineering, biological engineering, and medicine. The device enables accuracy and sensitivity while eliminating complex and costly motors, amplifiers, and power supplies. Advantages: -Provides accuracy and sensitivity for microscale manipulation using only manual actuation -Cost effective and simple to assemble and use, utilizing standard micrometers -Requires no external power, wires, amplifiers, or electricity	Potential Applications:-Imaging-Microtechnologies-Nanotechnologies-Devices"
Improved Retroviruses for Gene Therapy,"Transducing cells with viral vectors to deliver novel nucleic acids requires a specific ligand or envelope glycoprotein on the virus surface to bind to a receptor on a target cell.  By changing the ligand on the virus (pseudotyping), it is possible to enhance the transduction efficiency towards target cell types.  For this technology, Ebola glycoprotein-pseudotyped retroviruses were produced for gene transduction into the lung and other tissues and for the study of Ebola virus entry into cells. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology that allows quantitative measurement of virus entry into host cells and determination of the effectiveness of reagents that inhibit entry.  This technology also allows for the production of Ebola glycoprotein-pseudotyped retroviruses with markedly improved titers, making the practical use of such viruses more feasible. Advantages:- Allows gene therapy of the lung using pseudotyped retroviruses- Improved safety and efficiencyPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-Antivirals-Gene/Cell Therapy"
Quantification of Affinity-Selected Glycopeptides,"Combinations of glycopeptides and glycoproteins are used in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of diseases and their causes in clinical, diagnostic, and discovery medicine. With some exceptions, current tests generally lack the necessary sensitivity and specificity for early and accurate diagnosis. Researchers at Purdue University have proposed an application of glycoprotein technology that greatly increases the specificity and sensitivity of serum tests for many types of cancer and other diseases. This novel method is used for stable isotope labeling and affinity selection of glycopeptides to identify serum glycoprotein changes. In addition to diagnosing and monitoring diseases, this method may also uncover novel targets for the development of therapeutics. Advantages: -Sensitive enough to detect cancers without biomarkers -Less complex and more sensitive than other methodsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug development-Drug targeting and screening"
Internalization of Anticancer Cargo by Bladder Tumor Cells,"Bladder cells are well protected and particularly difficult for topically applied therapeutic agents to penetrate.  Constant urine influx and periodic voiding of the bladder further limits the effectiveness of therapy.  Currently, instillation of live Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is most commonly used to increase penetration of therapeutic agents in the treatment of bladder cancer; however, administration of BCG is associated with high local morbidity and the potential for systemic infection.  There is a need for the development of safer, less toxic approaches to administer therapy.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an effective strategy to promote the internalization of anticancer cargo using the fibronectin attachment protein (FAP) from BCG to gain admittance to bladder tumor cells.  FAP binds strongly to targets on the surface of bladder tumor cells; it is subsequently internalized along with the chemotherapeutic cargo.  To combat the transitory nature of bladder contents, an antibody-induced microaggregation strategy is employed that promotes rapid internalization of FAP by bladder tumor cells.  Furthermore, FAP binding on the surface of bladder tumor cells is resistant to the acidic environment of the bladder.  These properties make it an excellent foundation for the design of more effective, less toxic bladder cancer therapies.Advantages:-High-affinity targeting of bladder tumor cells-Rapid internalization-Binding is resistant to the acidic environment of the bladderPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug development-Biotechnology"

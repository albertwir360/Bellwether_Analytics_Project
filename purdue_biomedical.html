{'Bone Fracture Repair by Targeting of Bone Anabolic Agents': 'Current research on healing bone fractures either focuses on localized application of a nontargeted bone anabolic agent or a systematic administration of a nontargeted bone anabolic agent that have off-target effects. Both methods lack the desired efficiency and effectivity to treat bone fractures.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a targeted bone anabolic agent capable of accelerated fracture healing. By using a construct that self-assembles into micelles, the technology targets bone fractures to a greater extent than healthy bone, releases drug under physiological conditions, and accelerates fracture healing. This technology utilizes a nontoxic acidic oligopeptide that increases accumulation of the drug in fractures, reduces the accumulation in healthy tissue, and uses a cleavable linker to extend the release of the drug in the fracture site, resulting in faster fracture healing.Advantages-Nontoxic acidic oligopeptide increases accumulation of the drug in fractures and decreases drug accumulation in healthy tissue.

The setup is compatible with multi-well plates and allows for high throughput, thereby reducing the time needed to develop targeted cancer therapies. Cancer treatment screening typically involves use of a synthetic polymer-based substrate, which leads to undesired defects in cell cultures. These polymer substrates are controlled by electromechanical forces that do not accurately replicate natural cell environments. However, Purdue researchers have used magnetic actuators that are adaptable in both amplitude and frequency to apply specific strain that accurately suspends cells over a gap between actuators. In testing with 18,000 cells, within 24 hours a cell culture was ready to be studied.

In addition, the device uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to compare results with a deep learning database to pinpoint lesions. Currently, pupillometers are only adapted to check one eye at a time, but often there can be damage to a consensual reflex that goes unnoticed. Purdue researchers have fine-tuned their pupillometer to feature a telecentric lens that enhances biodynamic image acquisition and thereby allows optometrists to obtain highly accurate measurements for reliable diagnostics.

The neural networking technique utilizes information typically ignored in AI, including optically analyzing single molecules directly from image content. Currently, deep neural networks (DNN) are used to measure single molecules by rotating a double helix point spread function (PSF) or implementing Gaussian models, which requires complex mapping to connect input with output, and depends on domain expertise. The Purdue University approach instead relies on a network architecture that recognizes inherent information from images at a rate of one million PSFs for each task. In addition, this technology can accurately distinguish one hundred to three hundred sub-regions on average, which is equivalent to twenty to sixty raw data frames. Key features of a single molecule such as location, orientation, and wave-front distortion can now be obtained with ease.

Cardiovascular health is typically measured by echocardiogram (ECG) to measure electrical activity in the heart or photoplethysmography (PPG) that measures changes in blood volume in the peripheral microvasculature; however, these technologies can often be invasive to patients and have not yet been adapted into wearables for personalized on-demand monitoring. TENGs with PVA blend contact layers produce fast readout with distinct peaks for blood ejection, blood reflection in the lower body, and blood rejection from the closed aortic valve, which may enable detection of common cardiovascular diseases such as cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, and ischemic heart disease. In addition, PVA has some unique advantages over other materials used in TENGS such as starch, chitosan, lignin, or polyamides because it is biocompatible, water-soluble, and costs three to four times less on average. Purdue researchers have characterized optimal compositions of PVA on gelatin composite films using proton and carbon NMR to verify molecular structure, dynamic light scattering (DLS) to test coil size reduction and select the best percent by weight of PVA, and finally analyzing dielectric constants of various blends to enhance their energy harvesting capability. In testing with a copper-based band worn on the wrist, these devices show accuracy in measuring the average human pulse as 76 beats per minute.

HSC transplantation is an important therapeutic option for many blood diseases, cancers and immunodeficiencies, replacing diseased blood cell populations. However, HSCs are currently in short supply as they are typically extracted from humans. The Purdue University researchers have responded to this need by developing a serum-free, in vitro directed differentiation protocol to generate human HSCs from pluripotent stem cells. These HSCs have been proven capable of generating white and red blood cell progeny. In further validation of this technology, the HSCs implanted into zebrafish embryos colonized the hematopotietic tissues of the growing chimeric fish.

Treatment requires the implantation of shunts through which CSF can be drained from the brain.  However, the failure rate of these systems remain high, especially among children. According to the Journal of Neurosurgery, a study conducted from April 2008 to December 2011 reported that 33% out of 1036 patients experienced shunt failure. Common causes of failure include obstruction, over-drainage, and loculated ventricles.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an implantable catheter capable of obstruction detection and removal, device alignment, and flow rate measurement. Previously, Purdue researchers introduced a fully integrated self-clearing implantable catheter that was able to clear obstructions, but found that once the device was implanted it was impossible to determine whether the device was oriented properly or actuating as expected. With new additions, in real-time the catheter can detect obstructions, confirm device alignment, and measure the CSF flow-rate on top of the existing biofouling-removal capabilities of the microactuator in the catheter. This device has demonstrated the ability to solve one of the largest challenges that clinicians encounter with chronically implanted catheters.

The ability to distinguish between high and low frequencies allows for faster user response, easing every day conversations as well as patient lifestyles. Hearing aids have been adapted to lower frequency through Hybrid Expansive Frequency Compression (hEFC) methods; however, hEFC technology often confuses between high and low frequencies. In addition, hEFC based systems cannot filter background noise and rarely recognize soft sounds like frication. Often, individuals with high frequency hearing loss will start to rely on memory of sounds, which leads to misidentification of phonemes. Purdue University has integrated new technology into hearing aids that keeps different sounds separate and enhances fricatives, affricates, and stop constant barriers.

HA-MRSA tends to be the result of invasive procedures, e.g. device implantation. The latter, CA-MRSA, is spread through skin-to-skin contact, typically beginning as a painful boil. In addition, MRSA is considered to be even more life-threatening if combined with sepsis or necrotizing pneumonia. Because MRSA is drug-resistant, there is need for a method of prevention and elimination of the infection. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a drug-free approach to eliminating MRSA.

Likewise, companies within the food and life sciences industry are constantly concerned with contaminant detection in products. The current standard for detecting biological analytes is by the CyTOF method. In this method, samples are collected, then mixed with metal conjugated antibodies, and finally loaded into a mass cytometer. Once inside the cytometer, the metal ionizes which allows the analyte-metal conjugated antibody complex to be detected. Whilst, this system is great at detecting multiple analytes, it has several disadvantages including: samples requiring time-consuming extensive preparation and the use of the cytometer, which is a large device costing $700,000. This has created an unfulfilled need for a portable system that can quickly analyze the contents of a sample.Researchers at Purdue have developed an instrument that can rapidly detect 15 or more analytes in a sample at once. This instrument is a similar to CyTOF in that metal conjugated antibodies are used to detect analytes. In contrast, samples are loaded into an absorbent strip with no sample preparation needed. The strips are then exposed to a laser and results are available within 15 minutes of loading the sample.

Medical professionals have an increasing interest in ways to decrease the risk of infection and eliminate the damage of healthy tissue near the surgical site. Surgical sealants are a promising technology that could hold incisions closed without mechanical support of sutures or staples. There are a few commercially available surgical sealants. Commercially available surgical sealants have poor elasticity and adhesive strength and, therefore, require mechanical support. A strong and elastic surgical sealant would not require additional support. A first generation sealant have addressed the elasticity problem with the development of their first generation surgical sealant.Recently, researchers at Purdue University have modified their their first generation surgical sealant to improve its adhesive strength. The adhesive strength was higher for the second generation in comparison to the first generation surgical sealant on pig skin at physiological conditions.

It is hypothesized by scientists that glutamate excitotoxicity is a secondary injury that can occur after spinal cord injury (SCI). The limited knowledge of the role of glutamate in secondary injury has limited the development of therapeutics for GE. In 2016, the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center reported 300,000 people currently live with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States. SCI is a debilitating illness that often leaves patients with limited mobility. The lifetime healthcare cost per patient can range from $1,200,000 to $5,000,000 per patient. Current bioanalytical techniques such as nuclear resonance imaging have low spatiotemporal resolution and poor sensitivity for determining glutamate levels. Since glutamate excitotoxicity is dynamic in nature and can progress over time, it is crucial that the glutamate diagnostic tools possess high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity of glutamate.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a biosensor with superior sensitivity for measuring glutamate levels in hopes to better understand GE. In in vitro studies, it was found that the newly developed biosensor exhibited 6 times higher glutamate sensitivity in comparison to glutamate biosensors fabricated in other labs.

To combat infections it is essential to detect bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics in the early stages of infection to reduce undesirable use of antibiotics.  Current methods for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) require 16 hours at a minimum to complete, can only analyze specific bacteria, among other limitations. Therefore, a rapid method for detecting bacteria and profiling their antibiotics response is needed for infectious disease treatment.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a metabolic imaging method to monitor activity in live bacteria. This system incorporates a culture-free environment and can determine antibiotic susceptibility of general bacteria within nearly one cell cycle by monitoring metabolic activity at the single cell level. AST time required using this method is reduced from at least 16 hours for conventional culture based systems to around 30 minutes. AST at the single bacterium level is especially useful for nonculturable or fastidious bacteria; metabolic activity happens faster than phenotypic growth, meaning that antibiotic susceptibility can be determined before the bacteria has the chance to replicate. This system would likely be used in laboratories and hospitals to assign the correct antibiotics to fight infections.

Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a promising non-invasive sample for glucose monitoring purposes due to its highly controlled physiological regulation. However, this may reduce reliability because the concentration of glucose is diluted by additional water vapor and the inclusion of anatomical dead space air, causing a wide range of reported EBC glucose concentrations.  By selectively collecting only exhaled breath that has been exchanged with lung fluid, it is anticipated that a greater fraction of glucose can be collected in the condensate.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an automated and selective exhaled breath condenser for glucose monitoring. This is the first condenser of its kind to actually separate and exclude dead space air from lung fluid-exchanged air. The condensate collected from this device provides a robust sample for evaluating glucose concentrations without variable dilution factors from dead space condensate that could impact the reliability of the sample.Advantages: -Separates/excludes dead space air from lung fluid-exchanged air-Provides robust sample for glucose concentration evaluation-Improves reliability of glucose samplesPotential Applications: -Glucose monitoring-Glycemic control-Diabetes treatment', 'Intravascular Photoacoustic Tomography Assessment of Lipid Content in Arteries': 'Photoacoustic imaging is a biomedical imaging modality based on the use of laser-generated ultrasound.

There are an estimated 3.4 million Americans, including 470,000 children, living with epilepsy. Approximately 30% of seizures cannot be controlled by medication, and uncontrolled seizures are the primary risk factor for SUDEP. The exact cause of SUDEP is unknown, but laryngospasm has been proposed as a potential cause; therefore, there is a need for research to explore the causes of laryngospasm. Researchers at Purdue University have developed research into the causes of laryngospasms and its link with epilepsy. This research confirmed that sudden death due to laryngospasm in the kainic acid model of epilepsy is always preceded by a certain mechanism, and a method to eliminate sudden death has also been developed. This knowledge may inform future research into sudden death epilepsy and may contribute to the hypothesis that has been presented. This mechanism may be important in other mechanisms of sudden death.Advantages: -Elimination of SUDEP-Inform future research-Important for other mechanisms of sudden deathPotential Applications: -SUDEP-Layngospasm', 'Self-Clearing Glaucoma Drainage Device': 'Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in the world. The eye disorder has no cure, and can only be treated via pharmaceutical or surgical intervention with varying degrees of success. Implantable glaucoma drainage devices have grown in popularity over the past years, but the reliability of these implants is poor; only about 50% of the devices are still operational after five years. The lack of reliability is generally due to accumulation of microorganisms during and after implantation.Researchers at Purdue University have invented a new glaucoma drainage device that combats the problem of biofouling. Using new advancements in technology, the device is "Smart," and is able to clear itself of harmful bio-buildup. It is also able to functionally manage intraocular pressure (IOP) due to the variable flow resistance of glaucoma drainage device (GDD). These improvements allow for a more reliable, yet safe and comfortable implant for treating glaucoma.Advantages:-Self-clearing-Control of IOP pressuresPotential Applications:-Glaucoma treatment', 'Novel Gene Delivery Method': 'In the current versions of bovine adenoviral vector system, only .6 kb deletion of the E1 region can be made in the bovine cell line.  Various versions of less prevalent human adenoviral vectors are tested for gene delivery and vaccine production.  The problem with these current versions is that they do not provide the best immune responses.  They are also not as efficient as they could be.  There is a need for a new technology that allows for better responses and increases the efficiency of adenoviral vector mediated gene delivery.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that supports the replication of bovine adenoviral vector with full E1 region deleted.  This allows foreign gene cassette capacity in the bovine adenoviral vector to be extended by 2kb.  Such deletion would allow for a much greater insert capacity of the foreign gene cassette containing one or more genes.  This new technology could potentially open the door for many new technologies pertaining to adenoviral vector mediated gene delivery and vaccine production.Advantages: -Provides better responses-More efficientPotential Applications: -Gene delivery-Adenoviral vectors-Gene therapy', 'Multiscale Microdevices for Antifouling Sensing and Drug Delivery': 'Microscale sensors and drug delivery devices often suffer from functional degradation due to biofouling. Biofouling is one of the most recognized challenges in developing chronically functional devices for marine and implantable applications. This problem has been addressed by the use of coating; however, coatings lose functionality over time. Other passive antifouling mechanisms are often toxic, short-term solutions. A more reliable and long-lasting solution might improve the reliability and performance of implantable sensors and drug delivery devices.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an antifouling solution for large, nonplanar optical surfaces. This technology is a device for marine or implantable applications that has nested multiscale features for active and passive anti-biofouling strategies. By combining active and passive anti-biofouling mechanisms, this device will provide long-term protection against biofouling for over 10 years, extending the lifetime of self-clearing marine or implantable sensors.Advantages: -Remove protein, bacteria, and cellular-level biofilms-Extend lifetime of self-clearing marine/implantable sensors-Insights on progression of various chronic diseasesPotential Applications: -Marine/implantable sensors-Neural interfaces-Inflammation, restoration, and therapeutics', 'Martina: A Breastfeeding Simulation System': "Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce diabetes, obesity, and respiratory infections.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that mother's breastfeed their babies for six months.  Today, only 11.9 percent of babies are breastfed for this long. The main reason for this is mothers feel discomfort during breastfeeding.  Sore breasts and bleeding nipples are causing mothers to stop breastfeeding early and use formula.  Using formula is also a financial burden.  By breastfeeding, families could save $1200 to $1500 over the six month period.  There is a need for a way for mothers to properly learn how to breastfeed.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that can teach mothers the correct technique of breastfeeding to avoid the discomfort.  This technology is a breastfeeding simulation that gives mothers a realistic training session on the proper techniques of it.  It can teach them the proper way to hold the baby, proper orientation in which the baby should be held, and other important aspects that will reduce the discomfort to the nursing mother.  This simulation is hands on, providing a realistic baby and breast prosthetic for the mothers to practice using.  This system gives feedback, allowing the mother to adjust her technique until she gets it correct.  This technology could change how mothers approach breastfeeding. Advantages: -Hands-on training-Realistic simulation-Teaches correct technique Potential Applications: -Breastfeeding-Nursing mothers", 'Pulse Parameter Modulation for Neural Cell Stimulation': 'Electrical stimulation has been used for over two centuries to modulate the activity of various human physiological systems, especially the nervous system. An electrical pulse, typically in a square wave, is applied to the tissue to activate neural cells in the region. This type of stimulation is effective at achieving good neural stimulation but the system experiences a high type of resistance called impedance at the electrodes, increasing the power requirements and introducing more noise into the system.Purdue University researchers have developed a novel method of designing stimulus waveforms called Pulse Parameter Modulation (PPM). By pulsing the electric signal at the right rate the neurons respond the same way as they would to a continuous pulse with less impedance. This means that less power is needed to achieve the same effects, which will increase the lifespan of battery-powered implants and allows smaller stimulation electrodes with higher spacial locality. The pulsing can also be utilized to more selectively activate certain neuron populations (i.e. A, B, or C fibers) based on their activation levels and time constants.', 'Bioactive Glass-Polymer Bone Regeneration': "A broken bone unable to heal on its own is considered to have experienced a critical size defect; 5 to 10 percent of breaks fall into this category. The use of one's own bone tissue is currently the best available option, except it requires two surgeries, the material available is limited, and there is a risk of donor-site morbidity. The other option is to use bone tissue from a donor or a cadaver; these offer more material, but there is a risk of disease transmission, reduction of osteoinductive properties, and lack of osteogenic cellular components. In addition, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are sometimes used to improve osteoinductivity, but these proteins have a short half-life and must be added in supraphysiological doses. Without BMPs, there is a risk of ectopic bone formation. There is a need for a safer, more beneficial approach to bone regeneration.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology for healing bone defects using bioactive silicate glass (BSG) and a 3D osteomimetic composite porous scaffold containing microspheres comprised of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). Unlike other bioactive glasses which increase local pH, this demonstrates fast dissolution and ion release without impacting local pH; in addition, this BSG also contains higher calcium and phosphorous content. The beneficial mechanical properties of PLGA are combined with the bioactivity of the BSG, introducing the possibility of BSGs replacing autografts, allografts, and BMPs.Advantages: -Requires fewer surgeries-Displays minimal risk for disease transmission-Retains the osteoinductive properties-Retains the osteoinductive cellular components-Eliminates the need for BMPsPotential Applications: -Bone regeneration-Fixing critical size bone defects-Elimination of ectopic bone formation", 'DNA-Guided Gene Editing Tools': 'Gene editing has been a much sought after and very controversial technology.  Clustered Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is the current widely known gene editing technology.  The problem with this current technology is it restricted to targeting regions adjacent to a specific motif.  Another issue with CRISPR is that it can cause mutations throughout the genome.  This problem accounts for one of the reasons that gene editing is such a controversial topic.  There is a need for a new gene editing technology that could potentially solve these controversial issues.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology pertaining to gene editing.  This new method consists of Argonaute from Natronbacterium gregoryi or its mutants that target the enzyme to cleave specific regions of a chromosome or other extra chromosomal genetic material.  The DNA guides are designed as 24 nucleotides complementary to a gene of interest.  This technology reduces random cleavage and may be used for targeting gene editing.  This new technology could open the door for how gene editing is approached in the future.

An FDA approved anti-overdose drug, naloxone, counteracts the action of opioids. Although naloxone's availability has improved in recent years with legislation allowing for over-the-counter purchase of the drug, patients often are incapacitated and unable to administer the potential life-saving drug on themselves in a timely manner. There is a need for a single-use anti-overdose drug delivery method that allows drug users to administer an antidote to combat the effects of an overdose. Researchers from Purdue University have developed an implantable drug delivery device that injects a single dose of naloxone or another anti-opioid overdose drug. The device will inject under the skin of at-risk patients of opioid misuse and activate upon detection of an overdose event. When an overdose occurs, the body reacts with a sudden increase in temperatures and other abrupt changes to normal body function. Such sudden changes trigger the implanted device, allowing the anti-opioid overdose drug to diffuse the overdose before lethal effects occur. The device will facilitate delivery of the antidote for caretakers or emergency responders. In future iterations, incorporating feedback control allows for the automatic release of the antidote upon overdose detection. Advantages:-Facilitates delivery of antidote-Eliminates overdose-Wireless-ImplantablePotential Applications:-People at risk for drug overdose-Drug delivery-Implantable devices", 'Wearable Device for Monitoring Health/Activity Levels': "Existing wearable technology for monitoring activity also monitors heart rates using plethysmography; however, such technology cannot detect respiration or blood oxygenation levels from plethysmograph or from the wrist. Photoplethysmography uses an LED and photodiode to measure reflected light through human tissue. Existing heart monitors and pulse oximetry sensors worn on the finger use photoplethysmography; however, respiration and pulse oximetry have not been performed on the wrist nor is respiration detected from a finger. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a wearable device, i.e., watch, that detects respiration rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation using photoplethysmography. All physiologic measurements are obtained in a single, easy-to-access device that is worn on the wrist. In addition, it can monitor exercise and disease states, such as drug overdose, asthma, seizure, or other health issues, affecting respiration, heart rate, and/or oxygen saturation. In addition, this device calls for emergency response when a drug overdose is detected, breathing/heart rate stops, and/or oxygen saturation drops below an acceptable threshold. This technology makes advances beyond the popular wearable watch that monitors activity, by using technology that monitors an individual's physiologic state and disease state and calls for emergency response.Advantages: -Wearable on wrist-Physiologic measurements-Monitors and detects drug overdose and disease states affecting respiration, heart rate, and/or oxygen saturation -Calls for emergency response-Potential integration with existing technologyPotential Applications: -Monitor health/activity-Detects respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation -Detects drug overdose", 'Controlled Growth of Ultranarrow Inorganic Nanowires on 2D Materials': 'In the past, nanometer-think 2D layers have not been able to be stacked into 3D architectures.  They use monolayers to modify surfaces to control deposition of additional material layers, but this is inefficient.  This current process limits the scalability at the scale that they want to achieve, limiting their ability to fabricate inorganic architectures at the same scale.  There is a clear need for a new technology that will scale this fabrication at a level that they want to achieve.  Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that allows surfaces to be template with molecular features that can be converted into metallic features with similar size.  Also, the template is noncovalently bound to the substrate.  This may allow for the transferring of the template after features are developed.  This could mean that nm-thick 2D layers could be able to be stacked into 3D architectures.  This could allow for this technology to be more scalable than the current one, opening the door for how nanowires are developed and manufactured.  Advantages: -Converted to metallic features -Noncovalently-ScalablePotential Applications: -Headgroup synthesis-2D materials', 'Wearable Biometric to Predict and Prevent Preeclampsia and Hypertension': "Preeclampsia (or pregnancy related hypertension) is the most common complication to occur during pregnancy. It accounts for over $2.18 billion of U.S. health care expenditures in the first 12 months after birth. Of the 131 million pregnancies per year (4 million in the United States), approximately 10 percent are complicated by hypertension, leading to 3 million premature births. New insights suggest compromised blood flow through the kidneys plays a fundamental role in the development of preeclampsia. Researchers at Purdue University are refining a wearable biometric intended to screen for compromised kidney blood flow in 100 percent of pregnant women with the goal of predicting and preventing preeclampsia. Symptoms of preeclampsia can include high blood pressure, protein in the urine, swelling, and seizures. After the 20th week of pregnancy, the mass of the pregnant abdomen is well known to affect kidney blood flow, especially when a woman lies on her back. In women with a vulnerable anatomy, this compromised blood flow leads to high blood pressure. Previously published work has shown that an acute elevation in blood pressure associated with a pregnant woman shifting from her side to her back predicts approximately 90% of preeclampsia. The procedure is known as the supine pressure test (SPT). Furthermore, when detected early, rest in a therapeutic position, on one's side for example, has been shown to prevent preeclampsia. Purdue University researchers have developed a wearable biometric intended to both predict preeclampsia and better manage those women identified to be at risk. The technology couples a blood pressure measuring device with a body position sensor to ensure meticulous execution of the SPT. The device transmits via smartphone the changes in blood pressure and calculated predictive risk to a remote medical location. Sequential testing is intended to optimize test sensitivity. For those women identified to be at risk, the wearable device is also programmed to monitor a pregnant woman's resting position and communicate with her as needed to optimize position. The goal is to better predict and prevent preeclampsia and to allow expecting mothers to monitor their own health without frequent travel to a clinic.Advantages:-Predicts, manages, or prevents preeclampsia-Testing performed in the comfort of home-Results transmit to remote medical professionals-Affordable-PortablePotential Applications: -Early detection and prevention of preeclampsia-Reduce the number of premature births resulting from preeclampsia-Allow expecting mothers to monitor their own blood pressure without traveling to a clinic for frequent monitoring-Similar application available for those with obesity-related hypertension, since physiology has been shown to be similar.

Its deviation from normal can be a symptom of a variety of neuromuscular and vestibular disorders. Despite the importance of sway assessment, current technologies used to collect these movements are either too expensive and/or too difficult for the general public to operate outside of a lab environment. Wearable devices that measure human movement can enable daily sway assessment using inexpensive and easier to use sensors.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a mobile system based on a widely available platform (smartphones) and a custom-designed image processing software for human movement and sway assessment. This is a low cost, easy-to-use design that is portable and provides accurate assessments. Older adults, athletes, and others suffering from balance disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, can use this technology.

Water insoluble Kraft lignin is the most abundant side product produced by the pulp and paper industry at 50 to 100 million tons per year, most of which is burned as cheap fuel. Current applications of lignin are scarce, using only 2 to 5 percent of all lignin produced. Characteristics of lignin, including antioxidant, naturally degradable, biocompatible, and lacking in cytotoxicity, offer its potential use as a constituent in biomedical devices. The disparity in structure and surface properties make it finely tunable for controlled degradation, which is desirable in implanted devices. There remains a need to develop new lignin biopolymers and explore the new utilities of such lignin biopolymers.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a lignin biopolymer based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for harvesting mechanical energy in the environment. Most TENG research focuses on increasing power generation, but economical and eco-friendly obstacles continue to prevail. Lignin offers a valuable opportunity for low-cost TENG applications in self-powered biomedical devices, benefitting from its biodegradability and biocompatibility. In addition to self-powered biomedical devices, this technology presents an opportunity for the development of new technologies that utilize otherwise wasted materials for economically feasible and ecologically friendly production of functional devices in energy, electronics, and sensor applications.

Currently, a surgeon must rely on prior knowledge of the GPA location to avoid damaging it or surrounding nerves. Unfortunately, studies suggest that there can be a discrepancy of up to 4 mm and this uncertainty can cause a variety of surgical complications and injuries. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method to image arteries and lesions in the roof of the mouth. The technology described uses the contrast in optical properties between the arteries or lesions and the surrounding tissue to locate the GPA and lesions that are not visible to the naked eye. This allows for their exact location and depth to be computationally identified. In addition, researchers can print images of the artery on a surface mask that covers only the regions of tissue above the artery, providing surgeons a guide to areas of the mouth to avoid.

Advancements in neuroscience have increased the total market size considerably for various neural stimulation devices that target the spinal cord, cochlear, cerebral cortex, and other peripheral nerves. With advances in neurostimulation technologies, the demand for more precise targeting of neural substrate has fueled the development of higher density electrode arrays to improve the resolution of stimulation outcomes while minimizing unwanted side effects; however, chronic overstimulation is known to cause nerve damage. There is a need for developing higher efficiency, more durable electrodes.Researchers at Purdue University have developed new electrode designs to prolong the lifetime and function efficacy of implantable pulse generators. It was found that certain shapes can be used to more efficiently deliver electrical charge for stimulating the nervous system. Data shows that the electrode design reduces power consumption by up to 50 percent while increasing functionality effectiveness.

Gait rehabilitation training is an important part of retraining the legs for proper walking, but is challenging given the inability of the disabled legs to support the patient's body weight, particularly in the early stages. To compensate for this issue, body weight support (BWS) systems have been developed to reduce the patient's body weight, so the patient can walk with disabled legs during training without the burden of carrying the entire body weight. Normal walking undergoes 3D motion. Unfortunately, cable-suspended BWS systems balance the patient's body weight in the vertical direction only; there is no support in the other two dimensions. A Purdue University researcher has developed a new cable-driven body weight support system for use in gait rehabilitation training. The BWS system is expected to have the ability to compensate for any amount of a patient's body weight in all three dimensions during gait rehabilitation training. This BWS system is also expected to provide larger workspace, lower equipment cost, ease of assembly and disassembly, and superior reconfigurability.

However, the detection of s100B, a protein biomarker secreted in the presence of a traumatic brain injury (TBI), is a difficult task to manage. There are numerous methods for identifying biomarkers, but most dependable methods are cumbersome and involve multiple, time-consuming steps that severely limit on-site diagnosis. There is need for a method of detecting biomarkers easily and practically.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel functionalization technique that utilizes a piezoelectrically induced resonant microsystem, a promising medical diagnostic tool with high sensitivity. A plate-style resonator is used to sense biomarkers, including s100B, by detecting changes in mass due to biomarkers. The mechanical resonator demonstrates simple, yet powerful sensor functionality.

Currently, powering electronics relies on batteries; however, replacing batteries is difficult and expensive, especially for implantable devices. Moreover, materials used for batteries impose health and environmental hazards. Self-powered devices that can harvest energy from its environment, i.e., human body, holds promise for addressing this issue. Mechanical energy is ubiquitous and abundant for powering the sustainable operation of implanted medical devices. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as a promising technology for converting biomechanical energy into electricity. However, materials synthesis in TENG often involves expensive and elaborate processing and the materials are usually not biocompatible or degradable, presenting challenges for successful implementation of TENG in low-cost medical relevant applications.Researchers at Purdue University have developed novel lower-cost, biodegradable, and flexible triboelectric generators (TEGs) based on chitosan derived from crab shells or shrimp, which are currently disposed of in a landfill or the sea by the food processing industry, but could become a byproduct. Tunable electrical outputs were achieved by either mixing the chitosan with other natural materials, such as starch and lignin, or through laser processing. Laser treatment of biopolymer films with increased surface roughness offers a new way for surface engineering. The chitosan-based TEGs present efficient energy conversion performance and tunable degradation rate.

Unfortunately, its enhanced imaging speed introduces pixel-dependent readout noise, introducing biases and imaging artifact if left untreated. Currently, no algorithm exists for treating pixel-dependent noise/readout noise from microscopy images.Purdue University researchers have developed an algorithm that eliminates pixel-dependent noise/readout noise from microscopy images, restoring it to results seen with an ideal camera, making it possible to perform quantitative studies. Using an sCMOS camera, researchers achieved higher speed and quantum efficiency for scientific research.

This disruption in nerve fibers may cause flaccid paralysis, eventually leading to severe muscle atrophy. Following a major injury that results in denervation, the physical muscle tissue may heal, but without an adequate, functioning nervous system connection, no effective physical movement can be made. Research in this area has shown that if the damage is contained to certain nerves, the brain might rewire neurological circuitry and resume somewhat normal function. Unfortunately, in cases of muscle denervation, effective physical muscle movement cannot naturally be reversed.  A Purdue University researcher has developed a toolkit and a method for repairing and reconstructing a damaged or nonfunctional muscle using in vitro primed muscle progenitor cells to promote innervation of the damaged or nonfunctional muscle without any genetic manipulation. Muscle progenitor cells are harvested and grown to a critical mass in culture. The cells are then injected into the damaged or nonfunctional muscle and fuse with native muscle fiber. Following the injection, the muscle is innervated, atrophy has been shown to reverse, and the muscle fibers have an increased force of contraction.Advantages:-Does not use genetically modified cells-Allows the body to naturally regrow nerve connections-Clinically translatablePotential Applications-Innervation-Muscle repair-Tissue engineering', 'Smart Contact Lens for Therapeutic Applications': 'Soft contact lenses could offer an ideal platform for a broad range of devices ranging from medical devices offering ocular pain relief or drug delivery to augmented reality. Unfortunately, until recently, any combination of soft contact lenses with sensors, actuators, or any other semiconductor technology was not possible because current semiconductor processing requires a rigid, planar surface, which is not compatible with the soft, curved shape of a contact lens.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for attaching sensors and other small devices to the soft, curved, silicone-based structure of a soft contact lens. This cutting-edge technology utilizes semiconducting nanomaterials, as well as metallic and insulating traces, to serve as a thermal actuator, a wireless power supply, and an array of sensors. Purdue researchers have used this new therapeutic contact lens system to unclog meibomian glands, the primary cause of dry eye syndrome, via the controlled application of heat to the clogged ducts.

The advancement of prosthetic hands is of particular concern given the importance of social touch such as handshake, gentle strokes and pats, and even high fives. Disfigurement of the hands affects psychological well-being. Current prosthetic hands allow for artificial skin, but complex geometries lead to poor mechanical/electrical couplings, limiting humanlike social touch.A Purdue University researcher has developed an electronic glove (e-glove) in which various commercial gloves can serve as a platform for functional sensors.

This angle is primarily based on the ability to fire a rifle with the center of mass aligned to the forearm, with little to no wrist movement. The grip angle best accommodates shooting from the hip and a traditional bladed rifle stance. When using a bladed stance, the shooter's weak-side shoulder faces the target and the dominant elbow is positioned away from the body. Tactical shooting has led to the development of a squared, or athletic, stance. With the squared stance, the shooter's shoulders are squared-up with the target. The buttstock of the rifle is placed near the centerline of the body and high up on the chest with elbows kept down and tucked in. With current rifle grips, this stance results in ulnar deviation of the wrist causing wrist fatigue and injury.There are a variety of rifle grips on the commercial market that claim to be ergonomic. The majority of ergonomic grips address gripping itself. Instead of being entirely of plastic, the grips often have a rubber coating that conforms more to the shooter's hand. They often have grooves for finger placement as well. Other ergonomic grips attempt to address trigger span or reach, for example a grip that permits the shooter to effectively shim the grip backward to accommodate for a larger trigger reach. Another example is a grip designed to force the shooter to keep their elbows tucked-in to maintain a proper squared/athletic stance. This grip actually results in not only ulnar deviation of the wrist, but also supination (rotation) and extension of the wrist.NSWC Crane has designed, developed, and patented an adjustable ergonomic rifle grip that allows the grip angle to be modified to accommodate different shooting stances. By rotating the grip, wrist fatigue and injury can be minimized by allowing the shooter to hold the weapon at, or closer to, the natural wrist position. Additionally, the rotatable grip could be folded up to the body of the firearm to make it more compact for concealment or storage.

This model may be useful for studying cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer\'s disease, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. This research model will be created using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), injecting recombinant DNA constructs directly into a fertilized egg, and then injecting these eggs into pseudopregnant females.Advantages:-Specific removal of apolipoprotein E with site-specific DNA nucleases-Useful for wide range of clinically relevant disorders including cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer\'s diseasePotential Applications:-Researching cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer\'s disease, and other neurodevelopment disorders', 'Enhanced Imaging Using Vibrational Photoacoustic Tomography ': 'Atherosclerosis is a degenerative disease that causes plaque accumulation in the arterial wall that can eventually inhibit blood flow to various tissues and organs. Patients may experience pain when walking and decreased wound healing, which can lead to amputation. In more serious conditions, plaques can rupture, leading to a blood clot that can induce a stroke or heart attack. Aneurysms, on the other hand, occur when the artery wall weakens causing the vessel to bulge. Aneurysms may remain silent or rupture, causing internal bleeding and even death. Diagnosing, treating, and managing atherosclerotic-related diseases represent a significant cost to society. Established methods of diagnosing and monitoring atherosclerosis have limitations such has high cost, long imaging times, and may be minimally invasive. Atherosclerosis-related diseases also have high recurrence rate of between 10 and 20 percent during the first 12 months after treatment. Taken together, these unmet clinical problems suggest that better imaging techniques are needed to cost effectively monitor atherosclerosis progression before, during, and after therapeutic and surgical interventions.Vibrational Photoacoustic Tomography (VPAT) is an emerging imaging method that utilizes pulsed laser light to induce acoustic waves and obtain tissue-specific compositional information. When used in combination with ultrasound, VPAT has the potential to identify the location, size, and distribution of lipids in vivo. This is especially important in atherosclerosis diagnosis, as better techniques are needed to identify and characterize plaques in high-risk and asymptomatic patients. Researchers from Purdue University have developed a photoacoustic probe that allows for improved imaging of tissue. This technology has the ability to rapidly, non-invasively, and cost effectively locate and quantify plaque composition in vivo. VPAT has the potential to be used in the clinic to study atherosclerosis plaque development, evaluate the effectiveness of prospective therapeutics, and improve the diagnosis of atherosclerosis or related vascular diseases.Advantages:-Disease tracking-Does not require contrast agents-Rapid in vivo imaging capabilities-Potential for 3D imaging-Estimated cost is lower than conventional imaging techniquesPotential Applications:-Therapeutic research-Diagnosis of atherosclerosis or related vascular diseases-Determine treatment options', 'Clutch Crutch': "According to the Center for Disease Control, assistive devices, such as canes, wheelchairs, walkers, and crutches, are used by an estimated 6.5 million people on a day-to-day basis in the United States. Crutches are currently the most common assistive device used for rehabilitation of injuries to the lower leg. The problem with the most common crutch, the axillary crutch, is that it rests in the user's armpit, which can cause pain and injury. In addition, users do not have use of their arms or hands, making it difficult to perform routine activities such as opening doors.Given the problems with axillary crutches, there is continued R&D efforts for new crutch designs with hands-free options. Products, such as the iWalk*, Rollerfoot*, or Freedom Leg* target people with lower leg injuries. However, these designs each have their own shortfall such as increasing the amount of pressure applied to the knee, cannot be used on stairs, or does not allow for a smooth walking gait. Maintaining an active lifestyle with these designs often result in pain and discomfort over time. Researchers at Purdue University have developed the Clutch Crutch, a hands-free mobility device for individuals with a lower leg injury or a permanent disability. This mobility device attaches to the user's upper thigh and straps around their foot and ankle. The design distributes weight away from the lower leg. The design is modular, which makes it available to people of varying heights, weights, shapes, and lifestyles, allowing for optimal fit. Users assume a normal gait with full use of their hands and the ability to navigate stairs, uneven terrain, etc. In addition, wireless sensors can be integrated into the design to allow for communicating to the user's physician.To view a video related to this technology, click on this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w98En5CcwJ0Advantages:-Normal gait-Full use of hands-Can navigate stairs and uneven terrain-No force below knee-Modifiable-Absorbs shock-More affordable-Wireless communicationPotential Applications:-Rehabilitation-Medical/Health*Trademark", 'Skin-Mounted Sweat Sensor': 'The state of hydration in humans is a delicate physiological parameter with direct effects on body function at the cellular, organic, and systemic levels. Studies have shown that deviations as small as 2 percent lower than normal can reduce cognitive and physical performance by more than 30 percent. Unfortunately, monitoring and maintaining hydration can be difficult. Methods of analyzing these levels vary between serum ion concentration, urine color, and body mass. Body mass and urine analysis are the more conventional techniques, but lack accuracy due to measurement shortcomings. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a colorimetric dermal patch that measures human hydration by collecting and measuring sweat secretion over small areas of skin. Since most water loss in humans occurs via sweat, this method provides the most accurate analysis of hydration. The device consists of an inexpensive, laser-patterned filter paper sandwiched between two medical grade films, OpSite*. The filter paper contains a water-activated dye that provides an identifiable color change depending on moisture loss from small areas of skin. It is user friendly and easily identifies levels of moisture loss.

There is a need for an NEAPJ without such problems.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new device for generating cold plasma jets that uses pure DC voltage as opposed to AC voltage or pulsed DC power devices. Using a pure DC voltage reduces the problems caused by EMI, such as problems with medical monitors and medical devices. When EMI causes such devices to malfunction, it puts the patient at risk.Advantages:-Reduces electromagnetic interference and high ground leakage currents-Does not damage tissuePotential Applications:-Sterilization and disinfection of tissue wounds-Medical applications', 'Method and System that Simplifies Sample Prep and Pretreatment for Mass Spectrometer Analysis': 'Mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for the analysis of complex mixtures, which provides specific molecular information based on the molecular weights and chemical structures of the target compounds. Current mass spectrometry techniques require the sample to undergo a time-consuming pretreatment and extraction before it can be analyzed with a mass spectrometer. Once the sample has been treated and extracted it must be ionized, allowing for the manipulation and identification of the sample by the mass spectrometer. Each of these steps requires a significant amount of time and any mistakes could invalidate the entire test. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new approach for liquid-solid phase-liquid extractions and provides systems and methods that allow for the combination of sample preparation and pretreatment with the ionization process. Using a thin capillary tube and coating the inner surface with layers of adsorbents, it is possible to maintain full control of the extraction process. The thin capillary tube allows for the quantitative analysis of small sample amounts. In addition, the extraction capillary can serve as an ionization probe, allowing for the extraction, treatment, and analysis by mass spectrometry without separate sample preparation or pretreatment of a target analyte in a sample.

Today, prosthetics play an important role in allowing amputees to have an active lifestyle. However, these devices are still imperfect and do not mimic various aspects of the human body. Current prosthetics are extremely expensive, weigh between 1.5 and 2 pounds, and frequently break or tear. There is room for improvement in the development of prosthetic devices.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new prosthetic ankle that allows for a wider and more natural range of movement. Made out of aluminum, the prosthetic is composed of a toe joint, a pre-existing incline, and an ankle joint. This device allows for toe flexibility and natural lift, enabling more natural walking, running, and jumping for users.  This prosthetic is lightweight, is estimated to last for five years, and costs a fraction of the price compared to existing prosthetics.Advantages:-Wider range of movement-Improved natural movement for user-Lightweight-Durable-Low costPotential Applications:-Prosthetics for foot amputees including adolescents, the average person, and athletes', 'Multianalyte Sensing': 'The role of biological sensors is invaluable to the study of life sciences; sensors with higher accuracy, smaller size, or increased functionality enable deeper insights and improved tools for research or medical applications.

However, sometimes drugs are not effective by simply being ingested. Delivery of local or systemic drugs requires targeted doses to specific parts of the body. The accuracy of delivery is often hampered by inferior mechanical performance of the material used for delivery.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a functionalized hyaluronic acid (HA), a thermo-responsive elastic polymer system comprising functionalized HA, and the methods of fabrication and utilization for drug delivery. This polymer system is injectable and may be used for spatio-temporally controlled delivery of analgesics, anesthetics, antibodies, and other drugs as well as growth factors. Controlled drug delivery offers numerous advantages when compared to conventional dosage forms including improved efficacy, reduced toxicity, reduced need for specialized drug administration, and improved patient compliance/convenience.

Articular cartilage defects are resilient to natural repair and subject to high mechanical forces, which can lead to further tissue degeneration. Current microparticle systems require hostile exogenous crosslinking, have little control over the final microparticle density, and do not investigate the contribution of separate cartilage components to the chondrogenic induction and maintenance. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an alternative method of treatment that allows for custom molding of implants, increased porosity between particles for global cell delivery, and relatively small cartilage thicknesses for promoted cell infiltration. This technology uses native tissue and molecules, making it ideal in the application of articular cartilage. Unlike other methods that use synthetic polymer systems or native polymers that can lead to long-term degradation of cartilage, this technology provides dense packing of embedding matrix and cells.Advantages:-Eliminates potential for degradation of tissue after surgeryPotential Applications:-Biomaterials-Surgical components-Surgical technology', 'Diffusion Light Scattering for Nanoparticle Sizing and Biological Assays ': 'Bioconjugated nanoparticles are heavily used in diagnostics and therapeutics, but practical analytical tools for detection and characterization of colloidal solutions are greatly needed.  In addition, protein research is an expanding field, but with few tools that allow for high throughput analysis of things such as protein kinetics.  These analyses require detection technologies that can image down to the nanometer scale, but a method that operates at high throughput without the need for large samples does not exist.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology, Diffusion Light Scattering, which is an analyzer that can size nanoparticles and determine the uniformity of the nanoparticle system.  This technology allows researchers to size nanoparticles that they either synthesize or functionalized in lab with a mere microscope, eliminating the need for expensive laboratory equipment.  Sizing techniques often require large sample volumes, but in both biology and nanotechnology, such large sample sizes are difficult to make; this new analyzer uses smaller sample sizes less than 1 microliter.

A sensitive method to detect protein activity that overcomes these challenges has the potential to speed the pace and improve the quality of countless endeavors in biomedical research and diagnostics.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a platform that detects enzymatic activity in complex samples with high sensitivity that is cost-effective, high-throughput, and easily analyzed with current instrumentation. To accomplish this, a DNA sequence is used to encode a protein sample's activity in response to the presence of a drug or another change in conditions for each sample in a high-throughput assay.

A detection technology, named Bacteria Rapid Detection using Optical Scattering Technology (BARDOT), uses a single wavelength light source cast through a colony to create a scatter pattern that can be identified. However, only using one wavelength limits the technology's ability to differentiate as the desired level of taxonomy becomes more specific. Researchers at Purdue University have expanded the BARDOT technology into a multiple wavelength interrogation instrument that will let the user take advantage of the benefits of scatter patterns from different laser wavelengths. It allows for a measurement time for three different wavelengths under four seconds by using a simple, stackable, cage-type pellicle beam splitter structure. This additional information increases the technology's ability to detect and identify bacteria with greater precision than before. This increased speed and accuracy of detection and identification would save time and money for users in fields ranging from food safety to biosecurity.

It is a very important tool in sensing chiral structures that don't superimpose onto their mirror image and has application areas that include biological sensing, stereochemistry, crystallography, and DNA structural analysis. CD spectrometers measure the spectrum of differential absorption between left and right circularly polarized light (LCP and RCP). Conventional spectrometers utilize a process that includes time-consuming, complicated software and requires increasing the size of the device. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a real-time CD spectrometer that separates LCP and RCP spectra in space using either a dielectric or metallic metasurface. This technology, which is submillimeter in size, includes a spectrometer that conducts real-time, power-efficient measurement without the need for a laser source or broadband lamp. This technology can generate strong phase accumulation, which can be used to reflect or transmit LCP and RCP at a wavelength dependent angle.

Currently, there are many methods of immunodetection, including traditional optical labeling, such as fluorescence and phosphorescence, and more recent developments using antibody-immobilized bacteria or bacteria bound to microfluidic chips that have been developed to increase optical signals, but many of these techniques are designed to identify a particular type of bacteria and do not allow for multiplexing or simultaneous detection of multiple bacterial species. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for simultaneous identification of multiple pathogenic organisms using heavy metal antibody tagging and plasma-based detection (MAPD). MAPD uses a traditional immuno-recognition approach, but is able to simultaneously detect and identify the presence of multiple antigens without requiring multiple, time-consuming experiments performed in parallel. This method offers fast and sensitive pathogen detection with minimal sample processing and preparation. The use of heavy metal tags generates a very low signal background, which allows MAPD to be used on a large subset of molecular targets that can be combined in a simple, low cost manner.

When muscles are not used, the muscles atrophy and a loss of muscle strength occurs. Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, are a common occurrence for those that are bedridden or sedentary. As our population continues to age, more people will experience such effects. One challenge of extended space travel is the long-term effects of microgravity on the human body. Approximately 1.5 percent of bone tissue is lost per month of space travel, leading to an increased risk of bone fractures and osteoporosis when astronauts return to earth. Skeletal muscle is no longer required to maintain posture. Given the aforementioned, the unique subset of muscles used in microgravity leads to rapid overall muscle atrophy. In addition, elevated blood calcium levels from bone loss result in dangerous calcification of soft tissues and potential kidney stone formation. It is unknown whether bones ever truly recover completely. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a device that can provide daily mechanical stimulation to an appendage such as an arm, to prevent the loss of bone density and muscle atrophy in a bedridden environment or in space travel. This device is a comfortable, lightweight sleeve that can be worn every day for 30 minutes to promote bone and muscle health for those that are sedentary, bedridden, or traveling in space. The mechanical stimulation encourages natural blood flow throughout the arm, which is known to stimulate and maintain bone density and muscle tone. This device could be used to prevent bedsores in bedridden patients, fracture healing, osteoporosis prevention, and other ailments related to blood circulation. In addition, it could be used after extended space travel.Advantages: -Prevents loss of bone density and muscle atrophy in bedridden or microgravity situations -Prevents bedsores -Osteoporosis prevention -Increases blood circulationPotential Applications: -Aeronautics Engineering/Manufacturing -Medical/Healthcare', 'Gas Aided Imaging Using Amphiphilic Block Copolymers ': "Poly (propylene carbonate) (PPC) is a plastic material that can be mass produced from naturally abundant carbon dioxide. This polymer is also known to decompose back to CO2 when heated to a specific temperature. It is a promising material for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications due to this biodegradable and biocompatible nature, and the released gas can be used for imaging, such as ultrasound, when the material is bound to a site within a patient's body. However, the decomposition temperature is above 200 degrees C and bulk PPC is not water soluble. Therefore, use of PPC for such processes has been limited. Conventional gas-containing ultrasound contrast agents consist of a nano- or micron-sized gas bubbles surrounded by a shell layer made of a polymer or lipid. These previous systems have suffered from several problems and shortcomings, including limited stability, low efficiency of delivery, and difficulty of manufacture.Researchers at Purdue University have investigated the thermal degradation of a PPC-based amphiphilic block copolymer, and found that these triblock copolymers form stable small-sized (less than 200 nm) micelles in water. They have also demonstrated that the CO2-generation temperature of PPC can be reduced down to the 40-80 degree C range in aqueous environment by using a catalyst for activating the random scission reaction of PPC. Therefore, with using micelles and the catalyst, the CO2 bubbles can be generated within a target tissue in vivo by delivering the polymer as micelles, and the gas is produced by hydrolysis of the polymer precursor in mild heating conditions.Advantages: -Bubbles generated in target tissue-Enhanced imagingPotential Applications:-Ultrasound devices industry-Biomedical technology", 'Triggerable Oxygen Nanobubbles for Drug Delivery, Diagnosis, and Enhanced Survival ': 'Ultrasound has a broad clinical utility in prostate cancer diagnosis because of its diagnostic capabilities, ease of use, portability, and ability to reveal fluid flow and structure of anatomy in vivo.

By 1958, the machines had evolved to a point where amino acids and peptides structures could be roughly analyzed. As scientists began to understand the varied applications that could be applied, mass spectrometers began appearing in operating rooms, outer space, and many scientific laboratories studying pharmacology, proteomics, metabolomics, glycans, atoms, and gas samples. During its evolution, the mass spectrometer grew bigger and more complex. Starting in the late 1990s and early 2000s, scientists began to construct smaller mass spectrometers for easy sample collection in hospitals and developing countries. Due to the nature of loading a sample in the machine and converting it into ions, the current equipment requires a vacuum, pump, and large amount of energy to maintain pressure and move the ions through the chambers into the analyzer. Changes to components on the mass spectrometer will create a more advantageous power-to-pump ratio, but will reduce the transfer efficiency of the ions through the chambers. Smaller, mobile mass spectrometers require a novel ion loading mechanism for improved integration into varying environments.Purdue University researchers have developed a device that can produce and focus a stream of ions into a mass spectrometer at atmospheric pressure or higher. This new component works with existing mass spectrometers, reduces the amount of power required to load and analyze a sample, and will not hinder the mobility of a small mass spectrometer.Advantages:-Produce and focus a steam of ions at atmosphere pressure or higher-Works with existing mass spectrometers-Uses less power-Does not hinder mobility of small mass spectrometersPotential Applications:-Laboratories-Mass Spectrometer Manufacturers', 'Diaper-Embedded Transponder for Monitoring Urinary Tract Infection': "Urinary tract infections account for more than 8.1 million visits to physicians' offices per year.

To obtain such adhesion, several synthetic polymers are used in adhesives such as Gorilla Glue, Super Glue, and Elmer's glue. Unfortunately, these synthetics often require massive amounts of oil during manufacturing and are not biodegradable, which limits their use in many applications such as biomedical products. Purdue University researchers have developed super strong adhesives by incorporating lactic acid with mussel adhesive chemistry. Lactic acid, which can be derived from corn, enables the incorporation of a sustainable monomer into the backbone and is FDA approved for internal use in humans, opening the door into many biomedical uses. The adhesives use a polyester backbone, which degrades into nontoxic components, a beneficial characteristic in surgical adhesives.

For conditions, such as hydrocephalus, a method to resolve these issues is in situ recanalization after revision surgery and in-patient neurosurgery, while for central venous access, there needs to be full replacement of these devices. Often times, patients need to be concomitantly treated with blood thinners, antibiotics, and other drugs that have other side effects. Therefore, both processes can be costly, risky, and painful for patients. To resolve such issues, researchers at Purdue University have looked at the well-known technique of magnetic nanoparticle induced hyperthermia for treatment of cancer cells and used this method to coat or infuse magnetic nanoparticles on implantable catheters. This would induce localized heat (hyperthermia) using external magnetic fields and help to remove or prevent cellular occlusion at the site of these catheters that are used for various medical procedures. This technology would also reduce the need for revision surgery or replacement of devices and can be used in situ and activated non-invasively, making it much safer and cost-effective.

Common testing materials include animal skin, cling wrap, and natural rubber. These substitutes are unhygienic, too weak to simulate human skin, or the properties vary within one sample.Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane), has developed, designed, and patented a skin and tissue simulant for munitions testing that replicates the significant resistance that human skin provides to prevent munition projectiles from penetrating into human tissue. This technology includes a gelatin composite block and an ether based cast polyurethane sheet. The gelatin composite block acts as the tissue simulant and the sheet acts as the skin simulant to determine the potential a given munition projectile has for penetrating skin. This new and improved skin and tissue simulant is an advancement over old testing materials because it adds the resistance that is naturally present in a human body.Advantages:-Superior simulant with valid penetration evaluation -More hygienic than typical simulants-Consistent or with less variations in raw materialsPotential Applications:-Medical testing-Veterinary-Hunting-Weapons testing', 'Assistive Interface for the Visually Impaired': 'At present, if we look at blind or visually impaired (BVI) people, there is no suitable substitute technology to enable this population to interpret visual scientific data from lab experimentation in real time, such as performing light microscopy, spectrometry, chemical reactions, and using other scientific instruments. Current technologies for this purpose include tactile paper, which is limited because it is not real time, has to be made in advance, requires more staff, and does not allow independent work for blind students. To address this challenge, Purdue University researchers developed a real-time multimodal image perception system to transform scientific data to something more useful. Image features such as size, color, shape, intensity, location, texture, and opacity are individually mapped through three different sensory channels of hearing, haptics, and vibrotactility. Experimental results have confirmed that this real-time approach provides greater accuracy in recognizing and analyzing objects within images compared to tactile papers. Participants have also shown better analytic performance with this technology compared to other one-sensory standard interfaces. Although this technology may take more time when exploring an image, it also allows higher accuracy during the actual analysis of that information. Thus, this technology has potential use during lab experimentation for BVI people, which would greatly enhance information interpretation. It would allow advancement in careers in medicine, biology, chemistry, and others alike that has so far been restricted for this population.

These tags can visualize molecules, such as EdU and cytochrome c, via a Raman microscope. The alkyne tags also allow direct visualization of DNA synthesis and cytochrome c release from mitochondria in living cells. This enhanced imaging technique is due to the large scattering cross sections of the alkyne tags that are biologically inert. With this new technology, there is potential for use in the study of NP-C, which is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that use lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and can be used for atherosclerosis and various cancer diagnoses. Therefore, genomic screening of cholesterol related genes could lead to an improvement in therapy and management of these conditions. Advantages: -Images small cholesterol based molecules -Biologically inert and better scattering section -Can be applied to screen multiple conditionsPotential Applications:-Therapy-Health condition management', 'Perforated MOS Structure for Single Biomolecule Detection': 'Characterizing and sequencing single biomolecules, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, carbohydrates, etc., offers significant impact to science, medicine, and biotechnology. Single biomolecule detection has many benefits and could allow for early disease detection and screening, have pharmacological relevance, and help in understanding genetic information encoded in DNA. There are many proposed methods of studying single biomolecules, but they have several limitations. Many techniques require the isolation of the molecule prior to study, and most techniques are also limited by sample preparation, sensitivity, and specificity to specific categories of biomolecules. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for single biomolecule detection that allows for characterization and sequencing of biomolecules without the limitations of current nanochannel technologies. This method uses a metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensor with embedded, fluidic nanochannels. As a biomolecule moves through the nanochannel, a high frequency current is generated that contains information about the biomolecule, such as the type of nucleotides in the case of DNA/RNA, which can be used to sequence the molecule. This method does not have the problems associated with other nanopore techniques because it does not require the difficult drilling of extremely small nanopores, can detect four nucleotides at a time, and is not significantly affected by the rotation or position of the biomolecule in the nanochannel. Advantages: -Detection of single molecule or low concentration biomolecules, bio-polymers, RNAs, DNAs, carbohydrates, proteins, viruses, and virions -Lowers the cost of sequencing single molecule DNAs, RNAs, and carbohydrates -Addresses shortcomings of current nanochannel technologyPotential Applications:-Development of tools for early detection of a number of diseases and environmental hazards-Biomedical applications in diagnosis and therapy-Early detection of viruses-Study of carbohydrates-Genetics', 'Electromagnetic Drug Delivery Using Nanowires': 'Targeted drug delivery methods aim to confine the concentration of medication in some body parts relative to others. The goal of such treatments is to target only the diseased tissue maximizing the effectiveness of each dose and reducing negative side effects in other tissues. Cancer treatment is one of the most highly researched areas within targeted drug delivery due to the potential of therapies that target tumors, avoiding the nonspecific side effects of chemotherapy. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an electromagnetic drug delivery system constructed of polypyrrole (PPy) nanowire matting. This material is designed to act as a reservoir for drugs, and is responsive to an externally applied electromagnetic field (EMF) that induces the release of the captured drug into the local environment. Delivery can be turned on or off by using the noninvasive EMF source located remotely from the PPy drug reservoir. The therapeutic agent can be delivered from the inserted or surgically placed PPy mat for many weeks, and the specific region that is targeted can receive very high drug concentrations while systemic regions remain unaffected. Advantages: -Localized drug targeting -Dosage control -Reduction in negative, systemic side effects Potential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical Industry', 'SafePace:  Pacemaker Lead Placement System': 'Pacemakers are biomedical devices implanted into patients with hearts that have difficulty pumping blood throughout the body. Electrical stimulation from leads in the pacemaker helps the cardiac tissue contract in an effective rhythm. The stability of the pacemaker leads must be assessed to guarantee successful pacemaker implantation, but current methods of testing can leave a wide range of inconclusive results.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new device that will allow surgeons to accurately determine if pacemaker leads have been implanted stably. The device will be fitted mechanically to the pacemaker lead and the surgeon will easily be able to determine if the device disengages from the lead or not. If the device disengages, the implantation has been successful. Otherwise, if the device does not disengage, the implantation is not stable and the pacemaker implantation must be repeated. This device provides a simple method for testing pacemaker lead stability with a clear result.To view a video related to this technology, click on this link:  http://youtu.be/YMSs4vFzf48Advantages:-Simple to use-Clear, accurate answer about pacemaker lead stabilityPotential Applications:-Medical/Health', 'Metabolite-Imaging Mass Spectrometry to Guide Brain Surgery': 'Currently, one of the main treatments for brain tumors is surgery. Performing a tumor resection within the brain is difficult because it is not easy to distinguish tumor boundaries from healthy brain tissue. Existing imaging techniques do not provide the necessary molecular information to distinguish tumor boundaries. An unclear boundary between a tumor and healthy tissue can lead to inadequate resection if enough of the tumor remains and neurological damage if healthy tissue is removed.Purdue University researchers have developed a method for surgeons to define tumor margins quickly during surgery using miniature mass spectrometers or separate ionization techniques. This method overcomes the need for prepping, staining, and evaluation by a pathologist. It is also possible to adapt this method for other types of cancer surgery.Advantages:-Overcomes need for prepping, staining, and evaluation by a pathologist-Can be used to determine tumor boundariesPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Cancer surgery', 'Oxygen Generator to Aid Cancer Treatment': "Radiation, surgery, and chemotherapy are the three major treatments for cancer. Radiation destroys cancer cells by using high-energy photons to damage the cell's DNA. The effectiveness of radiation is dependent upon the oxygen concentration in tumors; however, the abnormal structures of tumor vasculature are leaky, lending the tumor environment hypoxic. Hypoxia can impede the success of radiation therapy because oxygen is necessary for successful cancer treatment. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an ultrasonically powered, implantable micro-oxygen generator that can increase oxygen levels in a tumor target during radiation treatment. The generator has overall dimensions of 1.2mm x 1.3mm x 8mm, so it is small enough to be implanted using a hypodermic needle. This technology performs electrolysis to generate oxygen, which may be able to restore intratumoral oxygen concentrations to a normal or hyperoxygenated level, increasing the effectiveness of cancer treatment outcomes. Advantages: -Increases effectiveness of cancer radiation treatments -Small size allows easy implantation -Ultrasonically powered using external sourcePotential Applications:-Cancer Treatment-Pharmaceuticals-Medical Devices-Medical/Health", 'Nanostructured Bioactive Stent to Induce Closure of Cerebral Aneurysms': 'According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, brain aneurysms can occur to anyone at any age. Aneurysms occur when a weak section of a blood vessel balloons out and fills with blood. These can burst and cause severe internal bleeding, nerve damage, or stroke. There are currently two methods of treating an aneurysm that has burst: clipping and coiling. Clipping, like the name suggests, requires a dangerous surgery to open the brain and expose the aneurysm which is then clipped shut with a small metal clip. Coiling involves threading a catheter through an artery to the site of the aneurysm, and once there, tiny platinum coils are released to block the leak and cause the blood to clot. The danger with coiling is the chance of forming unwanted blood clots in the cerebral artery.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a bioactive stent that allows surgeons to quickly stop the bleeding without brain surgery or risk of unwanted clots. The stent is designed to attract biological cells to its surface where a special coating promotes tissue growth and healing. The stent is inserted at the aneurysm similarly to the coiling method where it attaches to the aneurysms neck and begins the healing process. By securely attaching to the artery, the risk of blood clots is minimized. This method allows surgeons to quickly treat and heal cerebral aneurysms, thereby saving thousands of lives each year.Advantages:-Attracts cells to quickly close aneurysmPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Medical devices', 'Sepsis Treatment Derived from Chitosan': "Septicemia refers to the presence of pathogens in the bloodstream that leads to sepsis, a potentially life-threatening medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation and the presence of infection. When microbes infect the blood, skin, lungs or other tissues, the body's immune system generates an inflammatory response in an attempt to fight the infection. The body's immune response to the infection causes the characteristic symptoms of sepsis and can lead to organ failure. The current treatment for sepsis requires antibiotics, fluid drainage, blood transfusions, and dialysis. Since individual cases are caused by different microbes, the correct antibiotic must be chosen to treat the infection. This causes a delay in treatment, which leads to an increase in the mortality rate. Purdue University researchers have developed a novel treatment for septicemia involving molecules derived from chitosan. Chitosan is a linear carbohydrate with many commercial and biomedical uses. This treatment inactivates endotoxins, which are toxins associated with certain types of bacteria and stimulates cytokine release (part of the body's inflammatory response that causes swelling and high fever). This new chitosan shows many advantages over current IV treatments for septicemia. This technology can be used to filter endotoxins out of plasmid DNA samples and filter bacteria from water, making contaminated water samples safe to drink. Advantages: -Stronger affinity for inactivating endotoxins -Excellent biocompatibility upon injection -Lower potential to cause hemolysis, complement activation, and inflammatory responses -Can filter endotoxins out of plasmid DNA samples and remove bacteria from waterPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Sepsis treatment-Contaminant removal from drinking waterRelated Publications:Yoon Yeo, et al.

While there are imaging techniques that can be used for determining nanoscale structural information, these techniques are unsuitable for applications with living biological materials. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for the investigation of structural and chemical information at the single cell level. This method uses a radiofrequency probe coupled with an atomic force microscopy cantilever for precise localization to areas of interest and magnetic resonance for determining nanoscale structural information. This technology couples the precision of atomic force microscopy with magnetic resonance imaging to allow for single cell imaging of living biological materials. This technology will allow researchers to gather nanoscale information on the surface and subsurface levels of individual cells. Advantages: -Offers precise localization to features/materials of interest -Provides nanoscale structural information in addition to local spectroscopic information -Suitable for investigation at the single cell levelPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Imaging', 'Implantable Pressure Sensor with Integrated Guyton Chamber': 'Monitoring in vivo pressure is a critical element in many medical applications including cancer and glaucoma treatment. However, the interaction of biological materials with pressure sensors leads to sensor drift, which causes the pressure sensors to become highly inaccurate and lose sensitivity after a short time. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an implantable pressure sensor that eliminates the interaction of cells and other biological materials with the sensor. This sensor uses an integrated Guyton chamber that separates the pressure sensor from the surrounding cells and biomolecules. Thus, in vivo pressure can be monitored for a much longer time than current methods while maintaining high accuracy. This method can be used for several types of sensors including capacitive and piezoresistive sensors. Advantages: -Protects pressure sensor from long-term drift -Can be used for several types of sensorsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare', 'Wireless Tracking for Radiation Cancer Therapy': 'A serious side effect of radiation therapy for cancer treatment is that it kills healthy cells as well as cancerous cells. To limit the damage to healthy tissue, radiation is directed only to the area around the tumor, which is not easy because of organ movement within the body. Organ movement must be tracked to minimize collateral damage. Wired and wireless tracking systems currently exist, but both have drawbacks. Wired systems require wires to extend through the skin, which increases the risk of infection and can be mentally distressing to a patient. Existing wireless systems use passive transponders and can only track one at a time. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel wireless magnetic tracking system that may include a plurality of transmitting coils each configured to generate a magnetic field when energized by active transponders, which may include at least two magneto-resistive sensors. Multiple transponders can be tracked quickly and accurately. The transponders can also function as dosimeters to measure the radiation intensities at various sites.Advantages:-Transponders have integrated sensors-Multiple transponders can be usedPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Cancer treatment-Radiation therapy', 'Implantable Wireless Glucose Sensor': "Type 1 diabetes afflicts approximately one million people living in the United States and 10 to 20 million people worldwide. Caused by the body's inability to produce its own insulin to regulate blood glucose levels, type 1 diabetes can cause a wide variety of complications and requires careful monitoring of glucose levels and insulin injections. The most common way to monitor blood glucose levels is with a finger stick, which measures glucose at a point in time, potentially missing important fluctuations, such as sudden hypoglycemic episodes. The most effective way to measure glucose levels is to monitor it continuously in a way that it could be recorded and tracked. To accomplish this, various monitor designs have been proposed, including several designs for implantable sensors, but most require an internal power supply or make use of potentially dangerous enzymes. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new design for an implantable glucose monitor that requires no internal power and has a fast reaction time to changes in glucose levels. This device uses a glucose sensitive ferrogel, which grows and shrinks based on the level of glucose present. This device is expected to have an area no larger than one cubic centimeter and once implanted into the body's soft-tissue, the ferrogel's change in size can be detected wirelessly, providing a continuous measurement of glucose levels.Advantages:-Device requires no internal power supply-Fast reaction time to changes in glucose levels-Provides continuous measurement of glucose levelsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceutical industry", 'Method of Osteochondral Tissue Engineering': 'Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease affecting joints. It is characterized by the wearing of articular cartilage, hyaline cartilage found at the ends of bones to cushion the joint. Articular cartilage facilitates the smooth, painless movement of joints. The goal of treating articular cartilage damage is to provide relief from joint pain, slow the progression of damage, and delay joint replacement surgery; however, treatment is difficult due to the inherent properties of cartilage tissue. Recently, tissue engineering based methods have shown promise; however, they result in tissues that are structurally inferior to natural cartilage. Purdue University researchers have developed a novel technique to produce osteochondral tissue. This unique fabrication method, Magnetic Prototyping in 3D (MAP3D), can control zonal collagen orientation in a noninvasive manner. MAP3D layered osteochondral constructs have precise collagen alignment that mimics the native tissue, incorporating many key structural elements to modulate depth-dependent biomechanical properties and localizing protein expression. MAP3D allows for tailored macroscale function that can promote joint preservation and prolong the time patients can function before needing total joint replacement surgery. Advantages: -Compressive stiffness of the collagen scaffold is increased by 50 percent -Controls collagen alignment noninvasively -Collagen alignment mimics natural tissuePotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Biotechnology', 'Morphologically Friendly Tissue Imaging': 'Imaging mass spectrometry is currently in the translational phase as a tool in medical histopathology and offers a capability of mapping drugs, metabolites, lipids, peptides, and proteins without the need for labeling. Currently, a primary limitation preventing good correlational analysis is the use of chemicals that destroy native tissue structures.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel, morphologically friendly method for DESI-MS tissue imaging. The use of processing chemicals that preserve native tissue structures, instead of destroying them, expands the applications of DESI-MS to tissue imaging. DESI-MS has been used in real time to help surgeons decide how much tissue to take during cancer removal procedures. This new morphologically friendly procedure allows a facile means to distinguish between cancerous and healthy tissues. Advantages:-Native tissue structure preserved\t -Enhanced imaging of complex cancerous tissuesPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Medical imaging', 'Sensitive Folate Receptor Detection by Immunomagnetic Diffractometry': 'Despite the diversity of available malignant disease detection platforms, important challenges still remain in minimizing sensor size, reducing detection time, eliminating target-labeling requirements, minimizing signal amplification steps, and developing simple and inexpensive fabrication protocols.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an integrated approach for the rapid detection of the folate receptor (FR) using in situ assembled optical diffraction gratings in combination with immunomagnetic capture. With this approach, a detection sensitivity of 700 fM (20 pg/ml) was achieved without any fluorescent or radiolabels or any secondary signal amplification. This approach can be applied to other targets and has the potential to be a broadly applicable, highly sensitive analysis technique. Advantages:-Allows early detection of cancer-Sensitive to femtomolar concentrations-Simpler assay with lower detection limit compared to current standardPotential Applications:-Cancer Detection-Medical/Healthcare', 'DNA Modified Nanocomposite Microbiosensors': 'Electrochemical biosensors have offered new insights into cellular metabolism. The technology allows scientists to measure the metabolic activity (oxygen, glucose, lactate, etc.) of a single cell or a group of cells. Conventional biosensor materials suffer from low sensitivity and low spatial resolution, but single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) combined with black nanoparticles have been shown to significantly enhance performance. However, it was noted that the carbon nanotubes suffer from aqueous insolubility, limiting the ability to interact with the metabolite of interest.   Purdue University researchers have developed a technology that uses nanocomposites in electrochemical biosensors. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was used to modify SWCNTs to increase solubility in water, making it more useful in physiological applications. The ssDNA-SWCNT nanocomposite exhibits high sensitivity, wide linear range of detection, and low limit detection. This work is significant to biosensor development because this is the first demonstration of ssDNA-SWCNT nanocomposite as a platform for constructing both single-enzyme and multi-enzyme biosensors for physiological applications.Advantages:-Increased sensitivity and spatial resolution-Lowered limit of detectionPotential Applications:-Genetics-Biotechnology', 'Imaging for the Prediction and/or Detection of Skin Cancer': 'Recent animal studies have demonstrated that primary tumor formation sites can be discerned before a tumor develops by taking measurements of the hemoglobin and extracellular matrix structures in the skin.Purdue University researchers have developed a technique (and possible device) to predict where a tumor will form on the skin after exposure to a carcinogen. The current area surveyed can be a few hundred millimeters squared and penetrates two millimeters in depth. In mouse studies, the technique predicted the result of foci with a high statistical accuracy. Applications of this technology include tissue engineering scaffold development, dermatology rejuvenation and diagnosis, diagnostic screening of patients who have undergone laser treatments, toxicology studies testing the response to a drug, and devices for pathologist to use in the operating room to get a better understanding of the margins on a tumor.Advantages:-Predicts where a tumor will form on the skin-Can help surgeons better understand the margins of a tumor-High statistical accuracy in mouse studiesPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Medical imaging-Cancer detection', 'Detection of Oxidized Proteins for Medical Diagnostics': "Oxidative damage to DNA, RNA, and proteins can seriously threaten the survival of a biological system. High concentrations of radical oxygen species have been implicated in many diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and a variety of inflammatory diseases. Oxidative stress appears to be caused in part by an organism using iron to carry out oxidative processes. Free radicals, ranging from hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, and peroxynitrite to superoxide, occur widely in cells as part of the assimilation and metabolism of nutrients. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a diagnostic method for determining the absence or presence of a disease. This method includes assaying the amount and/or type of oxidized peptides in a sample from a subject and comparing them to the amount and types of reference oxidized peptides. For example, using this technique could identify and quantify changes in oxidized peptides or oxidized proteins associated with diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus or breast cancer. This diagnostic method can also be used to monitor a patient's response to a therapeutic agent, e.g., an antioxidant, and monitor disease recurrence. Using the vital information collected with this method, a tailored treatment plan can be created to better aid a patient's recovery. Advantages: -Proteomic approach to disease monitoring and diagnosis -Protein biomarkers detected at low concentrations -Earlier detection of a large number of diseases -Non-invasive testPotential Applications:-Bioinformatics-Medical/Healthcare", 'Selective Capture and Identification of Bacteria': 'Rapid identification of infectious pathogens is crucial in limiting the spread of contagious diseases. Unfortunately, current tests for most pathogens require hours or days of processing time. Antibody-based detection strategies have shown faster testing times, but become obsolete when the pathogen mutates its antibody binding sites. With the emergence of increasingly virulent strains of common pathogens, there is a need for new strategies with rapid turnaround times and the ability to detect mutated strains.Purdue University researchers have developed a novel technique for selective capture and identification of pathogenic bacteria using immutable ligands. These are pathogen-specific ligands that the disease-causing organism must bind to in order to remain virulent. Examples of immutable ligands include host cell surface molecules that the pathogen must bind to in order to infect its host and nutrient molecules that the microbe must internalize to survive. This method first immobilizes the immutable ligand onto a chip. When the chip is exposed to its matching pathogen, binding occurs. The chip can then be quantitatively evaluated using image processing algorithms, which are not only fast and accurate, but can also be used in a multiplex approach where a sample can be screened for a wide variety of pathogens simultaneously.Advantages:-Rapid multiplex test results-Detection invulnerable to pathogen mutationsPotential Applications:-Biotechnology-Toxin Detection-Medical/Healthcare', 'Touch Actuated Micropump for Transdermal Drug Delivery': "Transdermal delivery of medications and other compounds has been aggressively pursued for many decades. Although patches have been used to deliver small hydrophobic molecules such as nicotine and nitroglycerin, an external pressure source in conjunction with a direct subcutaneous access port are required to deliver the majority of therapeutically important drugs through the skin. Microfluidics has played an important role in this area by providing microneedle arrays and miniature pumps. Although microneedle arrays made of silicon, polymers, and metals have reached a high degree of maturity in the past decade, their application has been limited due to the lack of a suitable micropump with adequate flow rate and back pressure.Purdue University researchers have developed a new type of pump for drug-delivery patches that would use arrays of microneedles to deliver a wider range of medications possible than with conventional patches. The pump contains a liquid that boils at body temperature so that the heat from a finger's touch causes it to rapidly turn into a vapor, exerting enough pressure to dispense the drug through the microneedles. This technology's low-cost and battery-less operation make it the ideal single-use disposable transdermal drug dispenser. Advantages:-Battery-less operation-Low-cost and disposablePotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Medical devices-Pharmaceuticals-Drug development", 'Flexible Neural Probe for Magnetic Insertion': 'The brain is soft and compliant; a successful probe needs to match the mechanical properties of the brain. Foreign body response is also reduced in objects with small diameters. Small, thin probes lack the mechanical strength needed for implantation. In order to puncture the tissue, they would need to be hard, which is not compatible with the mechanical properties of the brain. In addition, to minimize tissue response, a probe would need to be thin. With conventional materials, this would make the probe brittle and prone to fracture. Probes for neural applications are often limited by their properties; most electrodes are made of hard, stiff materials and are restricted by dimensions for insertion. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology to allow for the use of tissue-compliant materials as neural probes. The technology uses insulated wires affixed to a magnetically responsive tip in order to insert a probe into the brain. This tether allows magnetically induced insertion of small thin probes that minimize tissue damage responses and match the mechanical properties of the brain. Advantages: -Allows for use of soft, compliant materials that more closely match brain tissue -Not limited in dimension -Minimizes tissue damage in deep brain stimulator applicationsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Medical devices', 'Biocompatible Encapsulation of Living Cells and Tissues\r\n': "Type 1 diabetes affects approximately two million people in the United States alone. The disease is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system destroys the pancreatic islet beta cells, sufficiently stopping the production of insulin. Current therapies can only treat the disease instead of cure it. Insulin therapy requires lifelong injections of insulin every day and does not prevent against chronic complications. A pancreas transplant requires life-long immunosuppression therapy, and current islet transplantations offer an initial success, but drops off with time. Other challenges associated with islet transplantation include cadaveric donor islet availability and a loss of islets in the immediate post-transplant period because of innate immune responses.Researchers at Purdue University have developed sol-gel encapsulation techniques to optimize the sustainability of islet transplantation treatment. Using this technique, the researchers are able to encapsulate cells enabling immunoisolation, vascularization, and long-term survival of the transplanted islets that can reinstate insulin production, leading to normal glucose control in type 1 diabetes patients. Studies with encapsulated pancreatic beta cells show glucose flux oscillation similar to uncoated pancreatic beta cells. Purdue researchers are collaborating with scientists at the Indiana School of Medicine and performing in vivo studies of the encapsulated islets on diabetic research mice.   Advantages:-Sol-gel encapsulated islet cells are isolated from the innate immune response-Islet cell transplantation would give type 1 diabetes patients a long-term treatment option-Preliminary studies in vitro and in vivo show cells maintain viability and function after encapsulationPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals", 'Body Fluid Component Electrochemical Biosensor ': 'There is a growing need for more sensitive instruments for biological sensing. With medical research proving that even minute changes in body fluid can show early warning signs of diseases, such as cancer, biosensors need to be sufficiently sensitive to detect these changes.Purdue University researchers have developed a functioning biosensor technology that incorporates nanotubes to successfully immobilize the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx). This permits the sensing of glucose in a blood sample with greatly improved sensitivity over existing technologies, and there are expectations that this technology could be applied to monitor glucose levels in other body fluids, such as saliva. The general nature of this technology means that it could be readily adapted to sense other important body fluid components. Advantages:-Monitors minute changes in glucose levels -Could be adapted to sense other body fluid componentsPotential Applications:-Medical/Health', 'Algorithm for Measuring Blood Pressure': 'Blood pressure in the circulatory system alternates between systolic pressure (maximum) and diastolic pressure (minimum) with each heartbeat. A sphygmomanometer, a cuff placed around the upper arm to cut off blood flow in the arteries, measures these pressures.  As pressure is released from the cuff, a whooshing sound is heard when blood starts to flow in the artery (systolic).  As pressure is further released from the cuff, sound ceases when blood flow returns to normal (diastolic).These measurements are used with an algorithm to determine the systolic and diastolic pressure in the arteries. This algorithm relies on the amplitude of the oscillations measured; therefore, it is pressure dependent, reducing the accuracy of the readings.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new set of algorithms for calculating systolic and diastolic pressures. These algorithms use the mean pressure instead of the maximum oscillation amplitude to provide more accurate results than current oscillometric devices. Advantages:-Minimal modification to existing devices-Improved accuracy of the readingsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Medical Devices-Biosensors', 'Dithiocarbamate Ligands with Biosensing Applications': 'The functionalization of metal substrates with organic ligands has become a standard practice in surface science and nanomaterials chemistry. Molecular monolayers are often formed spontaneously by a simple chemisorption process. The self-assembly of alkanethiols on gold is a method for preparing surfaces with tunable physical or chemical properties or with biological recognition elements. While such self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have proven to be very useful, they are also limited by their chemical stability. Thiols can be readily oxidized to disulfides, sulfinates, or sulfonates and desorb or be displaced from the surface by other molecules. Alkanethiol-based SAMs have been shown to lack the long-term stability necessary for most biomedical applications.Purdue University researchers have developed an innovative method for coating metal surfaces with dithiocarbamate (DTC) ligands. DTC ligands can absorb onto metal surfaces with the same degree of generality as thiols, but with greater resistance to surface desorption or displacement. DTC ligands can be formed under extremely mild conditions and are especially useful for robust functionalization of metal substrates and nanoparticles intended for biological labeling and biosensing applications.

Biopsies can be obtained, polyps removed, and clear images acquired. Endoscopes are employed as a routine clinical macroscopic examination tool for many diseases and gastrointestinal problems. Confocal microscopy is the most common method for producing high quality, optically sectioned microscopic images. However, there remains an unfilled need for an improved endoscopic system with the capability of conventional wide-field imaging and confocal microscopy simultaneously in a flexible endoscopic probe. This style of endoscope could make possible histological analysis of tissues with reduced need for biopsy in many cases, decreasing pain, time requirement, and cost to the patient. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an improved endoscope and accompanying software that offer the ability to image tissues in vivo on both a gross and cellular level. The user can then effectively select one area of interest in a macroscopic view and zoom in to view the cellular information from the same area. This may make possible an immediate histological identification without the need to surgically extract biopsy samples. It will also allow physicians to examine suspected tissues in a much more methodical and thorough method than is allowed with traditional biopsy. Advantages: -Ability to perform gross and cellular imaging simultaneously -Provides a fiducial link between both levels -Allows ability to zoom in on any desired gross feature -Ability to view fluorescently labeled cellsPotential Applications: -Medical/Health-Diagnostics'}

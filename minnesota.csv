Monoclonal Anti-FAP for cancer research and therapeutic development, Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a recombinant novel monoclonal antibody that strongly and selectively binds to fibroblast activation protein alpha FAP . FAP is highly expressed in cancer associated fibroblasts in 90 of epithelial tumors including common cancers like breast colorectal lung prostate pancreatic skin and some soft tissue and bone sarcomas. FAP activity contributes to tumorigenesis and aggressiveness through degradation of the extracellular matrix and activation of growth factors. Together FAP is an attractive target for research to elucidate tumor pathogenicity and as a putative target for therapeutic intervention. The LeBeau laboratory used an antibody phage display library to develop an antibody clone B12 that selectively binds FAP and FAP expressing cells in a variety of applications. B12 recognizes FAP positive cells as evaluated by ELISA SPR flow cytometry and microscopy. Furthermore B12 can be used as a live imaging fluorescent probe in tumor xenograft models in mice by conjugating the antibody to a near infrared dye. The cross reactivity of B12 to both murine and human FAP proteins allows its use in murine preclinical cancer models and subsequent translation to relevant human cancer research and therapeutic development. Furthermore B12 shows rapid internalization by tumor cells a property lacking in another anti FAP antibody that failed in clinical trials sibrotuzumab . Anti FAP monoclonal antibody B12 represents a valuable research tool for oncology research and future humanization of the antibody could lead to the development of a promising anti cancer therapy. Validated as a research tool in both in vitro and in vivo models. This technology is now available for Please contact Kenneth Karanja to share your business needs and learn more. 
Antagomir to prevent cardiac arrhythmia, Arrhythmic cardiomyopathy can cause severe problems including cardiac arrest and death. Unfortunately many of the therapeutics to treat arrhythmias can actually have pro arrhythmic side effects. This technology is an antagomir targeting miR 448 anti miR 448 a microRNA linked to the downregulation of the sodium channel SCN5A. Relieving the inhibition of miR 448 facilitates the upregulation of SCN5A which is protective against arrhythmia while bypassing the potential pro arhythmic side effects of existing therapies.

Nanosota-1: A series of nanobody drugs to combat COVID-19, Currently there is no clinically approved drug to specifically treat the SARS CoV 2 viral infections and owing to the catastrophic nature of the pandemic there is a race to find a viable treatment. Unfortunately many traditional drug types have limitations that slow the speed at which they can be identified and developed. Small molecule drugs often suffer from relatively low specificity resulting in side effects . Conversely traditional antibody drugs often have poor pharmacokinetics are unstable and are expensive to produce. As an alternative route to avoid these limitations Dr. Fang Li s lab and Dr. Aaron LeBeau s lab at the University of Minnesota have developed a series of camelid nanobodies Nanosota 1 that are specific for the SARS CoV 2 spike protein. Nanobodies are single domain antibodies produced by camels and llamas that are much smaller than traditional antibodies but still bind with high affinity and specificity. Representative nanobodies in the Nanosota series have been experimentally shown to bind SARS CoV 2 spike protein with high affinity block binding of the protein to the human ACE2 receptor and inhibit entry into mammalian cells. Owing to their optimal therapeutic and physical properties these camelid nanobodies have high potential for development into a novel COVID 19 treatment. Development is ongoing and animal trials are underway. Preliminary results have shown that one representative nanobody protected hamsters from SARS CoV 2 infections both prophylactically and therapeutically. TRL 3 SARS CoV 2 camelid nanobodies block viral entry to mammalian cells in vitro. Preliminary pharmacokinetic studies indicate good bioavailability in an animal model that offers both prophylactic protection treatment from SARS CoV 2 infection.

Unique compounds to treat obesity, 62 928 976 More than one third of adults in the US are obese and anually 190 billion is spent on the treatment of obesity and obesity related complications. Health care providers are in need of new approaches to combat this growing health crisis. While there are many pathways in the body that control appetite and weight the final step is controlled by two receptors in the brain melanocortin receptors 3 and 4 MC3R and MC4R . Previous work research failed to identify agonists for MC3R so much effort has been put into anti obesity compounds targeting MC4R. Unfortunately these molecules have resulted in increased blood pressure in humans. Dr. Haskell Luevano at the University of Minnesota has developed the first compounds that activate MC3R while inhibiting MC4R. This unique activity profile is anticipated to increase weight loss in patients without causing hypertension. Using an uncommon but powerful screening approach Dr. Haskell Luevano identified compounds in a brand new chemical space for melanocortin agonists. As the first compounds ever reported to selectively activate MC3R these cyclized penta peptides represent promising anti obesity therapeutics. Furthermore their antagonistic activity against MC4R minimizes the risk of high blood pressure observed with previous melanocortin receptor targeting drugs. Additionally there is evidence for MC3R dependent anti inflammatory activity in vascular and lung tissue so these compounds have potential as anti inflammatory therapeutics. .

Bioink composition suitable for creating cardiac tissues, Researchers at Prof. Ogle s System Regeneration Lab have developed a novel bioink composition that supports 3D printing of biological structures. Creation of biological structures that functionally and structurally mimic native human tissues and organs has been the holy grail of tissue engineering and 3D bioprinting is being actively investigated as a means to achieve this. One of the critical challenges with bioprinting lies in formulating a bioink composition that is both suitable for printing and able to support cell proliferation. This requirement is particularly difficult to achieve when stem cells are to be grown and differentiated within the printed structures. Requirements such as cell expansion after printing timely delivery of differentiation factors prevention of undesired modifications and capacity to support cells through the differentiation process all pose additional challenges. This novel bioink composition developed at the University of Minnesota has been shown to be suitable for 3D printing to create biological structures consisting of stem cells. The researchers have demonstrated that structures printed using this bioink can Bioink prepared and tested.

Dental stem cells to treat spinal cord injury, PCT US2019 030197 Spinal cord injuries can result in serious debilitating outcomes including quadriplegia or paraplegia. There is a dire need to identify treatment strategies for this type of nervous tissue damage. Regenerative therapy has focused on the use of stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries and all related clinical trials have reported favorable safety profiles. Unfortunately these same trials have failed to show improvement in patient nerve function. Drs. Leslie Morse and Ricardo Battaglino identified dental pulp stem cells as a promising therapeutic and have developed a method to prepare these cells and subsequently used them in rat models of spinal cord injury. These dental stem cells could be developed into treatments for patients with nervous tissue injuries. The researchers found in a rodent model of spinal cord injury transplantation of dental pulp stem cells into the damaged tissue enhanced recovery through inhibiting apoptosis preserving neural fibers and differentiating into mature oligodendrocytes. Dental pulp stem cells can be derived from permanent teeth and offer a variety of advantages over current stem cell sources These neuro regenerative properties have not been observed with embryonic stem cells adult bone marrow stromal cells or other stem cell populations. Dental pulp stem cells show incredible promise in the treatment of neural damage from stroke traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury.

Antibody based treatment for Type 1 Diabetes, Type 1 diabetes T1D is a chronic incurable disease affecting 1.5 million Americans with an estimated 40 000 new cases each year. Healthcare associated expenses and lost income due to T1D is estimated at 14 billion annually. T1D is treated with regular administration of insulin however the rising cost of insulin has led patients to ration treatment with devastating effects. 1 in 4 patients have reported cost related insulin underuse resulting in poor glycemic control. Consequently premature deaths related to such non adherence are on the rise. T1D results from an autoimmune response in which the body attacks its own insulin producing pancreatic beta cells. As a result the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. This can cause complications ranging from blindness kidney failure to early death. Researchers at the University of Minnesota seeking to find new interventions for diabetes identified serpin B13 proteinase inhibitor as a potential target for diabetes treatment. The scientists developed a monoclonal antibody mAb targeting serpin B13 clone B29 that shows promise as a novel treatment strategy for T1D. When administered to diabetes prone mice the antibody reduces the number of inflammatory cells associated with an auto immune response and leads to increased proliferation of beta cells in the animals. This approach is particularly promising as a human therapeutic since studies in humans have shown that natural serpin B13 autoantibodies are associated with positive outcomes in T1D. Instructively high levels of serpin B13 autoantibodies were correlated with lower risk for T1D. Building on the efficacy observed with the mouse mAb it is anticipated that a humanized version of the antibody will prevent immunogenic effects while offering therapeutic relief. Due to its ability to reduce inflammation and induce tissue regeneration this novel humanized mouse monoclonal antibody mAb targeting serpin B13 may also prove therapeutic for inflammatory and or central nervous system diseases e.g. bone fractures ulcerated skin lesions wounds multiple sclerosis lupus hair loss etc. .

Immunostimulatory conjugates for targeted delivery as adjuvants , PCT US2019 039940 This technology encompasses novel vaccine adjuvants with limited systemic exposure. The development of vaccines based on antigen subunits have been plagued by struggles with inducing the necessary T cell response to confer protection while maintaining minimal toxicity. This technology overcomes these challenges using a two pronged approach. First the use of novel agonists for TLR7 and TLR8 trigger a prominent T cell response. Second conjugation of these agonists to a biomolecule that is trafficked to lymph nodes elicits focused immunostimulation. The sum product is a covalent conjugate that is immune silent until it travels to the lymph node where it is unmasked leading to potent adjuvantic effects with negligible systemic exposure. Due to their ability to stimulate strong T cell responses TLR7 and TLR8 agonists have been prime targets for development as adjuvants. Unfortunately their propensity to diffuse out of the vaccination site and cause systemic exposure and toxicity has been a major drawback. This technology identified novel TLR7 TLR8 stimulating compounds C2 phenolic imidazoquinoline derivatives and conjugated them to Hyaluronic Acid HA for targeting to lymph nodes. Other technologies have attempted similar lymph node delivery but the strategies or compounds employed to do so are often incredibly complex. HA as a natural biopolymer is optimal for this purpose with ideal biodegradability biocompatibility and an excellent clinical track record. HA also serves to mask the reactive portions of the agonists and the adjuvant remains unreactive until it is delivered to the target lymphoid tissue and unmasked.

Real-Time Reporter and Efficient Enzymes for DNA Editing, Base editing is an exciting new genome engineering technology. C to T mutations in genomic DNA have been achieved using ribonucleoprotein complexes comprised of rat APOBEC1 single stranded DNA deaminase Cas9 nickase Cas9n uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor UGI and guide g RNA. Here we report the first real time reporter system for quantification of APOBEC mediated base editing activity in living mammalian cells. The reporter expresses eGFP constitutively as a marker for transfection or transduction and editing restores functionality of an upstream mCherry cassette through the simultaneous processing of two gRNA binding regions that each contain an APOBEC preferred 5'TCA target site. Using this system as both an episomal and a chromosomal editing reporter we show that human APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B base editing complexes are more efficient than the original rat APOBEC1 construct. We also demonstrate coincident enrichment of editing events at a heterologous chromosomal locus in reporter edited mCherry positive cells. The mCherry reporter also quantifies the double stranded DNA cleavage activity of Cas9 and may therefore be adaptable for use with many different CRISPR systems. The combination of a rapid fluorescence based editing reporter system and more efficient structurally defined DNA editing enzymes broadens the versatility of the rapidly expanding toolbox of genome editing and engineering technologies.

Improved Pertussis Vaccine , Bordetella pertussis Bp is the bacterial agent of pertussis whooping cough in humans. Current acellular pertussis vaccines which target only a narrow range of Bp virulence factors lack efficacy in preventing respiratory tract colonization or disease transmission. Bp cell surface iron receptors are essential for the uptake of iron and are critical for growth in the host. New methods targeting Bp iron receptors have the potential to improve pertussis vaccine efficacy. Receptor based vaccines would elicit the production of antibodies that could block iron uptake starving Bp for iron and thus preventing growth. Further they could enhance immune recognition of Bp for elimination by the host immune system. This technology uses Bp receptor proteins required for the uptake of iron sources This approach targets iron receptor proteins essential for growth instead of virulence factors that are dispensable. Bp iron receptor proteins are recognized by the immune system and adding these proteins or regions of those proteins to a vaccine formulation stimulates the immune system to target those receptors. This effectively prevents Bp bacteria from obtaining the iron necessary to live and multiply and improves immune recognition for clearance. Both acellular pertussis vaccines and whole cell pertussis vaccines used in many countries could benefit. In addition the technology can be applied to veterinary vaccines for diseases caused by other Bordetella species such as canine kennel cough feline bordetellosis or atrophic rhinitis.

Bacterial Biofilms Targeted with Microbial Drone Therapeutics, Harmless common bacteria have been engineered to destroy antibiotic resistant microbial biofilms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with cystic fibrosis burn wounds prosthetic implants pneumonia cellulitis and sepsis . This technology uses a strain of Lactococcus lactis a common probiotic bacterium found in many fermented foods as well as the human body. The strain is engineered to specifically target P. aeruginosa and acts as a microbial drone that binds to the biofilm and secretes enzymes that destroy the biofilm s structure. The concept which employs surface display technology that enables the probiotic bacterium to non covalently bind to biofilm structures of choice can be adapted to target other biofilm bacteria and to express different enzymes and or antimicrobial therapeutics. While antibiotics are the standard treatment for biofilm associated infections they have relatively little effect against such infections. Newer enzymatic and bacteriophage therapies have shown some efficacy but this new technology is expected to be more effective than existing treatments and with fewer side effects. The microbial drone is potentially much more effective than antibiotics and costs substantially less to produce due in part to requiring less purification concentration and extraction than therapies using enzymes and bacteriophage. By providing a localized dose of therapy to a site of interest the drone can provide a more effective and concentrated dose while minimizing off target effects of systematic treatment e.g. antibiotic induced Clostridium difficile infections . Furthermore the host bacterium is unique in that it is a probiotic with no known issues of immunogenic responses in humans and which offers additional immunomodulatory benefits unrelated to the design.

Cryopreservation Thawing with Radiofrequency (RF) Heated Magnetic Nanoparticles , A promising technology uses radiofrequency RF excited biocompatible magnetic nanoparticles mNPs to safely and uniformly thaw large volume cryopreserved tissue samples without devitrification associated ice damage or cryoprotectant toxicity. By evenly distributing mNPs throughout a sample and applying excitation fields alternating magnetic fields the mNPs heat up very quickly hundreds of C minute and can evenly thaw larger biomaterials with less risk of damage to tissue. Keeping samples vitrified in an ice free vitreous state during cooling lessens potential damage from ice crystal formation. However during thawing problems can arise such as uneven heating devitrification ice crystallization or cracking of the sample. While smaller samples like cells or thin tissues are less prone to such problems larger samples are far more susceptible. Using higher molarity cryoprotectant solutions helps prevent crystallizing during freezing but as the molarity of such solutions increases so does the potential toxicity to tissues. This new technology aims to keep tissues viable by uniformly heating samples while also reducing toxicity to them.

Biological Imaging Provides Full Imaging of Samples, Electronic light detectors can be used to image and or map biological samples and for DNA chip analysis. In contrast to conventional biological imaging techniques this method scans across the sample and detects multiple images constructed from light emitted by the biological sample. The detector may be a linear charged couple device CCD or a CMOS image sensor which gathers slices of the sample to be combined electronically into the full image. The light emitted from the sample may include light generated by the sample itself including chemi luminescence fluorescence adsorption and quenching. The biological sample may include biological holding structures such as a DNA spot array on a DNA chip and protein bands in a 2D gel. The array allows imaging methods such as fluorescence detection from a biological sample to be analyzed.

Dystrophin Gene Targeting Method and Tools, A new method and tool have been developed for the genetic therapy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD and related genetic disorders. The dystrophin gene sequence has been genetically corrected by inserting a synthetic exon transcript into the gene code prior to the first exon in the natural coding sequence. The inserted construct ends in a stop signal that keeps transcription of mutated exons from occurring and is able to successfully code for dystrophin. The inserted synthetic exons bypass the mutated genes and allows for stronger muscle tissue and reversal of muscular dystrophy to occur. This method may also be a viable option for treatment in similar genetic disorders where the exons that cause the disease are spread out across the megabase. DMD is a recessive genetic disorder that causes muscle degeneration and eventual death through a mutation that makes the body unable to code for the protein dystrophin. In healthy bodies dystrophin is an integral component to the structure of muscle tissue and the lack of this protein causes the muscles to break down. Researchers have previously found the specific exons in the genetic code that are responsible for the production of dystrophin and it is known that it is the mutation of these exons that causes the genetic issues related to DMD. However the exons are spread across the megabase of the human genome and it is therefore difficult to correct the DMD locus. There has been little success in genetic treatments to correct the mutation responsible for the protein coding error that causes DMD.

Mass Spectrometry Software Improves Data Evaluation, The Proximity based Intensity Normalization PIN software offers improved evaluation of mass spectrometry data to identify molecules of biological interest. The algorithm dramatically improves the accuracy in the evaluation of mass spectrometry data making it useful not only for protein identification but metabolite and peptide identification. In accurately quantifying signals in mass spectrometry data normalization is important to account for variation introduced by sample handling sample loading and instrument response. PIN uses relative rather than global scaling factors to achieve this aim eliminating extraneous artifacts. Using PIN reduces the coefficient of variation by more than 50 compared with 9 25 for current methods and the Pooled Estimate Variance PEV by 69 78 compared with 9 38 for current methods . The result of using PIN is that complex peptide mixtures with statistically significant biological variation are observed which are often missed by conventional normalization techniques. Potential applications include biomarker discovery pharmaceutical studies and personalized medicine. BENEFITS OF MASS SPECTROMETRY PROXIMITY BASED INTENSITY NORMALIZATION PIN 
Controlled Drug Release with Drug Delivery System, The biocompatible polymer based drug delivery system with a controllable drug release rate can improve patient compliance. The polymer chemistry involved in the synthesis of the material allows for easy tuning of drug release to suit different application requirements. The new material is semi solid and can be easily included in topical creams or injections by simple mixing. The drug delivery system is capable of loading a wide range of drugs either hydrophobic or hydrophilic including small molecule drugs and macromolecule drugs. The polymer and its byproducts are biocompatible. A drug delivery system that requires fewer treatments can improve patient compliance. Many treatments of acute to chronic diseases require multiple injections to be administered to maintain drug levels. Patient compliance is difficult to achieve if the patient has to return to the clinic multiple times or has to administer injections at home. Polymers with controlled drug release could be a solution to this treatment hurdle. If these treatments can be given in a single injection that lasts days to weeks the success rate of the treatment will increase.

Bactericidal Lanbiotic Inhibits Gram-negative Bacteria, Lantibiotics are peptide based antimicrobial compounds produced by several types of bacteria that inhibit other closely related bacteria. The most common lantibiotic exhibits a wide range of effectiveness against most Gram positive bacteria supporting its common use in extending shelf life. However this lantibiotic is ineffective in preventing the growth of Gram negative bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. The researchers at the University of Minnesota have discovered a lantibiotic from a culture of Bifidobacterium longum a dominant species in the human intestines. This lantibiotic is the first bacteriocin described to date to have natural bactericidal and inhibitory action against both Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria including E.coli and Salmonella. The technology relates to an isolated lantibiotic that is bactericidal to both Gram negative and Gram positive microbes especially in conditions which do not damage the outer membrane of these microbes. Given that the enzymatic activities of gram negative bacteria particularly Salmonella and E. coli are responsible for widespread contamination safety recalls and consumer illness the technology has the potential to eliminate the bacterial threats presented by these and other pathogens. This inhibition and elimination of the bacterial threat can extend shelf life in a variety of food products including dairy eggs canned meat and canned seafood. It can be used as a food preservative probiotic and dietary supplement to inhibit a wider variety of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in foods such as deli meats as compared to current lantibiotics. It is a natural preservative that can displace artificial chemical preservatives giving appeal to foods as 'safe' and 'nutritious' and can be labeled as 'contains no preservatives'. As a product of Bifidobacterium longum the peptide has been sequenced partially purified and partially characterized and is on the Generally Recognized as Safe GRAS list.

Sarcoma miRNA Expression Database for Cancer Treatment, The Sarcoma miRNA Expression Database S MED provides comprehensive information about microRNA expression patterns in sarcomas and other relevant cancer tissue types helping the diagnosis classification prognosis and treatment of malignant tumors. MicroRNAs miRNAs a class of small RNAs regulating expressed genes in human sarcomas can assist in the development of cancer treatments. However miRNA expression patterns in sarcomas are poorly understood and no central information resource exists. The Sarcoma miRNA Expression Database addresses this gap by systematically providing comprehensive sarcoma miRNA expression profiles. The database is the first of its kind and not available anywhere else in the world. The database is web accessible and provides both basic and advanced search options. The Sarcoma miRNA Expression Database contains the miRNA expression patterns for 310 tissue samples representing 22 sarcoma types. The database replaces frozen tumor tissue samples the availability of which is a major challenge in studying sarcoma miRNA or gene expression patterns. The database also includes experimentally validated unique miRNA expression levels in angiosarcoma and other uncommon sarcomas. In addition the database includes miRNA expression data from normal tissues such as bone smooth muscle and skeletal muscle and from benign tumors such as neurofibroma and leiomyoma for comparative studies with their malignant counterparts. To make the information easy to understand the database uses heat maps to visualize information and color codes to represent data in absolute and relative formats. Each miRNA is linked to the database so that users can easily track its basic information. Statistical details are provided such as fold changes and P values for differentially expressed miRNAs in each sarcoma type and corresponding normal tissues. DNA microarray studies have identified differentially expressed genes in various sarcomas. Many of these genes are regulated by miRNAs. MiRNAs are non coding regulatory small RNAs that display tissue and stage specific expression. By accelerating the understanding and identification of miRNAs in sarcomas the Sarcoma miRNA Expression Database facilitates the development of miRNA based cancer biomarkers for different sarcoma subtypes. These miRNAs can also be used to differentiate the stages of the tumors i.e. primary or metastatic and the origin of the metastatic tumors. The database facilitates the diagnosis prognosis and treatment of different types of sarcomas for which very few diagnostic markers currently exist. THE SARCOMA MIRNA EXPRESSION DATABASE SERVES AS AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE TO MiRNAs were discovered relatively recently and their functions are still being studied. Our lab is the first to study miRNAs in sarcomas using cutting edge ultra high throughput detection procedures. The data in this Sarcoma miRNA Expression Database is not available through any other researchers or organizations across the globe. It would be extremely difficult for researchers to independently assemble the tumors in this dataset due to their rarity. The Sarcoma MiRNA Expression Database allows users to define the miRNA types or relationships they are interested in studying instead of being limited by previously analyzed data. This is the first database that allows users across the globe to search and view microRNA expression levels in different sarcomas through a web interface. SARCOMA MIRNA EXPRESSION DATABASE FEATURES Phase of Development The database is complete and available for licensing. Snap frozen patient tumor tissue samples were collected through the tissue procurement facility and from collaborators at the Masonic Cancer Center University of Minnesota and stored at 80 C until used.

A novel small molecule screening platform for tauopathies, 16 790 486 Despite decades of research there are currently no effective therapies for tauopathies a class of neurodegenerative disorders that include Alzheimer s disease. While recent studies have indicated that tau oligomers are the primary toxic species in these diseases very few clinical compounds that target tau itself are being pursued. To fill this gap researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed biosensors that monitor tau oligomer and monomer conformations that can be used as a high throughput screening HTS platform to identify novel compounds that modulate tau and attenuate associated toxicity. These compounds could be used in research to accelerate our understanding of tauopathies and how to treat them and or could be developed as therapeutics. The technology works through two engineered distinct fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET biosensors. The first of these biosensors measures intermolecular interactions between separate tau proteins allowing a readout of oligomerization. The second biosensor uses single molecule FRET smFRET to assess conformational changes within single tau proteins. Combined the readout from these molecular probes will facilitate identification of compounds that inhibit tau oligomerization and provide immediate insights into mechanism of action. Another major advantage of these biosensors is that they are functional in live cells allowing screening to be carried out in a biologically relevant context and without the need for costly and time consuming purification protocols.

Kinase assay to aid in development of therapeutics for acute myeloid leukemia, Fms like tyrosine kinase 3 FLT3 kinase is one of the most frequently mutated genes in acute myeloid leukemia AML . Early studies have shown that mutations in FLT3 are correlated with poor long term prognosis with increased risk for relapse. To assess FLT3 activity Laurie Parker s lab at the University of Minnesota designed substrates phosphorylated by FLT3 in a manner that is highly efficient and specific. Coupled with fluorescent and or mass spectrometric readouts these peptides are valuable tools in both drug discovery and diagnostics for FLT3 linked AML. The developed FLT3 artificial substrates FAS A is compatible with living cells and facilitates rapid detection of kinase activity in real time. When compared to alternatives FAS A is phosphorylated 200 more effectively than the only other FLT3 substrate reported in the literature FLT3tide . Due to its high selectivity FAS A can be used in complex lysates or mixtures and with negligible off target effects and can be multiplexed with other assays. Finally the phosphorylation of the substrate can be measured using ELISA mass spectrometry or through incorporation of terbium binding segments facilitating a fluorescent readout. This flexibility facilitates the use of the substrate in a wide variety of applications including high throughput and drug discovery methods. Multiple designed substrates of wildtype and mutant forms of FLT3 assessed in vitro. This technology is now available for 
CoFe nanowires for remote heating using an alternating magnetic field, Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a CoFe based magnetic nanowire material that generates heat when placed in an alternating magnetic field. High saturation magnetization and magnetic anisotropy of this material makes it ideal for applications that require remote rapid and uniform heating. Additionally on demand alignment of these nanowires offers higher heating rates up to 1000 C min . Furthermore these nanowires can be coated with chemical agents to improve shelf life buoyancy dispersibility and biocompatibility. Low cellular toxicity makes this material suitable for applications in thawing of cryopreserved tissues and organs medical hyperthermia treatments for ablation of diseased tissues and medical imaging. Proof of Concept. The researchers have fabricated nanowires in 1 2 gram batches. The material has been evaluated for heating rates in cryoprotectants and tested for cytotoxicity in vitro in the presence of alternating magnetic fields.

Efficient release of affinity-captured cells, 15 491 233 Affinity based cell separation is a technique in which affinity between a cell surface biomarker and a complimentary substrate bound capture ligand is used to capture specific cells. Affinity based cell separation offers key advantages such as simplicity high specificity and label free isolation. The captured target cells are released via a variety of methods including shear force substrate deformation chemical or enzymatic treatment. However these approaches have several disadvantages such as Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a method to release affinity captured cells using a molecular release mechanism that does not damage or alter the cells. This technology uses a molecular recognition and release trigger approach that is independent of the capture mechanism thereby making this method versatile and readily adaptable for any cell type. After capturing the cells large specific non toxic molecular trigger compounds are immobilized adjacent to the ligand cell complexes as the captured trigger compounds adopt an extended conformation the ligand biomarker bond is broken releasing the captured cells. Combined with affinity based cell capturing this release technology offers a comprehensive widely adaptable platform for effective cell sorting. In vitro assessment human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVECs were successfully isolated from a solution containing HUVECs and OVCAR3 cells. A release efficiency of over 97 is reported.

"An accurate, high throughput method to measure site-specific ubiquitin abundance", Lysine ubiquitination is an essential posttranslational modification in eukaryotic cells and is involved in a multitude of cellular processes including DNA damage and repair subcellular localization and protein degradation. Alterations in ubiquitination of proteins are linked to many serious diseases including cancer neurodegenerative diseases and immunologic disorders. However a reliable specific and rapid method to analyze lysine ubiquitination does not exist. A new technology developed at the University of Minnesota uses a chemical proteomics approach to specifically label ubiquitinated lysine residues in proteins using an isotopically labeled acetylglycylglycyl NHS tag. This tag distinguishes unmodified lysine residues in the protein of interest from ubiquitinated lysine residues and allows for quantification using mass spectrometry. Data has shown that this approach termed isotopically balanced quantification of ubiquitination IBAQ Ub is reliable specific and has the potential to be developed into a high throughput method to measure ubiquitination abundance. Compared to the current methods used to assess protein ubiquitination IBAQ Ub does not require the use of site specific antibodies or an extra enrichments step saving both time and money. Furthermore this technique does not rely on in vitro synthesis of isotopically labeled standards required by other methods i.e. AQUA and as such could enable global untargeted discoveries of physiologically relevant changes in protein ubiquitination. With further development IBAQ Ub could have clinical applications and be used to be used for biomarker studies of patient tissues.

Matrix for Storage of Biofluid Specimens and Biological Drugs at Room Temperature, 15 349 441 Cryogenic storage is the predominant method of storing biological samples in healthcare and scientific research. However a single 80 C freezer uses the same amount of energy as an average US household and is prone to power failure that could destroy the samples. This exorbitant cost is prohibitive in resource limited regions making specimen collection and storage unfeasible. Furthermore the harsh freeze thaw processing of samples leads to degradation of numerous proteinaceous biomolecules. This preservation technique is also problematic for increasingly prevalent biological drugs that require stabilization. Currently this class of drugs is often freeze dried a process that can cause aggregation formulation of insoluble aggregates or crystallization of the drug. The new room temperature stabilization technology provides solutions to both of these problems using a novel matrix of modified polysaccharides that stabilize biofluid specimens at non cryogenic temperatures 4 C to room temperature in a dried state for long term storage. University of Minnesota researchers developed a technology that employs an electrospun fibrous matrix of polysaccharides onto which a biofluid specimen or biological drug can be applied and subsequently dried vitrified under vacuum. This process creates a mixture of polysaccharides and biological materials in a glass solid that entraps and stabilizes macromolecules for long term storage at non cryogenic temperatures. In the formulation for increased biomolecular preservation the end groups of the polysaccharide sugar dextran was reduced from an aldehyde to a relatively inert alcohol forming dextranol and eliminating the creation of protein dextran conjugates. This method has been shown to effectively preserve samples minimizing sample aggregation often observed during cryopreservation and leading to 90 100 recovery of biomarkers assayed including those that are refractory to freezing . This technology represents the first ever alternative to cryogenic preservation of a broad range of proteinaceous biomarkers and serum metabolites and facilitates research and medicine in underdeveloped and rural environments. Identifying cancer biomarkers may allow early disease detection monitoring of disease progression and or therapeutic response and could one day reduce mortality improve quality of life and minimize healthcare costs. However this discovery and validation process has been slow to progress and of the thousands of molecular signatures being evaluated less than two dozen have been approved by the FDA due in part to poor stability and less than optimal biospecimen storage conditions. The considerably less stringent storage requirements afforded by this technology will be valuable in keeping samples viable for future research facilitating the process of biomarker discovery and validation.

Biomarker for Diagnosis of Aggressive Breast Cancer , A novel metabolomics method can detect pre invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells by measuring aerobic glycolysis conversion of glucose to lactate . The ability of cancer cells to produce lactate through aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer and increased glucose uptake and elevated aerobic glycolysis are closely correlated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Pre invasive or metastatic cancer cells have dramatically increased production of 3 13C lactate produced from 1 13C glucose over non invasive cancer cells. By measuring the rate of aerobic glycolysis which closely correlates with glucose uptake and lactate production in cancer cells this technology may enable development of a biomarker for diagnosing pre invasive or metastatic cancer. Although increased mammography screenings have detected more ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS it has not reduced breast cancer death from metastatic breast cancer. The majority of the DCIS never becomes metastatic and it is unclear why certain DCIS lesions develop into invasive breast cancer. No reliable biomarkers or screenings i.e. mammography MRI for pre invasive breast cancer currently exist because none can distinguish pre invasive breast cancer from indolent breast tumor or benign breast lump or lesion. This new technology however can distinguish pre invasive cancer from benign breast diseases or indolent breast tumors. This diagnostic test may prevent unnecessary breast biopsies. It may also be used to monitor therapeutic response and progression of metastatic cancer either alone or in conjunction with PET CT. 
Algorithm for Discovering Genetic Interactions in Genome-Wide Association Studies , BridGE Bridging Gene Sets with Epistasis is an innovative computational method that explicitly searches for disease specific genetic interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in Genome wide Association Studies GWAS data. The algorithm searches for larger non random structures of SNP SNP interactions guided by established sets of genes belonging to characterized pathways or gene modules. The concept was derived from extensive analysis of genetic interaction networks in yeast which showed that genetic interactions tend to cluster between functionally compensatory pathways. If several SNPs interact between genes coding for proteins pathways with redundant functions the likelihood of obtaining statistical significance by searching for larger clusters of SNP SNP interactions is much greater than if individual SNP interactions were considered separately. Applying BridGE broadly significant interactions were discovered in Parkinson s disease schizophrenia hypertension prostate cancer type 2 diabetes and breast cancer. Detecting genetic interactions is important for fully characterizing heritability of complex diseases within Genome Wide Association Studies GWAS . Current methods for detecting such genetic interactions are inaccurate lacking statistical power and failing to reliably detect genetic interactions important for characterizing the heritability of complex diseases. By explicitly searching GWAS data for disease specific genetic interactions between pathways BridGE identifies large non random clusters that tend to contain genetic interactions. The technology has the potential to transform interpretation of human genome data and expand the therapeutic target space for complex genetic diseases.

Developing Highly Specific Monoclonal Antibodies to Peptide in the Context of MHC II, A novel approach generates monoclonal antibodies MAb against peptide presented in major histocompatibility complex II MHC II . The methodology centers on having a soluble peptide MHC p MHC Class II complex linked to biotin as the B cell antigenic target. The approach uses recombinant peptide MHC monomers as immunogens and subsequently relies on multimers to enrich the responding antigen specific B cells prior to fusion and screening. It first immunizes a subject with a composition comprising an antigen isolates a population of cells from the subject and enriches a subpopulation of those cells and then forms a hybridoma using a cell from the subpopulation. This technology sets the standard for generating monoclonal antibodies against peptide MHC and could be used for any MAb protein target not just p MHC II . Monoclonal antibodies specific for foreign antigens auto antigens allogeneic antigens and tumor neo antigens in the context of major histocompatibility complex II MHC II are highly desirable. However there is no standard protocol for generating monoclonal antibodies that recognize peptide in the context of MHC II and only a limited number of such reagents exist. The unique approach to producing and screening monoclonal antibodies specific for peptide bound to MHC II has several advantages BENEFITS AND FEATURES gt APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Pre clinical validation. In vitro and in vivo proof of concept is completed. 
Magnetic Resonance Electrical Properties Tomography, A spatial gradient based electrical property tomography EPT method uses magnetic resonance imaging MRI to produce non invasive and high spatial resolution in vivo imaging of electrical conductivity and permittivity of biological tissues. Electrical properties are determined based on estimated radiated gradient values of the electrical properties of the object. For example electrical property maps are reconstructed using a spatial integration on gradient values estimated from the magnitude and relative phase values derived from measurements of multiple transmit and receive B1 fields. Using a 7 Tesla MRI system results report high quality in vivo human brain electrical property images with refined structural details which can potentially merit clinical diagnosis such as cancer detection. Furthermore a G algorithm uses B1 maps to generate specific absorption rate SAR maps that can also be produced based on the estimated electrical properties. The FDA places guidance limits on heating and specific absorption rate SAR in humans during magnetic resonance imaging MRI but there is currently no way to measure SAR locally. Generic numerical SAR models which are not patient specific estimate worst case values. As a result MRI pulse sequences are often designed conservatively with large safety margins potentially hindering the full potential of high field systems. In addition current electrical properties tomography EPT techniques generate SAR maps that are too noisy to be useable. Electrical property tomography EPT holds promise for non invasive and high spatial resolution imaging of the electrical conductivity and permittivity of biological tissues in vivo using a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. This technology is a novel gradient based EPT approach with greatly improved tissue boundary reconstruction and largely elevated robustness against measurement noise compared to existing techniques. It also features a novel EPT G algorithm that generates SAR maps based on conductivity and permittivity with potentially sufficient fidelity to accurately measure local SAR.

Particle Swarm Optimization for Programming Neuromodulation Systems, An algorithm using particle swarm optimization PSO in programming electrodes in deep brain stimulation arrays DBSAs provides clinicians with an intuitive semi automated approach for programming multi electrode neuromodulation systems. The system and methods optimize deep brain stimulation DBS therapy by producing a range of optimal electrode configuration solutions that can achieve a number of objectives such as maximizing neural activation of a region of interest minimizing activation in a region where stimulation is not desired minimizing battery power consumption and maximizing the closeness to sources of sensed functional data. The computed solutions are presented visually to clinicians via Pareto front visualization enabling them to intuitively select a stimulation setting that matches desired activation outcomes and programming goals for each specific patient. One of the biggest clinical challenges associated with multiple electrode DBS leads is the countless possible combinations of electrode configurations as well as inefficient and time consuming trial and error methods entailed in optimizing multiple objectives. Particle Swarm Optimization PSO is a well known occurrence in biology in which complex collective behaviors emerge out of swarms of individual organisms. This technology s algorithm uses PSO to identify electrode configurations and stimulation settings optimized for a variety of objectives. By identifying a range of optimal settings the clinician has a starting point with which to increase or decrease the overall amount of current delivered to the patient. This new approach is particularly robust when axonal activation could reasonably occur along multiple points along a given axon and is robust to variation of maximum electrode currents on each site. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Pilot scale demonstration 
Black-Blood T1 Myocardial Mapping to Remove Partial Voluming Effects, A magnetic resonance imaging MRI sequence which allows for complete blood suppression during quantitative imaging can improve the robustness of quantitative myocardial tissue characterization. The technique which can be used in commercially available MRI scanners with no additional hardware improves diagnostic capabilities by suppressing blood signals from quantitative maps. The technique helps reduce partial voluming effects at the myocardium blood interface and enables robust quantification of myocardial tissue characteristics independent of myocardial thickness or slice orientation. The sequence may be used for quantitative assessment of the endocardial myocardium a typical scar area in left ventricular hypertrophy. Eliminating partial voluming further reduces false positives in patients with reduced myocardial wall thickness or young healthy subjects who commonly have thin myocardial walls. Quantitative myocardial tissue characterization is a newer yet crucial technology in cardiac MRI. It provides quantitative insights in myocardial tissue composition in numerous cardiac diseases. The technique provides greater diagnostic and prognostic capabilities with greater repeatability and has shown clinical value in diagnosing numerous cardiomyopathies. However the high signal from blood pools adjacent to the myocardium corrupts these measurements due to partial voluming effects and this corruption requires careful expert evaluation of the maps to read the results. In addition partial voluming effects restricts the tool s applicability to the mid myocardium and reduces its applicability to subjects with thin myocardia. This newly developed black blood quantitative imaging sequence when applied to myocardial T1 mapping completely suppresses the blood signal and therefore improves quantitative characterization of the heart. Furthermore the results show improved inter and intra observer reproducibility for data analysis. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Pilot scale demonstration. Have published results on eight healthy volunteers. 
Endometrial Cancer Recurrence Risk Biomarker, Analysis of recent human clinical samples determined that patients with high levels of ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase 14 USP14 were six times more likely to experience recurrence of endometrial cancer than patients with low levels. In addition higher USP14 levels added predictive value even when disease grade was known. No biomarkers are currently available to assess the risk of recurrence of endometrial cancer the most common form of gynecological cancer in the United States. Since USP14 staining intensity can be determined pre operatively via biopsy along with grade this technology could help low risk patients avoid aggressive surgery and or lymph node dissection and guide high risk patients toward surgical and adjuvant therapy regimens likely to improve their outcomes. USP14 is not only a biomarker for recurrent disease but a potential therapeutic target as well. The data show a strong positive correlation between the intensity of USP14 staining and degree of proliferation of endometrial cancer in situ suggesting that highly proliferating cells may be more dependent on USP14 activity. Further the data showed that pharmacological inhibition of USP14 with the FDA approved inhibitor VLX1570 reduced cell viability of endometrial cancer cells. BENEFITS AND FEATURES OF USP14 AS A BIOMARKER FOR ASSESSING RISK OF ENDOMETRIAL CANCER RECURRENCE Phase of Development Assay development pre clinical validation 
Gut Microbiome Analysis for Detecting Colon Cancer Mutations, Analyzing the microbiome of colon cancer microenvironments can detect colorectal cancer CRC and even predict specific types of mutations present in a tumor. This new non invasive method was developed by analyzing fecal swabs from tumor microenvironment microbial communities and found that specific tumor mutations were associated with specific gut bacteria. In fact results found a correlation between the presence and abundance of specific bacterial taxa with loss of function LOF mutations in certain genes. The method includes a kit comprised of probes and or primers used for detecting specific bacterial taxa in the colon mucosa and stool microbiomes of CRC cancer patients. The method might also be employed as a non invasive screening for the presence or increased risk of colon cancer. While DNA sequencing of stool microbiomes has previously detected colon cancer in a non invasive manner this method is unique in that it can detect or predict specific types of mutations without having to sequence the exome or genome of tumor cells. Using only the taxonomic profile of the microbial community from the tumor microenvironment this method can predict whether certain types of mutations are present in a particular tumor s genome insight which may lead to increased efficacy of treatment.

Circulating Tumor Cell Detection with New Reagents, It has been determined that circulating breast cancer cells differentially express a specific type of membrane protein and have developed immune reagents that bind selectively to this protein. These reagents could be used for more effective detection of breast cancer circulating tumor cells CTCs and could also help develop methods to deliver therapeutic agents to metastatic cancer cells. This new method is highly sensitive and eliminates the need for enrichment steps. Tumor metastasis is the primary cause of cancer related deaths. Early detection of CTCs has emerged as an important new prognostic and stratification procedure. CELLSEARCH is the only available FDA approved CTC detection system. It detects a tumor cell surface marker called EpCAM however studies have shown that a majority of CTCs don t express EpCAM. Furthermore EpCAM negative CTCs may be more metastatic than those that are EpCAM positive. Improved methods are needed for CTC detection. BENEFITS AND FEATURES OF MARKER TO IDENTIFY BREAST CANCER CTCS Phase of Development In vitro and in vivo assessment. Mouse data show the immune reagents specifically identify CTCs. 
Reagent for Dual Protein Labeling, A new versatile reagent can make dual simultaneous site specific protein modifications in one reaction and a wide range of conjugates including protein protein protein nucleotide protein polymers and protein small molecule couplings. The reagent uses the enzyme PFTase which is small specific and fast acting. The reagent is non toxic and allows nearby biological processes to continue undisrupted. This reagent has several distinct advantages over similar protein modification methods. Most current methods for site specific protein modifications only allow one modification at a time. Many methods utilize copper which can be toxic to surrounding biological processes. Current protein tagging methods often use organic solvents and cytotoxic catalysts that are expensive difficult to obtain and result in uncontrolled modification at nonspecific sites. The new reagent allows for multiple modifications at one time does not require copper utilizes more accessible materials and achieves highly specific site modifications. In addition this reagent is attachable to nearly any protein further broadening potential applications. Protein modification is an important process for studying protein function developing protein tags and drug development. Adding conjugates or chemical modifications such as PEG or fluorophores to proteins is a crucial step in protein visualization. For protein biotherapeutics protein tags can improve specificity potency and the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug. BENEFITS AND FEATURES OF DUAL PROTEIN LABELING REAGENT Phase of Development Proof of concept demonstrated by adding dual protein labels to multiple proteins 
FRET Based Assay to Discover Modulators of RyR Calcium Channels, A fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET assay method for monitoring and testing the interactions between protein molecules in a high throughput sample setting has been developed. The FRET system is able to test pharmaceuticals by attaching fluorescent derivatives to pairs of targeted proteins and mixing these with the drug that is being researched. This FRET method is applicable to the testing of any protein interactions. The FRET high throughput screening method has been validated with known specific modulators of the ryanodine receptor RyR calcium channels. This method allows screening of large libraries of small molecule compounds to identify inhibitors of pathological calcium leak through the RyR channels. Emerging drug candidates are expected to be effective for treatment of muscle diseases muscular dystrophy muscle fatigue irregular heartbeat heart failure diabetes neurological diseases Alzheimer s Parkinson s and other pathologies associated with abnormal calcium leak through RyR. This is the first high throughput screening technology for RyR calcium channels. BENEFITS AND FEATURES OF RYR CALCIUM CHANNEL FRET BASED ASSAY Phase of Development Proof of Concept 
Blood Sugar Regulation with D-serine, Systemic administration of D serine has been shown to alter blood sugar levels in mice. An acute high dose injection of D serine or a genetic mutation leading to endogenously elevated levels of D serine resulted in hypoglycemia compared to controls in mice. Human islets secreted more insulin in response to glucose when exposed to D serine under target activating conditions. Prolonged high concentration exposure to D serine led to reversible hyperglycemia in mice and a loss of islet viability. These results implicate D serine in the mechanisms of blood sugar regulation and in the symptoms etiology of progressive forms of diabetes. NMDA receptors are widely expressed in the brain as well as in some peripheral tissues including the pancreas. To be activated NMDA receptors need an agonist like glutamate and a co agonist. D serine is the strongest natural co agonist activator of NMDA receptors currently identified by scientists. Because insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas contain NMDA receptors it is expected that D serine treatments can be used to manipulate these pancreatic cells in order to change insulin release and blood sugar levels. D serine treatments could be used to control type II diabetes. A patient could take a D serine pill before meals to improve glucose tolerance or with another diabetic therapy to improve hyperglycemic control and or to minimize the dose or frequency of insulin injections. Genetic mutations to D serine regulatory genes or to D serine s co agonist NMDA receptor target site could be used to identify individuals with diabetic susceptibility and to predict diabetic subtypes or assess treatment approach. In clinical trials where D serine was tested as a treatment for schizophrenia and other neurological disorders results indicated that oral D serine treatments have a low level of side effects at biologically active doses. BENEFITS AND FEATURES OF D SERINE TREATMENT Phase of Development In vivo animal studies in vitro human tissue 
Bovine Tuberculosis Screening, A bovine and human screening method has been developed that is capable of specifically diagnosing subclinical tuberculosis infection. The test uses pathogen serum proteins as reliable biomarkers to detect subclinical evidence of M. bovis infection quicker than current methods. Unlike procedures that lack biological specificity this method solely identifies bovine tuberculosis and does not require blood processing to happen within 24 hours of the sample collection. The circulation of the pathogen peptides and host response proteins can track disease progression of human tuberculosis as well making this diagnostic test effective at quickly determining the risk of illness in various organisms. Bovine tuberculosis is one of the most damaging zoonotic diseases today. There exists a need for rapid inexpensive diagnostics capable of detecting and differentiating M. bovis from other pathogenic and environmental mycobacteria at multiple surveillance levels. Unambiguous subclinical detection in the early stages of infection is a critical point of prevention and control of bovine tuberculosis. However current methods for diagnosis rely on immune responses that may indicate a widespread infection already underway. Pathogen specific biomarkers to predict the disease using diagnostics with improved accuracy are necessary to prevent dangerous outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis. BENEFITS AND FEATURES OF SCREENING METHOD FOR BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS Phase of Development First stage validation complete 
Reelin Protein Diagnostic Test for Mental Disorders, The alterations in Reelin levels occur in significantly specific amounts in schizophrenic autistic majorly depressed and bipolar patients. A Reelin diagnostic blood test aids in the diagnoses and differentiation of autism major depression bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This test also monitors patient medication compliance which results in a greater likelihood of patient obedience. This diagnostic test allows neuropsychiatrists to make a quick accurate diagnosis of mental illnesses and behavioral disorders. This means that clinicians are able to start behavior therapy or prescribe medication earlier resulting in improved patient outcomes. View the Term Sheet Contact Raj Udupa for more information. The diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders centers on the patient's symptoms and the observational data of clinicians. Examples of some mental disorders are schizophrenia autism major depression and bipolar disorder. Reelin is a secretory glycoprotein required for normal lamination in the brain and is a biomarker for mental disorders. Alterations in the peripheral blood levels of reelin are the foundation for the diagnostic test of neuropsychiatric disorders. This diagnostic test allows neuropsychiatrists to make a quick accurate diagnosis of mental illnesses and behavioral disorders and clinicians are able to start behavior therapy or prescribe medication earlier resulting in improved patient outcomes. Another advantage of the diagnostic test is that it eliminates some of the stress associated with neuropsychiatric disorder diagnosis. It also removes the difficulty of ruling in or out a neuropsychiatric disorder the test is invaluable when a patient appears borderline 'normal' or may be borderline for multiple mental disorders such as major depression and bipolar depression. A Reelin diagnostic blood test aids in the diagnoses and differentiation of autism major depression bipolar disorder and schizophrenia the basis of the test is the pathology of neuropsychiatric diseases. The alterations in Reelin levels occur in significantly specific amounts in schizophrenic autistic majorly depressed and bipolar patients. Study data demonstrates that altered levels of Reelin correlate with the subjective evaluation of patients with suspected disease. Also this diagnostic test aids in patient compliance with required medications. BENEFITS OF THE REELIN PROTEIN DIAGNOSTIC TEST Product Details This product includes the detailed protein structure of the biomarker Reelin and also details the mechanism of action of Reelin in the brain. Phase of Development Proof of the concept has been established. Currently additional validation studies mechanistic studies and preliminary case control studies are underway and available. 
Genetic Modification of Endostatin: An Anti-Angiogenic Therapeutic, A method to improve anti angiogenic proteins has been developed to create proteins with an increased potency so that higher efficacy may be achieved by lower doses. Through structural modifications an anti cancer compound derived from the native endostatin molecule can be modified. The composition of this modified endostatin molecule contains a targeting moiety specific for endothelial cells that is linked to an anti angiogenic moiety. These modifications allow for an increased potency and higher efficacy over native endostatin while being provided in lower dosages than in current clinical use of angiostatin. Endostatin and angiostatin are protein fragments of collagen type XVIII and plasminogen respectively which inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and thereby inhibit angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is critical for tumor growth and metastasis. Limitations on the clinical use of angiostatin proteins include the need for a high dose and or prolonged therapies. Second generation anti angiogenic molecules developed using this technology can be useful in cancer therapy diabetic retinopathy macular degeneration and restenosis resulting from balloon angioplasty. Additional applications include other diseases where inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation is desired. BENEFITS OF ANTI ANGIOGENIC MOLECULES FROM MODIFIED ENDOSTATIN 
Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Disease Treatment, A pharmaceutical compound consisting of stable glutathione GSH analogs has been developed to treat Alzheimer's disease AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. The GSH analogs fulfill key roles of endogenous GSH and resist enzyme breakdown while acting as a substrate for the detoxifying enzyme glyoxalase I. The GSH analogs treat AD through two mechanisms. Amyloid beta A plaques a hallmark of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases are caused by A protein aggregation. A aggregation is induced through glycation. Glyoxalase I curbs glycation but this process is dependent on GSH which is severely depleted in an AD affected brain. The new GSH analogs treat AD progression by restoring glyoxalase I activity in the brain which decreases glycation and hampers glycation induced A aggregation and in turn plaque formation. The GSH analogs are able to pass through the blood brain barrier to neutralize oxidative stress in the brain. Oxidative stress is a root cause of neurodegenerative disorders as well as other diseases. The new GSH analogs are the first compounds to replicate endogenous GSH activity while resisting breakdown. Other compounds which have tried to mimic the role of GSH failed because they were not resistant to breakdown. This treatment could be used in conjunction with other AD treatments or used independently. This AD treatment can be used earlier than any other existing treatments. Separately the GSH analogs were found to have hepatoprotective qualities. The analogs react directly with N acetyl p benzoquinoneimine NAPQI a toxic by product produced during acetaminophen metabolism. Using the GSH analogs in combination with acetaminophen could improve overall safety. The analogs could also act as a rescue treatment for acute acetaminophen overdose. BENEFITS AND FEATURES OF GSH ANALOGS COMPOUND Phase of Development In vitro and in vivo data available 
Modified Sleeping Beauty Transposon Gene Transfer System, The modified Sleeping BeautyTM SB transposon allows even greater application to various areas of biotechnology and human therapy. The synthetic transposon system uses modified Sleeping Beauty vectors to accomplish a wide range of applications in functional genomics. For example the vectors can be used to identify and characterize genomic coding sequences and localize gene expression. This system can also be used to identify isolate and characterize transcriptional regulatory sequences. The modification of SB also allows for gene transfer and long term expression of genes in chromosomes. The transfer of new genes into a cell allows for the restoration of defective or missing functions in the genome. This aspect of the SB technology makes it useful in applications such as therapeutic gene therapy which has the potential to treat genetic diseases such as hemophilia and sickle cell anemia. BENEFITS OF THE MODIFIED SLEEPING BEAUTYTM GENE TRANSFER SYSTEM 
Turkey Production Improvements, Two methods for the enhancement of turkey performance are presented one technology works to increase the turkey growth rate and muscle mass of hens by using a passive immunization method to block myostatin s inhibitory effects on skeletal muscle development. The other technology utilizes the effects the eyes seem to have on the gonads in order to provide poultry with the optimal combination of light wavelengths to induce the most stimulatory effects. View the Term Sheet Contact BJ Haun for specific details. This license includes technologies Z00173 and Z02041. Turkeys are unique in that their eyes seem to play a role in their reproductive cycle. The eyes appear to have an inhibitory effect on the gonads and respond to different wavelengths and intensity of light. These inhibitory effects seem to be the most sensitive to the green yellow part of the spectrum 520 575 nm and are most stimulated by the opposite portion of the spectrum the red 630 nm wavelength. This technology utilizes the effects of light wavelength on the eyes in order to enhance the reproductive efficiency of poultry. Reproductive performance is enhanced by controlling the type of light to which poultry is exposed preferably increasing red bands while minimizing green yellow bands for multiple predetermined lengths of time. Myostatin GDF 8 is a member of the growth factor family which plays an important role in regulating development and growth. Myostatin is expressed in the skeletal muscles and seems to act as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. This technology works to reduce the inhibitory effects of myostatin on skeletal muscle development in order to stimulate growth rates in turkey hens. The turkeys are given an active immunization against myostatin which causes them to produce antibodies that will be transferred to poults through the eggs and induce a passive immunization response in the offspring. The advantage of this technology is that there is no need for drug administration to animals directly or use of a transgenic animal to interfere with myostatin s inhibitory effects on skeletal muscle growth. This technology also provides a safer method to increase turkey growth rate of muscle mass with fewer side effects and without an increase in fat content. 
Lupus Treatments Possible with Identification of High Risk Haplotype, Researchers have identified a high risk genetic combination of DNA sequences called a haplotype for systemic lupus erythmatosus SLE . Systemic lupus erythmatosus is the most common form of lupus and the most serious. Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues and organs. There is currently no cure for lupus but the disease is manageable by treating the symptoms associated with it. This risk haplotype for SLE alters the gene associated with over expression of the protein IRF 5 compared to individuals not carrying the risk haplotype. View the Term Sheet Contact Raj Udupa for specific details. The identification of the causal mechanism of lupus has the potential to generate a cure for the disease. A genetic therapy or treatment targeting the at risk haplotype would prevent flares of lupus and block symptoms from showing. Treatments for this disease would focus on the splice patterns of the haplotype and the over expression of IRF 5 to mute the disease. Such a treatment could greatly improve the lives of patients suffering from lupus. These patients currently endure multiple treatments and therapies for their symptoms and experience shorter lives. The method for developing a new treatment for Lupus could be useful in finding treatments for other autoimmune diseases with similar mechanisms. BENFITS OF IDENTIFYING THE HIGH RISK HAPLOTYPE FOR LUPUS AND DEVELOPING NEW TREATMENTS 
Novel small molecules for chemotherapy sensitization, Topoisomerase II topo II or Top2 poisons are a major class of drugs widely used to treat cancers including testicular cancer lung cancer lymphoma leukemia neuroblastoma and ovarian cancer. These drugs work by generating DNA damage. However drug resistance can limit the efficacy of treatment. Human tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase II TDP2 counteracts the effect of Top2 poisons thus repairing the damaged DNA and leading to chemotherapeutic resistance. To mitigate this form of cancer drug resistance Dr .Zhengqiang Wang University of Minnesota and Dr. Yves Pommier National Cancer Institute developed novel phenoxyphenyldeazaflavin compounds that effectively inhibit TDP2 in cancer cell lines. Through the inhibition of DNA damage repair machinery these compounds functionally sensitize cancer cells toward widely used anticancer Top2 poisons. While previous deazaflavin compounds inhibit TDP2 in biochemical assays they have not shown strong efficacy in cancer cells. This new technology which modifies the critical structure of the deazaflavin core generates the first ever compounds that demonstrate strong efficacy in cancer cell lines. Using these new compounds in conjunction with Top2 poisons cancer therapies inhibits TDP2 keeping Top2 poisons effective and preventing resistance. At concentrations as low as 3 nM one of the deazaflavin analogs substantially increased the intracellular concentration of Top2 poisons likely by inhibiting transporter mediated efflux. This modality will allow the technology to be used much more broadly in combination with cancer drugs which suffer from poor efficacy due to efflux. This technology is now available for 
Novel process to obtain large quantities of primary cells for transplantation, Cell transplantation is a promising therapeutic technique for the treatment of end stage liver disease acute liver failure and some liver based metabolic disorders. However there remains a need for an on demand supply of large numbers of high quality primary human hepatocytes. Current cryopreservation techniques damage cells and fall far short of being able to produce the required quantities of functioning hepatocytes for treatment. Work in John Bischof s lab at the University of Minnesota has developed a method to infuse organs with a cryopreservation solution containing magnetic nanoparticles prior to freezing that allows them to be rewarmed usingalternating magnetic fields. The solution and nanoparticles are subsequently washed out and this technique avoids the damage typically caused during the thawing processes and facilitates the recovery of large quantities of functional cells. Execution of the developed method may be used to recover and produce large numbers 1010 or greater of functional cells. Of particular importance is that in animal models this technique has been shown capable of isolating high quality cells even from livers donated after cardiac death DCD which are typically considered suboptimal and of little use for donation. Furthermore since cell isolation happens after thawing the organ the organ can be transported over long distances and extended periods of time this facilitates identification of an ideal patient match and mitigates rejection risks. This approach can also be optimized for organs other than the liver including kidney heart pancreas and lungs among other . This method has the capacity to make use of thousands of donated organs that would typically be discarded saving countless lives through facilitating cell transplants and the creation of bioartificial organs. Study in animal models has illustrated the ability to recover large quantities of high quality hepatocytes from harvested livers including those recovered after cardiac death that have undergone ischemic warming. This technology is now available for 
Tosedostat (CHR-2797) as a Potential Analgesic, 16 353 974 Tosedostat an anti cancer drug also known as CHR 2797 shows promise as a potential analgesic. The compound has significant analgesic activity and is synergistic with morphine in mouse models. Tosedostat is an aminopeptidase inhibitor that blocks the inactivation of endogenous opioid peptides enkephalins by aminopeptidases enkephalinases . This inhibition allows enkephalins to remain in the body longer than they normally would providing extended analgesic effect by binding to and opioid receptors in the periphery. This method of use is unlikely to overstimulate pain related receptors thus reducing risk of tolerance dependency or addiction. Tosedostat as an analgesic could work in combination with or even replace current analgesic compounds. Prescription painkillers like morphine and other opioids have high abuse potential and often lead to dependency addiction and increased tolerance. In addition they can induce severe adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting constipation respiratory depression and sedation. Alternatives to opioids like steroidal and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs face other drawbacks. These drugs can induce serious side effects such as ulcers bleeding and kidney and liver toxicity. Using Tosedostat as an analgesic allows the body s natural opioid peptides enkephalins to exert an analgesic effect. Because the analgesic effect is restricted to the periphery i.e. the compound works outside the brain risk of dependence addiction increased tolerance or respiratory depression could be reduced or even eliminated. Repurposing Tosedostat for analgesia may provide a pain relief alternative with reduced adverse effects. And because Tosedostat has undergone human clinical trials for anticancer activity its toxicity and side effects are already being evaluated and studied extensively.

Increased efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, Genome editing using CRISPR Cas9 has promised to deliver incredible capabilities for precise genome editing. While this approach is incredibly robust at targeting highly specific sites in the genome to induce double stranded breaks DSB these sites are most frequently repaired by non homologous end joining NHEJ that results in small unspecific insertions or deletions of DNA. The highly desirable ability to introduce new predetermined genetic information at these locations using homology directed repair HDR has proven inefficient. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed an approach to enhance HDR efficiency by covalently linking the desired donor DNA to the Cas9 guide RNA complex through a fused HUH endonuclease. This effectively co localizes in both space and time the donor DNA at the site of the DSB for incorporation resulting in a 30 fold increase in HDR efficiency. HUH endonucleases cut and bind to specific DNA sequences resulting in a covalent link to the DNA via tyrosine in a rapid and stable manner. Furthermore it has been shown that in a HUH Cas9 fusion protein both proteins retain activity. This fusion complex can be introduced to a guide RNA directed to a desired genome location for editing as well as ssDNA that includes the HUH target site and the preferred donor DNA sequences. The result of this combination is a Cas9 protein targeted to a specific location tethered by HUH to the donor DNA for use in HDR. Even at low concentrations this complex results in improved HDR efficiency in multiple cell types and at multiple target loci. The availability of multiple HUH proteins with different DNA recognition sequences also opens up the possibility of simultaneously incorporating multiple targeted editing events with different donor sequences in a single cell. Other strategies have attempted to co deliver donor DNA with Cas9 machinery using either a biotin avidin bridge or a SNAP tag. However these approaches are more complicated experimentally require incorporation of expensive and non natural DNA bases or modifications and cannot incorporate many editing complexes at once. HUH Cas9 fusion proteins could facilitate progress in a variety of applications including plant editing in agriculture human therapeutics editing of stem cells and eggs and a myriad of basic research scenarios.

Generation of NK and Innate Lymphoid Cells from human stem cells, The use of human cells as therapeutics is an area of rapid expansion and has made it possible to treat diseases that have no other options available. Development of cellular therapeutics is drastically hindered by labor intensive processes required to obtain even small amounts of pure cell populations. Natural Killer NK cells have been widely identified as a promising therapeutic for a variety of cancers and viral infections including HIV but are resistant to gene manipulation and can only be obtained from a blood draw. A related cell population group 3 innate lymphoid cells ILC3s have been shown to be important for the integrity of mucosal tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract and are thought to be important in the formation and homeostasis of secondary lymphoid tissue and could facilitate immune recovery after chemotherapy or bone marrow transplants. Unfortunately the only method currently available to obtain these cells is to harvest them from surgically removed lymph nodes tonsils or from aborted fetal tissue. Despite the potential clinical application this serious limitation has effectively barred any genuine progress in fully understanding these cells and or developing them as a therapeutic. To bypass these limitations Drs. Michael Verneris Jeffrey Miller and Bruce Blazar at the University of Minnesota developed methods to create large quantities of NK cells or ILC3 cells from hematopoietic stem cells HSCs . In the case of NK cells this technology could facilitate genetic manipulation of NK cells which are inherently resistant to gene editing by introducing alterations to HSCs prior to differentiation. This includes the addition of a chimeric antigen receptor CAR that would allow re directing NK cells to tumor antigens. This technology also represents the first method to produce ILC3 cells in high numbers. This approach would not use lymph node biopsies tonsillectomies or human fetal tissue. This work will facilitate foundational clinical trials of ILC3 adoptive transfer which could serve as novel studies in areas of chemotherapy induced mucosal injury .

MHC Class II Molecules with Enhanced Co-receptor Affinity, New enhanced affinity MHCII molecules could improve current research tools for the study of CD4 T cells during cancer infections and autoimmune disease. A novel process uses directed evolution to create modified MHCII molecules with better binding affinity than their wild type counterparts for the co receptor CD4 found on T cell surfaces. Current methods for detecting and understanding specific types of T cells are imperfect. A CD4 T cell uses its unique T cell receptor TCR molecules to bind to a foreign peptide embedded in an MHCII molecule on host cells. At the same time the T cell s CD4 molecules bind to the stalk of the MHCII molecules and cooperate with the TCR to activate the T cell. Peptide MHCII tetramer based flow cytometry is a preferred method for the study of CD4 T cells specific for MHCII bound peptides from microbes cancers and autoantigens. Unfortunately peptide MHCII tetramers do not bind to CD4 molecules and therefore fail to detect CD4 T cells with low affinity TCRs. This new technology creates a new generation of modified MHCII molecules evolved to bind CD4 with stronger affinity than wild type MHCII molecules. Tetramers formed with peptide bound CD4 affinity enhanced MHCII tetramers detect T cells that are missed by peptide bound wild type MHCII tetramers. This technology allows researchers to detect more relevant T cells than currently possible. 
Rationale Design of Inhibitors based on Crystal Structures of ssDNA Bound to APOBEC, A new method will help achieve specific DNA editing events with fewer off target issues by using modified Cas9 APOBEC fusion polypeptides. Crystal structures for ssDNA bound APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B can be used for rational design of inhibitors to impede the evolvability of viruses and tumors and for development of APOBEC mediated base editing reporter AMBER systems. Better tools are needed for DNA editing in vivo. The original APOBEC1 Cas9 base editing complexes have wide editing windows which are nearly as big as the gt 20 nucleotide single stranded DNA region displaced by annealing of the guide RNA that directs the editing complex. The high resolution structural information for APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B catalytic domain enzymes in complex with relevant single stranded DNA substrates provide atomic level explanations for their strong specificity for 5 TC 3 dinucleotide sequences within longer single stranded DNA substrates. They also provide strong structural rationale that has already enabled the local specificity of these enzymes to be changed to 5 CC 3 . Structural information for these extremely efficient enzymes makes it possible to tune the enzyme to preferentially edit 5 AC 3 and 5 GC 3 dinucleotide targets. Thus these enzymes expand the DNA editing toolkit to be able to selectively target DNA cytosine bases in any dinucleotide context. In addition unlike the normal CRISPR system base editing requires neither double strand DNA cleavage nor a DNA donor template. APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B catalytic domain Cas9 base editing complexes may be targeted with an appropriate guide RNA to virtually any DNA target. They may also be used in combination with a fluorescent reporter for DNA editing i.e. the APOBEC and Cas9 mediated editing ACE reporter system . 
Engineering Human CD64 Chimeric Receptors for Immune Therapy , Recombinant immune cells are genetically modified to express a heterologous high affinity IgG Fc receptor. The IgG Fc receptor is a chimeric construct. One iteration is referred to as hCD64 16a created by cloning cDNAs of CD16a and CD64 from human peripheral blood leukocytes and fusing components of these two Fc R cDNAs to create a chimeric receptor. It consists of the extracellular region of CD64 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of CD16a. The CD64 in the extracellular domain binds with high affinity to the Fc region of IgG antibodies and the CD16a transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains then initiate potent cell signaling. The recombinant immune cells provide a sustained cytotoxic immune response against a target i.e. tumor cells in the presence of therapeutic antibodies. Moreover it is possible to attach therapeutic antibodies to cells expressing hCD64 16a prior to administering them into patients thus providing two potential clinical benefits 1 reducing the amount of therapeutic antibody normally administered to the patient and 2 directing hCD64 16a expressing cells to sites of cancer using the attached antibody as an interchangeable targeting element. Monoclonal antibodies mAbs for therapeutic purposes i.e. infectious diseases chronic diseases and cancer has become one of the fastest growing classes of drugs but their efficacy is limited by intrinsic low affinity IgG Fc receptors in patients and non responsiveness of some malignancies diseases to antibody therapies. Augmenting Fc receptor interactions with therapeutic antibodies may improve therapeutic antibody efficacy. This new hCD64 16a construct is expected to bind therapeutic mAbs with high affinity and deliver a potent intracellular signal. In addition therapeutic hematopoietic cell lines e.g. NK92 cells human induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs and embryonic stem cells ESCs can be differentiated into effector leukocytes and primary leukocytes can be engineered to express hCD64 16a to be used for cellular adoptive transfer therapy. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development In Vitro assessments completed ready for In Vivo testing 
Optimizing Gene Editing in NK Cells for Therapy and Researc, Targeted nucleases are used for the first time to optimize gene editing in primary human natural killer NK cells. The new method which boasts never before seen efficiencies includes a genome edited primary NK cell methods for editing a primary NK cell genome and methods of administering a genome edited primary NK cell. The primary NK cell may be rested or stimulated it may be a CD3 CD56 cell or a stimulated NK cell. This success of this high efficiency gene editing approach stems from optimized culture conditions electroporation protocol and using an all RNA chemically modified CRISPR Cas9 gRNA system and high quality Cas9 mRNA proteins. The genome edited primary NK cells show potential in cancer immunotherapy as the technology can be used to knock out or edit specific genes to enhance NK cells ability to expand survive and or kill cancer cells. Human natural killer NK cells are notoriously difficult to work with in culture and to date using target nucleases in primary human NK cells has not been demonstrated. NK cells are a viable alternative to using T cells for immunotherapy as they persist longer and do not face rejection issues. Furthermore NK cells do not require a CAR or other engineered receptor to find cancer cells. Biotherapeutics are currently limited by the half life of protein therapies proteins delivered to cells eventually break down in the body and must be replaced. This technology provides a longer lasting supply of necessary proteins to patients and can be customized as an anti cancer therapy to kill the patient s own cancer cells. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development In Vivo animal studies 
Microinjection for Single Cell Gene Manipulation , An auto injector injects molecules of interest e.g. dye mRNA etc. into single cells in intact tissue enabling single cell resolution with increased yield. The technology uses a 3 axis micromanipulator and a custom pressure rig controlled by user input and computer vision feedback. Incoming pressure is downregulated to a desired pressure set in the interface and delivered to a glass pipette capillary. The micromanipulator guides the pipette along a user defined line guided by the microscope camera feed and injects cells. The custom open sourced platform is readily adaptable for broad adaptation across labs. Current methods of delivering biological components into cells in tissues include viral delivery and electroporation both of which affect large populations of cells and do not allow for single cell specificity. Additionally they can only deliver several gene products at once with uncontrolled concentrations. Another method manual microinjection requires extensive training and expertise and still often results in low numbers of attempts and low yield. These limitations restrict the scope of experiments and inhibit broad uptake of the technology across labs. This new robotic platform uses microinjection to circumvent these issues by customizing injection medium and spatial selection of injected cells. The auto injector uses a micromanipulator to inject controlled solutions into cells and achieves higher yield than manual injection approximately 44 vs 15 . The resulting higher throughput enables scientists to screen molecules and genes of interest in tissue to study genetic logic of brain development and evolution. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Prototype Developed Working prototype in organotypic slices of developing mouse and human telencephalon using dye and mRNA of genes of interest showed 44 of attempts resulted in successful injections. 
Enhancing Cardiac Function Using Short Protein Inhibiting DNAs and RNAs, A new class of oligonucleotides can be used to treat cardiomyopathy. The short protein interacting DNAs and RNAs SPIDRs are designed to selectively bind to phospholamban PLN a compound that inhibits SERCA which is a necessary function for cardiac health. Results show that ssDNA and RNA interact strongly with PLN thereby inhibiting its effect on SERCA. Furthermore the length of SPIDR sequences varies and allows tunable heart function control a longer SPIDR sequence more fully restores SERCA function while shorter sequences restore SERCA function to a lesser extent. These new oligonucleotides may serve as a platform for developing effective drugs. The SERCA PLN complex is a prime target for treating heart disorders. SERCA clears Ca2 from the cytosol to initiate the diastolic relaxation phase of the heart contraction cycle. While many treatments target the contraction phase of the cardiac cycle none currently exist that target diastole. Phospholamban PLN inhibits SERCA activity by down regulating the rate of Ca2 clearance. By selectively binding to PLN this technology blocks the inhibitory effect PLN has on SERCA essentially restoring SERCA activity speeding diastole and enhancing overall heart function. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Pre clinical validation 
Cryopreservation without Dimethyl Sulfoxide, A non toxic cryopreservative solution increases the safety and viability of preserved cells for many applications such as cell therapy. The multi component cell optimized solutions contain no dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO and have shown significantly higher more than double post thaw recovery of human cells than DMSO. The solutions show promise in storing preserving and recovering induced pluripotent stem cells iPS cells and cells differentiated from iPS cells for biomedical epigenetic research and cellular therapeutic applications. Current methods for preserving human cells employ dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO which is systemically toxic and alters epigenetic characteristics of preserved cells rendering them unusable for research or therapeutic purposes. Furthermore when administered with cryopreserved cells to humans DMSO can induce such side effects as nausea chills hypotension dyspnea vomiting and even neurological toxicity renal failure and cardiovascular and respiratory complications. The DMSO free solution consists of naturally occurring non toxic components and shows a significant advantage over competing technologies. To optimize solution components and concentrations a differential evolutionary algorithm is used minimizing the amount of experimental data points necessary to converge on optimum solutions for performance. BENEFITS AND FEATURES OF DMSO FREE CELL PRESERVATION SOLUTIONs Phase of Development Proof of concept with lymphocytes and mesenchymal stem cells 
Peptide Activation of T Cells for Cancer Immunotherapy, Using peptides to recruit T cells and antibodies to tumor sites could change the landscape of cancer immunotherapy. A new technology uses antigenic peptides to stimulate the natural sensing and alarm function of resident memory T cells TRM at tumor sites in order to promote an immunostimulatory and effector environment. These activated TRM cells enhance the effect of current cancer immunotherapies by potently activating the body s innate and adaptive immune response against tumors by recruiting both chimeric antigen receptor CAR T cells and checkpoint blockade antibodies to the tumor site as well as promoting a potent local immunostimulatory environment. And because local TRM stimulation controls systemic immune system activation and recruitment these methods could likely treat a broad range of diseases. Stimulating TRM with peptides produces a safer and more effective response than conventional therapies. While checkpoint blockade antibodies can be effective in cancer treatment they can also have serious even fatal side effects. Using activated TRM cells means using fewer potentially toxic checkpoint blockade antibodies. In addition TRM activating peptides recruit CAR T cells to sites of desired efficacy.

Lysosomal Storage Disease Enzyme Delivery System, A new technology rapidly delivers therapeutic enzymes via the nasal passage to the central nervous system CNS . Such enzymes are critical for treating lysosomal storage diseases in particular Hurler syndrome. Intranasal delivery is a non invasive method able to bypass the blood brain barrier BBB to rapidly target therapeutics directly to the CNS along the olfactory and trigeminal nerve pathways. Hurler syndrome is one of the most severe versions of lysosomal storages diseases mucopolysaccharidoses or MPSs . MPS diseases occur when too many large molecules called glycosaminoglycans GAGs accumulate i.e. are stored in a cell because the patient lacks the enzymes required to break them down. When such materials accumulate in the brain a number of devastating neurological effects occur. Delivering the missing enzymes directly to the CNS may alleviate or even prevent these adverse effects by preventing the accumulation of storage materials. Existing therapies do not address CNS symptoms of MPSs because they cannot penetrate the BBB. This intranasal method not only provides a novel route of administering FDA approved therapeutic enzymes to the brain but it does so quickly in only 20 minutes enzyme activity in mice was detected throughout the brain. In addition this method could be used much earlier i.e. in neonates expanding the patient population that could benefit from treatment.

ssDNA Amphiphile Self-Assembly Forms DNA Nanotubes, Nanotube structures can be synthesized from DNA conjugated to hydrophobic molecules to form amphiphiles. Experimental data shows that these structures form spontaneously in solution are not dependent upon a specific salt concentration and remain viable even after the solvent is removed from the system. Because of the simplicity of this approach it is likely that it could confer economic benefits in a production setting. Nanostructures have the potential to solve many issues associated with drug delivery and can act as tissue engineering scaffolds sensors of biological compounds and scaffolds for bioengineering. One of the principal tools used to produce nanoscale architectures is lithography an expensive time consuming and often dangerous process that utilizes various acids and toxic chemicals. Lithography is also limited in its ability to generate 3 dimensional shapes. Self assembly is a means to generate nanoscale constructs economically however many methods are very complicated and rely on specific solution compositions and temperatures in order to function. The ssDNA single strand DNA scaffolds offer a viable alternative to lithography and other current methods. These scaffolds have potential applications in a variety of fields. In the medical sciences this could be used to cheaply and simply encapsulate and deliver drugs to specific sites such as cancer cells. In biomedical engineering nanostructures such as these could be beneficial as an element in scaffolds for tissue engineering. Nonbiological nanotechnological applications are also abundant in that this is a non lithographic method for the fabrication of nanoscale architectures. There is also precedent for nanotubes being used in applications such as chemical sensors. BENEFITS AND FEATURES OF ssDNA SCAFFOLDS Phase of Development Proof of concept 
Drug Delivery System with Precise Drug Release, A new drug delivery system has been invented that can optimize both drug retention and drug delivery within the patient. The system includes hollow gold nanoshells HGNs chemically tethered to temperature sensitive liposomes and utilizes near infrared light NIR lasers to heat the liposomes and release drug. NIR laser intensity can be controlled to increase liposome permeability in a dose dependent manner. The NIR light intensity required to reach sufficient temperatures is below that which could cause damage to human tissue such as skin or eyes . Current liposomal drug delivery methods struggle to control precise drug release at the appropriate time and rate. Without precise temporal and spatial control of drug release nearby organs and tissues can easily be damaged. This drug delivery method eliminates these issues as NIR irradiation can be applied precisely at the disease spot and at the intensity required for an appropriately timed release. NIR light also penetrates centimeters within tissue making it an optimal method to treat cancers within 1 5 cm of the body surface such as skin prostate breast head and neck. Minimally invasive procedures could be developed to provide NIR light via fiber optics to deeper organs.

Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy and Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis and Treatment, Disc shaped nanovehicles have been developed to diagnose and treat cerebral amyloid angiopathy CAA and Alzheimer s disease AD . The nanovehicles may be able to act as a diagnostic probe to help relieve symptoms caused by cerebrovascular inflammation and to promote A plaque removal in the brain. The 200nm disc shaped nanovehicles consist of a polymeric core that contains polycarbophil Technetium 99m Tc99m chitosan and cyclophosphamide. The nanovehicles diagnostic potential is due to Tc99m which is attached to chitosan and serves as a radioactive tracer for single photo emission computer tomography SPECT . This aspect could be a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic method to detect A deposits. The chitosan coating increases cellular uptake and the nanovehicles design allows them to escape phagocytic destruction. The nanovehicles are assembled through a single pot three step process with high conjugation efficiency. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer s disease affect millions of people worldwide. CAA is characterized by amyloid beta A deposits in the brain which increases the patient s risk of stroke and dementia. A plaques are also present in all AD patients. Effective treatments for either disease continue to evade researchers. Although the initial cause of A buildup is unknown targeting A plaques is a promising treatment strategy.

Mesoporous Silica-coated Iron Oxide Nanoparticle, Iron oxide nanoparticles are being widely investigated for use in a variety of biomedical applications but their potential has been limited due to their inability to maintain structural integrity under certain biological conditions. Aggregation degradation and colloidal stability are a few problems that affect the robustness of the inner core of iron oxide nanoparticles. Coating iron oxide nanoparticles in silica increases their vivo stability by minimizing aggregation protecting against degradation and allowing the nanoparticle to be further functionalized. An innovative hydrothermal treatment method for coating iron oxide nanoparticles with a mesoporous silica shell layer results in the optimal thickness of the silica layer and spacing gap between the silica shell and iron oxide core thus protecting the inner core. The silica layer is further functionalized with a polyethylene glycol PEG layer to improve colloidal stability. The structure and composition of the mesoporous silica coating is critical in maintaining the advantageous properties of the iron oxide nanoparticle core. By leveraging the favorable pore size and structural stability of the hydrothermally treated mesoporous silica coated nanoparticle researchers envision a number of potential applications for this technology including MRI imaging cancer therapies both magnetic hyperthermia as well as delivery of anti cancer drugs and or chemotherapeutic agents cell tracking drug delivery and more.

Immunosuppression Augmented by CD200 Derived Peptide, Although there have been advances in cancer research in the past few decades many cancers still lack adequate forms of treatment. In certain types of cancers this is due to the ability of tumors to produce immunosuppressive factors that prevent T cells from recognizing a threat to the body and responding. The cancer is able to escape the immune system and spread unchecked making the immune suppression capability of the tumor an important facet of tumor progression. CD200 has been found to be an immune suppresssive molecule that enhances inhibition of leukocytes in tumor microenvironments. Higher expression of CD200 has been shown to correlate to malignancies making the inhibition of such molecules a necessary area of research. In order to combat glioblastoma and similar cancers that hinder the body s ability to activate T cells the immune suppressive factors produced by the tumor must be reversed. A combination CD200 inhibitor plus adjuvant has been developed that is capable of overcoming a checkpoint blockade resulting in enhanced immune activity against the tumor. This combination therapeutic is part of a cancer vaccine aimed at improving treatment in humans and animals. This therapeutic is an exciting and revolutionary opportunity for advancement in cancer treatments. BENEFITS AND FEATURES OF CD200 INHIBITOR Phase of Development Proof of concept 
Immunotherapy for Dogs with Increased Immune Response, Recent canine cancer treatments have incorporated immunotherapy research to find a way to employ the animal s own immune system to seek out and destroy tumors. While this method can be less harmful than current cancer treatments a major hurdle to the approach is that cancer does not stimulate a strong immune response. Costimulatory proteins must activate receptors on T cells in order to trigger an immune response and tumor cells unlike viruses lack the proper costimulatory signals necessary to provoke a strong immune response. Without the canine s immune system alerted to the tumor the cancer propagates. A protein has been developed which selectively and efficiently activates T cell responses in canines. Activation of tumor specific T cells in the absence of correct costimulatory signals can lead to the inactivation of those cells in a process known as anergy . Researchers working on developing a treatment therefore provided the correct stimulatory molecules at the time of activation to avoid anergy. A panel of Fc ligand fusion proteins in combination with a tumor vaccine were screened to discover that Fc OX40L was the most potent of the stimulatory molecules. The soluble Fc ligand molecule was created to be canine specific in order to be used in preclinical animal trials. The drug which enhances anti tumor immune responses is the first of its class to be available for canines with this level of potency. This immunotherapy option offers promising treatment for animal tumors. BENEFITS AND FEATURES OF CANINE OX40L FC IMMUNOTHERAPY Phase of Development In vivo testing in canines 
Small RNA Amplification and Library Preparation, University of Minnesota researchers have developed an amplification method and library preparation process of pico quantities of RNA. This system is the first of its kind to properly amplify small quantities of RNA as a template while still producing a highly efficient library. The amplification requires only 500pg to 5ng for a template and can capture RNA of 15 nucleotides and longer. The efficiency of preparation and amplification allows for small segments of RNA from scarce cells to be appropriately analyzed along with longer RNA fragments which is an improvement over other methods which require small and long RNAs to be amplified and profiled in separate experiments. This library preparation of small RNA is the first to accomplish small RNA profiling and is more cost effective than current methods. Critical disease and cellular functions are closely linked to small RNAs such as miRNAs endo siRNAs and piRNAs. The expression of certain RNA segments has been shown to determine the health of cells and whether they are likely to express diseased qualities. Currently understanding of RNA is limited due to the scarcity of cells available to use in experimentation. Diseases in tissue often have trigger cells that directly contribute to the propagation of secondary cells and these trigger cells have RNA which is of particular use in research. However these cells are limited in number and are therefore difficult to dissect and analyze. Amplification and library preparation methods are restricted due to the limited template RNA and small RNA profiles have been unable to be produced. There is a need for RNA amplification and library preparation techniques that can be applied to pico quantities of total RNA to properly understand the role of small RNA in diseases and cell development. BENEFITS AND FEATURES SMALL RNA AMPLIFICATION AND LIBRARY PREPARATION Phase of Development Methods optimized and validated 
Nanoparticle Chemotherapy with Anticancer Prodrugs, A prodrug nanoparticle distribution technique has been developed that will aid in chemotherapy as a dispersal method of anticancer agents. Currently the nanoparticle system has been used with Paclitaxel an antitumor agent that breaks down solid tumors through permeation and toxically promotes cancerous cell death. However this system can be applied to other cancer therapeutics. Formulated in polymer based nanoparticles prodrugs can be transported to specific areas in the body through this novel method in a way that is more efficient than previous chemotherapies. Nanoparticles loaded with the prodrugs are protected from chemical reaction by the nanoparticles until they reach the reaction site making them efficient options for drug targeting. This new treatment with nanoparticle based prodrugs has higher permeation and retention of the anticancer agents into solid tumors than current chemotherapeutic treatments. Cancer treatment medications and therapies currently exist to help eliminate tumors and cancerous cells throughout the body. However the method of distribution within the patient can be a difficult task as some drugs are harmful to other cells and the proper transport and dispersal of the drug is a key factor in effectiveness. Prodrugs are medications taken to work as a chemical derivative to provide better uptake of a separate active medication. These aiding drugs can be used in conjunction with current chemotherapy treatments to increase the efficiency and safety of the medications being administered. Because proper drug administration is a high priority the search for efficient prodrugs is a key factor in cancer research. BENEFITS OF NANOPARTICLE PRODRUG THERAPY 
More Stable and Potent Cyclic ADP-Ribose Analogs, A potential method for enhancing the lifetime of bone marrow stem cells that uses cyclic ADP ribose cADPR analogs has been developed. This technology works to increase the proliferation of human hemopoietic progenitor cells more specifically to increase lymphocytes in order to enhance the efficiency of the immune system without causing cell differentiation. This technology s promotion of lymphocyte proliferation provides potential application in the treatment of cancer and other immunocompromised diseases such as AIDS. Cyclic ADP ribose has an important role in the mediation of intracellular calcium release a process that is critical in all cells. Usually cADPR behaves extracellularly to enhance the proliferation of human hemopoietic progenitors cells that give rise to other types of blood cells. This technology more efficiently mobilizes intracellular calcium compared to other currently available methods. The cyclic ADP ribose analogs are more stable to heat and enzymatic degradation than other corresponding cADPR analogs and have been found to be 50 to 100 times more potent than their parent molecules. Overall the analogs are important research tools in examining the roles of cyclic ADP ribose in cellular function and may be important in the expansion of progenitor cells populations for bone marrow transplantation and gene therapy. 
Molecular Probe Measures Nucleosides and Differentiation of ATP and ADP, A recently designed molecular probe can measure nucleosides. This high throughput screening tool of kinase drugs is a valuable diagnostic tool for measuring drug activity in energy metabolism pathways. This small lanthanide based probe binds selectively and reversibly to adenosine triphosphate ATP and adenosine diphosphate ADP with different affinities which produces a weak interaction that has an influence on the luminescence of the probe. The most important benefit is that the probe is able to detect ATP at higher concentrations closer to the intracellular concentrations of 1 10mM needed to screen inhibitors of low affinity kinases. Nucleosides play crucial roles in energy metabolism within cells. Current state of the art technologies for measuring nucleosides are often accompanied by high costs inability to measure nucleosides at physiologically relevant concentrations cumbersome reagents and require radio active labels. View the Term Sheet Contact Raj Udupa for specific details. The molecular probe is affordable non radioactive label free antibody free generic and enables the study of large proteins without being dependent on cumbersome reagents. The technology also enables time resolved or time gated luminescence detection along with the ability to measure the accumulation of ADP rather than the phosphorylation of a peptide.

Limiting Cell Apoptosis Using Ursodiol and Its Derivatives, Methods of utilizing ursodiol and its derivatives to limit cell apoptosis have been developed and can inhibit programmed cell death originating from multiple causes in various body systems. This invention discloses methods to inhibit apoptosis in autoimmune diseases cardio and cerebrovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. Ursodiol has also been shown to maintain viability thereby decreasing the need for more serious interventions. Overall the technology can assist in the treatment of various diseases and the reduction of disease symptoms. Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death in an organism. Apoptosis plays a role in many diseases and the treatments for many diseases often contributing to the disease severity or hindering the success of treatments. For example apoptosis is believed to be the cause for the symptoms associated with many liver diseases it inhibits success of neural replacement therapies for Parkinson's and it hinders recovery following ischemic stroke. A need exists for a method to prevent undesired apoptosis in humans. 
Treating Neurodegenerative Diseases with Nicotine Receptor Ligands, Nicotine receptor ligands have the potential to provide a treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer s and Parkinson s disease. The nicotine like compounds in these agonists have shown neuroprotective effects that may help to slow the progression of these neurodegenerative diseases and have some memory enhancing effects. Preliminary testing in animals has shown indications of enhanced memory as well as alleviation of chronic pain. These nicotine receptor ligands have shown to be more efficacious than morphine in pain suppression and without the detrimental side effects often seen in chronic pain treatments. View the Term Sheet Contact Raj Udupa for more information. A method to improve the efficacy of a new class of nicotine agonists that focus on regulating nicotine receptor function has been discovered. These nicotinic agonists are responsible for stimulating neurotransmitters that aid in the modulation of neuroendocrine function respiration mood motor control and function memory and cognition. This more potent class of compounds shows promise in new medications for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer s and Parkinson s disease as well as potential to help manage chronic pain. BENEFITS OF NICOTINE RECEPTOR LIGANDS 
Cancer Treatment Uses Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitor, A method to inhibit ornithine decarboxylase that is suitable for use as a pharmaceutical for the treatment of cancer has been developed. The compound has been shown to be effective at ornithine decarboxylase inhibition potentially without the hearing loss associated with eflornithine. This invention provides a method for treating cancer as well as a method for inhibiting initial cancer development. Molecules called polyamines play large roles in the growth of cancers. One specific polyamine ornithine decarboxylase has increased activities in neoplastic tissues and thus has previously been identified as target for cancer prevention. Current methods of ornithine decarboxylase inhibition involving the polyamine eflornithine have been associated with excessive toxicity resulting in hearing loss in humans. A need exists for improved methods of cancer inhibition specifically a method of ornithine decarboxylase inhibition with decreased toxicity and enhanced pharmacologic properties. BENEFITS OF METHOD TO INHIBIT ORNITHINE DECARBOXYLASE 
Cell Cryopreservation for Lymphocytes Improves Hematopietic Cell Survival , A method has been developed that utilizes cryopreservative agents for improving the survivability of hematopoietic cells when frozen. Using a balanced electrolyte solution with an arabinogalactan equivalent a high survival rate of hematopoietic cells is maintained. It contains a much smaller concentration of glycerol compared to other methods and does not use DMSO thus decreasing cell loss due to osmotic stress and DMSO toxicity. This technique will increase effectiveness of cell therapeutics by increasing cell viability following cryopreservation. Overall this cell cryopreservation method will enhance lymphocyte treatments for tumors especially following bone marrow transplants as well as treatments for viral infections.

Lymphocytes show great promise as a cell therapeutic for tumors and viral infections especially when used as an adjuvant during bone marrow transplantation. Once these cells have been modified ex vivo for the specific clinical application the cells are cryopreserved to maintain cell viability and to pool the cells to reach the dose required for clinical therapies. However current methods for cryopreservation of lymphocytes do not maintain adequate cell viability. Cell loss is seen in glycerol based methods through the creation of cellular osmotic stress and through DMSO based methods because of DMSO toxicity. A need exists for a method that decreases the cellular loss seen in current hematopoietic cell cryopreservation methods. BENEFITS OF CRYOPRESERVATION METHOD OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES 
Cancer Vaccine Adjuvant: Annexin II, Annexin II Increases MHC I Expression on Tumor Cells The protein Annexin II can work through a mechanism to boost immunotherapy treatments. Annexin II possesses attributes which makes it desirable as a cancer vaccine adjuvant it selectively increases the shuttling of exogenous antigen to the major histocompatibility complex class 1 MHC I pathway a key antigen presenting process associated with tumor killing it increases the expression of inflammatory cytokines associated with cellular immune responses and it also decreases the expression of cytokines which are known to suppress immune responses associated with tumor killing. Finally Annexin II appears to act in a synergistic manner with other vaccine adjuvants such as CpG to enhance tumor killing in breast and brain cancer models. Lack of drug efficacy and or the development of drug resistance is a common challenge in the field of oncology. There is a real need for therapeutics that can overcome these problems and make tumor cells susceptible to killing. Researchers have been investigating the use of immunotherapy for this purpose with the ultimate goal of training the patient s own immune system to seek out and destroy the cancer. One major hurdle to this approach is that cancer is viewed as self by the immune system and is very poor at stimulating a strong immune response. Vaccine adjuvants are needed which selectively potently and efficiently activate the appropriate arm of the immune system associated with tumor killing. BENEFITS OF ANNEXIN II TO BOOST IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENTS 
Treating Carcinomas Using Immunotoxin Specific for Cancer Stem Cells, Carcinomas are invasive malignant tumors of transformed epithelial cells. It has been proposed that tumor cells derive from a small population of cancer stem cells CSCs self generating progenitor cells that can migrate replicate and differentiate into mature cancer cells. CSCs appear resistant to chemotherapy drugs and radiation treatment. Although the majority of cancer cells may be destroyed with traditional treatment tumor recurrence is likely due to CSC survival. Thus therapeutic applications may benefit from targeting this cancer cell population. An immunotoxin is an antibody that is linked to a toxin. Using a mechanism unrelated to conventional chemotherapeutic agents the immunotoxin kills only cells that express the protein specific for the antibody. Thus immunotoxins can be tuned to recognize proteins restricted to certain cell types. A monoclonal antibody directed at CD133 a glycoprotein accepted as a CSC marker has been shown to arrest tumor progression in animal models of breast and head neck carcinomas. Furthermore bispecific ligand immunotoxins show greater specificity and enhancement of treatment. Combining a CSC directed immunotoxin with traditional cancer therapy may reduce tumor recurrence and improve patient outcome. BENEFITS OF TARGETING CANCER STEM CELLS WITH IMMUNOTOXIN Fulfillment Details Licensee will receive rights to practice the intellectual property patent application for the purposes of developing and manufacturing a commercial product. Phase of Development Researchers are demonstrating anti carcinoma activity in cell culture and mouse models of tumor progression. 
PEGylated Fibrin Biomatrix for Treatment of Acute Myocardial Infarction, PEGylated fibrinogen based biomatrix An improved method to deliver bone marrow derived mononuclear cells BMNC into damaged heart tissue has been developed. By injecting a polyethylene glycol polymer chain PEGylated fibrin biomatrix carrying bound hepatocyte growth factor HGF the rate of cell engraftment and cardiac function after acute myocardial infarction a heart attack has been improved. The PEGylated fibrin biomatrix acts as a patch in the area of the damaged myocyte cells. The biomatrix contains engrafted stem or progenitor cells and growth factors to increase cell survival and function at the site of infarction. This treatment is delivered through a catheter and allows for localized delivery and retention of stem cells and growth factors providing an effective minimally invasive treatment for acute myocardial infarction. View the Term Sheet Contact Kevin Anderson for specific details. Acute myocardial infarctions or heart attacks are the leading cause of death in developed countries worldwide. The prognosis after an acute myocardial infarction depends greatly on the extent of damage done to the cardiac muscle. Most heart attacks are brought on by lack of blood and subsequent death of cardiac myocytes or muscle cells creating an infarction. Current minimally invasive procedures are not able to reverse myocyte death so patients must live with compromised cardiac function or undergo invasive surgery to repair the infarction. Tissue engineering solutions such as bone marrow derived mononuclear cell BMNC transplantation methods provide the possibility of rescue or regeneration of myocardium cells lost during acute myocardial infarction. However injecting BMNCs alone has been ineffective because they do not have the matrix and growth factors necessary to promote myocyte regrowth. This PEGylated fibrin biomatrix with bound hepatocyte growth factor meets the needs of the injected cells and facilitates healing of the cardiac tissue.

"Improving photovoltaic cell efficiency by employing highly stable, earth-abundant nanoparticle system", Photon upconversion is a process in which low energy photons are converted into higher energy photons. Potential applications include solar energy harvesting as well as other applications such as photodynamic therapy thermal management and deep tissue imaging. Most state of the art photon conversion materials such as lanthanides and non linear crystals require high intensity coherent light and the alternatives such as triplet triplet annihilation have limited bandwidth of operation and are typically unable to make use of near infrared NIR spectrum. In addition materials that undergo upconversion under low intensity continuous wave excitation are extremely rare. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a plasmonic nanomaterial that shows strong upconversion with low threshold continuous wave laser illumination. This material can convert low energy photons in the near infrared region to high energy photons in the visible region under non pulsed illumination. This material ranks among the lowest threshold upconversion materials currently available and is non toxic highly stable in solution and could easily be processed to make upconverting glasses or films. In current photovoltaics about two thirds of the incident spectrum is lost low energy photons do not have enough energy to move electrons to the conduction band. Employing the process of upconversion wherein two or more low energy photons are converted to one higher energy photon can reduce these spectrum losses and increase the efficiency of solar panels. This material could be applied as coatings on top of conventional solar cells thus increasing their efficiency at very low cost. In addition as this material is non toxic and small enough to be easily endocytosed it could be used for phototherapeutic or deep tissue imaging applications using excitation in the near infrared window.

Specific kinase biosensors to probe cancer metabolism, Cancerous cells exhibit alterations to their metabolism that may contribute to proliferation survival and the development of drug resistance to commonly prescribed cancer treatments. Unfortunately the mechanisms of these metabolic changes aren t well understood limiting progress on cancer drug therapies. Laurie Parker s lab at the University of Minnesota developed four artificial cell permeable kinase substrates that serve as biosensors for serine threonine kinases LKB1 AMPK mTOR and Akt that are intimately involved in metabolism regulation. The ability to determine the activity of these critical kinases in normal cancerous and drug resistant cancer cells will help determine the metabolic activities of cells how resistance develops and provide molecular targets for therapeutic development. The kinase specific biosensors have the potential to be combined with assayable fluorophores or other signal moieties or the phosphorylation of the peptidesalone can be measured using alternate methods such as mass spectrometry. Substrates can further be selected based on their ability to permeate the membrane and their compatibility with live cells The capability of the sensors to provide real time signaling facilitates the potential to simultaneously monitor distinct kinase activities in native cellular environments. The sensors are antibody independent can be optimized for high throughput screening methods and unlike other approaches to monitoring kinase activity do not need to be genetically encoded making them ideal for development in diagnostic applications. Proof of concept. Substrate sequence motifs identified for the kinases LKB1 AMPK mTOR and Akt and preliminary substrates for LKB1 and Akt.

Kinase biosensor for individualized cancer therapy, Kinase signaling is a major mechanism driving many cancers particularly leukemias. However due to variation between cancers chemotherapeutic kinase inhibitors such as imatinib Gleevec exhibit different levels of efficacy on a patient by patient basis. With no feasible way to determine which treatment is best suited to each patient nearly 100 million dollars and precious treatment time are lost every year to ineffective therapies. To determine the best kinase inhibitor treatment strategy on an individual basis researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a multiplexed mass spectrometry assay that is capable of analyzing and comparing the specific activity of multiple kinases exposed to different therapeutics. Furthermore the analysis for all these conditions can be run in tandem saving time and money. The power of the assay to simultaneously measure a variety of kinases exposed to multiple compounds is enabled by isotope coding of kinase specific substrates. Cancer cells various inhibitors and kinase specific peptide substrates are coincubated. The substrates are isotopically distinct for each condition allowing kinase inhibitor activity to be measured and directly compared after carrying out mass spectrometry on pooled samples.This provides a robust fast and affordable method to determine if a patient will respond to a variety of different kinase inhibitor therapeutics. Furthermore since clinics already routinely use mass spectrometry for metabolite analysis this approach can immediately be implemented using existing workflows and machinery. This technology has the capability to transform kinase inhibitor treatments and serve as a model system for introducing pharmacodynamics into personalized medicine for leukemias and other cancers. Proof of concept. Individual synthetic peptides synthesised and used to assess activity at the MS1 level by mass spec analysis.

3D printed bionic skull for multimodal neural sensing , Practical technologies that enable simultaneous mapping of neuronal activities from large brain volumes at cellular resolution currently do not exist. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have conceptualized a transparent bionic skull for volumetric mapping of single cell neuronal activities of up to a 45 sq mm area in cortex of a freely moving mouse at physiologically relevant temporal resolution. The bionic skull design includes optical instrumentation for high resolution imaging and sensors to track ultra fast genetically encoded voltage indicators. TRL 2 3 Concept.

Machine learning-based sleep quality monitoring , Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed an end to end framework that uses deep neural networks to extract temporal transition structure of the sleep stages using raw flow signals. This method can be used to accurately track sleep metrics like sleep efficiency calculated from sleep stages as the response of CPAP therapy. Health care providers can monitor the patients from the convenience of the patient's home allowing for personalized proactive management of CPAP therapy which currently suffers from substantial abandonment issues. In addition automated daily reports and longitudinal tracking of a patient's response to the therapy could improve patient compliance to CPAP therapy.

Universal tyrosine kinase substrates, 20190302117 Due to their universal presence in cells the ability to measure and compare the activity of kinases is critical for basic research and to develop drugs and diagnostics for a myriad of diseases. However the variability in activity between different kinases or between batches of the same kinases has hampered the development of robust control normalization techniques. Dr. Laurie Parker s lab used their previously developed KINATEST ID platform to design and optimize a non selective universal substrate for tyrosine kinases that can serve as a normalizer for any kinase of interest. This fully characterized standardizing compound allows for more accurate comparisons of activities from reaction to reaction for other substrates or inhibitors. Currently the only identified universal tyrosine kinase substrate is the polyGlueTyr polymer which is a relatively poor substrate with slow rates of phosphorylation. The newly developed substrate is efficiently phosphorylated by all tyrosine kinases tested and compatible with high throughput screening methods. The substrate can be used as a standardizer for intrinsic activity for quality control and for normalization of kinase enzyme preparations in comparative experiments. Since the method does not require kinase modification or tagging of kinases it can further serve as a real time baseline of total tyrosine kinase activity in living cells. When combined with biosensors for specific tyrosine kinases of interest the approach facilitates monitoring specific kinase activities in their novel cellular environment over time. This technique can be applied to diagnostics and drug discovery methods that require monitoring of pharmacodynamics. In vitro testing with a variety of tyrosine kinases.

Machine learning algorithm for 3D particle field reconstruction, Researchers in Prof. Jiarong Hong s laboratory have developed an image reconstruction algorithm using a machine learning approach for accurate reconstruction of three dimensional particle fields from digital holography. Image reconstruction algorithms are used to extract useful particle information such as size and 3D position of bubbles aerosols cells etc. encoded as complex interference patterns in digital holograms. However currently available algorithms perform suboptimally at realistic conditions such as when high particle concentrations high dynamic background or cross interference noises are present. Moreover practically relevant particle field reconstruction often requires sophisticated data acquisition tedious fine tuning and is computationally intensive. Using specialized U net architecture the algorithm disclosed here has been shown to accurately reconstruct images and extract particle information with high prediction accuracy and extraction rate at significantly wider range of concentrations than previously demonstrated. Particularly instability issues and reduced localization accuracy caused due to sparsity in the particle field is tackled in this novel algorithm. The algorithm is developed using a combination of synthetic and experimental data and is optimized for quickly producing high localization accuracy smooth background and reducing ghost particles. The design of this system reduces the need to fully learn the required physics therefore reduces the training and tuning requirements for new hologram datasets and is easily adaptable in a wide range of applications. In other words this learning based algorithm is highly generalizable. Lastly this learning based hologram reconstruction is gt 30 times faster than currently available methods making it suitable for developing systems with real time reconstruction capabilities. Pilot scale demonstration in processing high density holograms.

Visualization of intracardiac electrograms on 3D heart model (VIEgram), Electrophysiologists use proprietary electroanatomic mapping systems from leading medical device manufacturers to visualize intracardiac electrograms mapped on to 3D models of the patient s heart. While these proprietary systems are highly useful for obtaining detailed electrical activities and identifying sites causing arrhythmia they suffer from drawbacks that prevent wider adoption in non clinical settings. In particular commercial systems are too expensive and are not flexible thereby impeding the development of novel data analysis techniques. In addition these systems are not ideal for in depth analysis and post treatment evaluation in clinical settings. To address this gap researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed VIEgram an adaptable software for processing analyzing and visualization of electrophysiological data on patient derived 3D heart models. VIEgram short for Visualization of Intracardiac Electrogram allows the user to readily visualize the analysis results of intracardiac electrograms obtained through conventional catheter mapping systems. As VIEgram software is built on Python for data handling and MATLAB for data processing analysis and visualization researchers have the freedom to easily modify the script to perform custom actions such as Alpha version. The software is tested using atrial fibrosis patient data exported from CARTO mapping system. This software is now available for academic license Please contact Leza Besemann to share your business needs and your licensing interests in this technology for all other purposes. 
Machine Learning-based Dynamic Activity Recommendation System, While wearables such as FitBit and other activity trackers are useful for tracking and recording user s physical and sleep activities annotation and effective interpretation of data requires expertise. Moreover evaluation of longitudinal activity data is done only in retrospect. Recently researchers at the University of Minnesota developed a data mining and machine learning approach to optimize a prediction framework that anticipates sleep quality beforehand. By evaluating a person s physical activities over time the algorithm recommends a set of activities to improve the quality of the individual's sleep. Polysomnography PSG is the gold standard for clinical sleep diagnosis and requires multiple sensors to track brain activity body movement heart rate breathing frequency and O2 levels. While PSG provides high fidelity data accuracy can be low because patients are required to sleep in the hospital missing the more accurate picture of a patient s behavior in familiar settings. Wearables on the other hand can track sleep and physical activities actigraphy around the clock in familiar settings. This recommender system was developed to evaluate actigraphy data of individuals using human activity recognition algorithms. After evaluation the algorithm can identify behavioral patterns that lead to good or poor quality sleep. These patterns are then used as target behavior to ensure a good night's sleep. This machine learning algorithm can be integrated with existing wearables to predict and recommend highly personalized behavioral changes to improve the individual s quality of sleep. This technology is now available for license The university is excited to partner with industry to see this innovation reach its potential.

iTorsion - Smartphone App for Ocular Torsion Diagnosis, A smartphone app iTorsion for diagnosis of ocular torsion by physicians. It is not intended for self diagnosis by patients. Patients wear standard red green glasses. While holding the smartphone perpendicular to the ground the patient should predominantly see one line out of each eye. The patient is asked to make the lines parallel with each other and with the ground. After finishing the test the app will report the degree of extorsion and intorsion for each of the patient s eyes. Ocular torsion affects thousands of people in the United States. Traditional diagnostic methods often require special equipment e.g. Double Maddox Rod and lack precision. The iTorsion app offers a simpler and more precise method to diagnose the problem. iTorsion requires only a smartphone and red green glasses. 
Enhanced Brain Structural Connectivity Mapping, This technology is a software based model for analyzing whole brain diffusion magnetic resonance imaging dMRI and functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data to estimate function specific brain circuits. The approach reveals detailed anatomical connectivity patterns for each functional module and recovers structural connections that are underestimated by diffusion MRI dMRI . Using Human Connectome Project HCP data the model successfully identified function specific anatomical circuits such as the language and resting state networks. Traditionally estimating brain circuits by incorporating information from functional MRI into diffusion MRI is challenging. Seed regions for tractography are selected from fMRI activation maps to extract the white matter pathways of interest. This new method jointly analyzes whole brain dMRI and fMRI data revealing detailed anatomical connectivity patterns for each functional module. This novel framework explicitly models interactions between structural and functional connectivity measures thereby improving anatomical circuit estimation. 
Clinical Quality MRI Image under Inhomogeneous Magnetic Field, This technology is a new MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging acquisition sequence implemented in software that provides clinical quality images under extremely inhomogeneous magnetic fields. The novel method employs radiofrequency RF pulse trains for signal excitation and acquires refocusing echoes generated by the RF pulse train excitations. It does not use refocusing RF pulses. This new steady state sequence uses a train of low flip angle e.g. 5 short duration e.g. tens to hundreds of microseconds pulses and a wide bandwidth for signal excitation. It is specifically designed to yield robust data in the face of extreme B0 inhomogeneity while limiting RF peak power and specific absorption rate SAR . A modified version of this MP SSFP sequence can also be used to map the three dimensional 3D distribution of B0 even when the degree of B0 inhomogeneity is extremely large. For example high quality three dimensional 3D images and B0 mapping have been demonstrated using a magnet with 200 kHz of resonance frequency variation across the object of interest. In a clinical 1.5 Tesla magnet this degree of B0 inhomogeneity corresponds to 3000 ppm. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI under highly inhomogeneous static magnetic fields faces fundamental difficulties in signal excitation and data acquisition. The conventional approach of using spin echo sequences is limited by the requirement to use short high flip angle 180 refocusing pulses which results in high SAR in subjects. This new approach introduces an MRI method under inhomogeneous magnetic fields that uses only short low flip angle RF pulses. A 3D B0 map can be measured by using phase encoding in all three spatial directions. 
Enhanced Resolution Cardiac MRI , This technology is an MRI magnetic resonance imaging pulse sequence for cardiac imaging which enables an increased number of slices across the heart volume per heart beat resulting in enhanced temporal and spatial resolution. The method may result in a decrease in overall scan time. The novel method combines outer volume suppression OVS and accelerated imaging such as simultaneous multi slice SMS compressed sensing CS without introducing fold over artifacts. Cardiac MRI is often slow and is typically limited to only three slices across the heart per heartbeat. In addition 3D high resolution cardiac imaging sequences can take up to 10 minutes. Current OVS techniques do not usually allow for a reduction of the FOV as the residual signal creates fold over artifacts. This novel method enables increased acceleration rates and reduces fold over artifacts. Combining OVS with SMS and CS accelerates scan time particularly for body imaging and improves temporal and spatial resolution. A novel imaging sequence uses the CAIPIRINHA method for multi band MB imaging to allow myocardial perfusion imaging. This method adds an outer volume suppression module to reduce signals from the chest and back while the heart is imaged. Multi band imaging may increase the coverage significantly and adding the OVS module may enable faster multi band imaging rates. 
In Vivo Measurement of ATP Hydrolysis , This technology is a new magnetic resonance spectroscopy magnetization saturation transfer MRS MST pulse sequence implemented in software that provides the ability to measure adenosine triphosphate ATP hydrolysis rate in vivo. It is a double saturation 31P MST protocol that uses inversion recovery data and spectral data to measure ATP hydrolysis rate without requiring quantification of inorganic phosphate levels. By eliminating the need to quantify inorganic phosphate Pi 31P this technology overcomes the primary barrier in determining the ATP turnover rate in vivo. The method will help basic science researchers investigate the energetic foundation of the function and dysfunction of certain organs and tissues. Clinically it may be used to grade tissue function to grade the severity of certain heart diseases e.g. myocardial infarction and evaluate stem cell treatments and other therapies with high spatial resolution. It has been speculated that decreased myocardial ATP production may contribute to cardiac dysfunction. However accurate measurements of myocardial ATP turnover rates could never be examined in vivo. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy magnetization saturation transfer MRS MST has been extensively used for more than a decade to measure the ATP flux via creatine kinase CK in myocardial tissue. However MRS MST has generally not been successful in vivo in large animal models because the products of ATP hydrolysis ADP and Pi are at levels too low to be accurately measured. This new MRS MST method can calculate the ATP hydrolysis rate in vivo in humans. It allows ATP hydrolysis rate to be measured in organ systems where inorganic phosphate levels are difficult to quantify. 
Improved MRI Signal-to-Noise Ratio with Digital Beam Forming, This technology is algorithms implemented in software on magnetic resonance imaging MRI scanners. The method is expected to increase signal to noise ratio SNR which enhances image fidelity reduces tissue heating SAR and enables image acceleration. It comprises the beam forming invention Receive only Transmit B1 shimming and Receive and Synthetic Aperture. The latter is expected to improve SNR even though computational complexity and scan time may increase.The method is expected to be compatible with most 3T clinical scanners. To improve signal to noise ratio SNR current magnetic resonance imaging MRI scanners borrow phased arrays techniques from radar. However when this approach digitizes image data it does not use certain information e.g. geometric information pertaining to the directivity of each individual MR coil element and may lose other information e.g. phase which could further improve SNR. This new software adapts the advanced radar techniques of beam forming and synthetic aperture radar to MRI improving image contrast and SNR on a voxel by voxel basis. 
Soft Tissue Elasticity Imaging Method to Assess Pathology, This invention uses ultrasound to measure the nonlinear mechanical properties of an object including those of biological tissues. This information can be used to detect abnormalities in tissues. The technique combines the advantages of using acoustic radiation force ARF ultrasound for local tissue characterization and the capability of assessing the nonlinear tissue elasticity as an additional new modality for differential cancer diagnosis. At present no techniques are capable of assessing nonlinear tissue elasticity locally via acoustic radiation force ARF ultrasound. ARF generated by modulated ultrasound is already used in a number of medical diagnostic techniques Vibroacoustography Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging SWEI Supersonic Imaging and Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging ARFI . However these techniques only diagnose the tissue locally by assessing its linear elastic parameters. Estimating a tissue s nonlinear elastic parameters may elevate the differential diagnosis of cancerous lesions. This localization is especially important when imaging highly heterogeneous tissues as it allows the user to distinguish in terms of linear and nonlinear tissue between neighboring regions with high spatial resolution. 
Improved Multi-Band Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Three new multi band MB imaging methods for MRI adaptively optimize and improve MB imaging performance and quality and increase its flexibility. These approaches can be widely applied to any MB imaging based method. Traditional MB imaging uses only one set of fixed parameters for both imaging acquisition and reconstruction a practice that limits the performance and flexibility of MB imaging. This new adaptive MB imaging AMI technology overcomes such limitations. This approach applies multiple imaging acquisition and reconstruction controlling factors based on different targeted organs and improves existing MB imaging by offering more flexibility optimal performance and improved imaging quality. 
MRI Pre-Scan Method for Imaging Metallic Devices, A new pre scan method can measure radio frequency RF induced currents flowing on metallic leads during an MRI excitation. The method first acquires low power images around a metallic lead including those used for Deep Brain Stimulation or DBS using conventional Gradient Echo Sequence GRE accelerated by parallel acquisition i.e. GRAPPA . Then it analyzes the images and quantifies the magnitude and phase of the RF induced current. To do so it uses the relative location of the B1 null with respect to the lead position in axial images. Finally it models matches the null location at the vicinity of the lead. The calculated induced current is patient and lead location specific. The measurement can be used to predict safe excitation scenarios reduce heating around the lead and may also significantly improve image quality. For patients with implanted devices MRI scans can induce radio frequency RF currents on implanted metallic leads which may critically increase the temperature at the lead tip and impact image quality. Current methods to address these issues include MR compatible lead designs and MR excitation methods that minimize risk of heating. When combined with a variety of MR sequences the method can improve the image quality and patient safety in clinical scenarios. The new method is not model based but is achieved in vivo for each particular patient and lead location. In addition it can be used to calculate worst case scenarios for lead heating and replace the need to take temperature measurements. 
Compressed Sensing Coronary MRI Sequence , A novel MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging imaging sequence and reconstruction method uses a randomly undersampled acquisition of a 3D k space to allow a compressed sensing accelerated coronary MRI sequence. Compressed sensing allows for acceleration rates higher than parallel imaging. Coronary MRI still faces major challenges including lengthy acquisition time low signal to noise ratio SNR and suboptimal spatial resolution. Higher spatial resolution in the sub millimeter sub mm range is desirable but this results in increased acquisition time and lower SNR hindering its clinical implementation. 
Localization of Cardiac Arrhythmia Origins from ECG, A new technology localizes the origins of cardiac arrhythmia via clinically available 12 lead electrocardiography ECG enhanced by convolutional neural networks CNNs and a realistic computer heart model. After registering the cardiac model with individual patient s heart training datasets are generated and the origin s of focal cardiac arrhythmias are localized. ECG data is fed into one or more CNNs one CNN classifies atrial applications two CNNs classify ventricular sources . The applicable CNN identifies the segment of the heart where the arrhythmia originated and whether it has an epicardial or endocardial focus. This novel technology can not only map premature ventricular contraction PVC in patients but may apply to other cardiac disorders e.g. ventricular tachycardia and atrial arrhythmias . It may provide real time monitoring and localization of cardiac arrhythmias origins which can be used to guide ablation treatment. Advanced imaging methods currently used for cardiac navigation i.e. for ablation to treat atrial fibrillation use algorithms to translate positioning data from a cardiac catheter into a 3D image. Pace mapping a commonly used technique for localizing an ablation site is invasive and may even damage healthy tissue. This new non invasive approach uses only 12 lead ECG making it broadly applicable without additional hardware. CNN expedites localization and achieves accuracy comparable to those requiring high density body surface mapping. 
Referenceless Nyquist Ghost Correction for Echo Planar Imaging (EPI), A novel referenceless technique corrects magnetic resonance imaging MRI images by removing Nyquist ghost artifacts from echo planar imaging EPI . The algorithm seeks to find a set of optimal phase correction parameters that minimize a metric calculated directly from uncorrected images. The metric is defined as the sum of the ratio between the image and an image shifted by half of the field of view FOV . The method is effective for not only single shot EPI but also for multi shot EPI where current methods require a reference scan navigators or user intervention. Echo planar imaging EPI used for fast imaging on magnetic resonance imaging MRI scanners is prone to an artifact known as a Nyquist ghost. While existing methods can offer Nyquist ghost correction they often fail in body imaging due to insufficient fat suppression. This technology offers a unique Nyquist ghost correction method with better performance increased robustness and reduced acquisition requirements compared to existing methods. 
3D printing on Moving Freeform Surfaces, Adaptive 3D printing is a new approach that allows 3D printing on moving freeform surfaces. The closed loop method combines direct ink writing of functional materials and real time feedback control to fabricate devices on moving surfaces. The hybrid fabrication procedure which combines conformal 3D printing of electrical connects with automatic pick and place of surface mounted electronic components printed functional devices on a free moving human hand. This adaptive 3D printing method could lead to new manufacturing technologies for directly printed wearable devices and advanced medical treatments e.g. wound healing . Current 3D printing technologies typically rely on open loop calibrate then print operation procedures and are limited to 3D printing on planar surfaces. Previous attempts to track and ink jet print on a moving human hand were limited to gesture tracking in 2D without compensation for the geometries of the hand surface. This new closed loop adaptive 3D printing technology can track arbitrary surface motions in 3D and therefore print onto moving and deformable surfaces with arbitrary geometries. This approach addresses the limitations of previous techniques by correcting in real time printing errors from both the freeform geometries and the 3D motions and deformations of the target surfaces. 
Tracking Deformation of Organs during Minimally Invasive Surgery, A new algorithm tracks exterior and interior surfaces of organs to provide a surgeon with a real time 3D view of organs as they deform. The 3 D reconstruction allows the surgeon to see through the wall of an organ during surgery rather than just look at its surface. The algorithm is based on sparse sampling of the exterior surfaces tracked by identifying subspaces in which the coefficients of spherical harmonic representations of the surfaces live. It uses pre operative CT MRI scans during training and needlescopic images acquired during tracking. Viewing live tissue deformation allows the surgeon to track the 3 D reconstructed image and guide surgical intervention. This technology will realize the promises of minimally invasive procedures e.g. NOTES single port laparoscopy biopsies etc. while effectively mitigating the risks associated with the limited field of view available to the surgeon. Existing technology cannot track 3D organs during surgery using needlescopic incisions. Procedures that minimize the size and number of incisions should reduce hospitalization time lower complication rates and ultimately reduce the morbidity and mortality from surgery. However limiting the surgeon s field of view may increase the risk of complications. This new technology provides the surgeon with a view of the organs as they deform during the surgery thereby eliminating the major drawback of single port interventions. It provides the first ever real time interior organ surface reconstruction using sparse sampling of exterior surfaces with error rate as low as 0.095 . When the algorithm was applied in 3D cardiac frame interpolation it showed an error rate of only 1.15 and reduced the radiation exposure by 90 . 
MRI of Amyloid Plaque in the Brain, A magnetic resonance imaging MRI method performs in vivo imaging of amyloid plaque in the brain with or without a contrast agent. The image is reconstructed using data acquired from a very high resolution spin echo imaging pulse sequence which achieves contrast using a respiratory gated and cardiac gated spin echo pulse sequence to reduce motion artifacts at the very high image resolution required to see plaque. A preparatory pulse sequence ensures that longitudinal magnetization remains constant for allacquired views even if the effective TR changes during the scan due to irregular breathing. The method which acquires very high resolution in vivo images uses respiratory gating. Each pulse sequence in the imageacquisition is triggered by a signal from a physiological monitor that detects a specific point in the respiratory cycle. A preparatory pulse sequence precedes each imaging pulse sequence to create uniform view to view longitudinal magnetization in the presence of non uniform view to view respiratory trigger times.

Faster Functional and Diffusion MRI of the Brain, A new technology is an innovative combination of two independent data acquisition acceleration techniques Simultaneous Image Refocusing SIR and Multiband excitation MB using multiple receiver coils. The new technology provides significantly faster functional and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the brain and works on all modern MRI scanners. SIR and MB techniques on their own are each faster than conventional methods but face limitations at higher speeds. This new combined technique multiplies data acquisition speeds while avoiding the limitations of each technique separately and can image the brain seven times faster than current techniques without sacrificing resolution. During testing echo planar imaging EPI whole brain scan time at 3 and 7 Tesla showed marked reductions in time. Furthermore the method did not sacrifice spatial resolution and even gained functional sensitivity. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Pilot scale demonstration 
3D Shoulder Motion Measurement System, The MnMotion System is an easy to use clinical tool to accurately measure diagnose and objectively track progress for shoulder movement disorders. The system consists of a physical component that attaches to a mobile device or smartphone and accurately measures shoulder positions. The handle maximizes accuracy of measurement including location of fingers relative to important bony landmarks and features an ergonomic grip to stabilize the attached phone or mobile device while taking measurements. The mobile device s sensors capture accurate three dimensional position information of the bone being measured and the patient's movement data is analyzed by a user friendly mobile app to provide targeted diagnostic information and treatment recommendations. The MnMotion System has the potential to be the new standard of care for shoulder movement diagnoses and treatment and may even be used to develop similar products for other joints resulting in a suite of simple measurement devices and associated mobile apps for diagnosis and guided treatment of musculoskeletal and neuromuscular movement disorders. Visual observation is the current clinical standard of care for assessing movement of the scapula but this practice is inadequate for a number of reasons. Imaging based systems are highly accurate for tissue pathology but they cannot assess the movement abnormalities that are the focus of rehabilitation treatments fundamental to successful patient outcomes. Clinical tools e.g. inclinometers are rarely used for shoulder motion measurement due to their difficulties and limitations.

Probes for Biosynthesis of Bacterial Cell Wall, Fluorophore conjugated beta lactone lactone chemical probes can selectively label penicillin binding proteins PBPs . The selective activity based probes for PBP labeling in S. pneumoniae use novel lactone scaffolds and uniquely feature PBP2x localization at both the septal ring and the center of the septa during division. Adding clickable groups or affinity groups such as biotin can isolate the PBPs and proteins associated with them in the cell. The probes enable imaging and visualization of specific PBPs expressed and catalytically active in bacteria by conjugation to fluorophores and through click chemistry handles. The compounds have potential for studying specific PBPs their physiological role in bacteria and their mechanisms of resistance. Advancing knowledge of the physiological role of specific PBPs may allow development of new and selective PBP inhibitors. Additionally these probes could serve as safer molecular diagnostic tools that aid in identifying resistant bacterial strains and contribute to personalized therapies. Fluorescently labeled antibiotic probes bind to PBPs along an antibiotic backbone consisting of a lactam antibiotic. The binding process allows for specific PBP labelling so researchers can visualize activity and isolate PBPs for further use i.e. studying bacterial cell wall biosynthesis gel based analysis of penicillin binding proteins and bacterial imaging applications . Studying PBP activity in cell wall synthesis also lends important insight to bacterial resistance mechanisms. PBPs targets for many antibacterial agents are involved in the synthesis and crosslinking of the peptidoglycan polymeric structures that comprise bacterial cell walls. Standard methods for detecting PBPs use probes that are radioactive and difficult to handle for large scale analysis. Furthermore current methods are insufficient in the study and characterization of individual PBPs expressed in bacteria and analysis is time consuming. This new technology generates selective activity based probes to evaluate PBP localization and activity in Streptococcus pneumoniae where the alternative lactones scaffold can generate PBP selective imaging agents for assessing PBP2x. These fluorescently labeled chemical structures can be used for gel based analysis of penicillin binding proteins and bacterial imaging applications. The primary advantage of these probes is their demonstrated ability to selectively probe for individual or groups of PBPs not currently possible with commercial PBP inhibitor fluorophore conjugates. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development In Vitro in vivo assessment. Molecules have been synthesized and tested in multiple bacterial organisms. 
Adaptive Refocusing of Ultrasound Arrays Using Synthetic Aperture Imaging Data, An adaptive image based refocusing algorithm uses synthetic aperture imaging data for safe and effective focused ultrasound in imaging and treating tissue abnormalities in complex media. The refocusing technology designed for ultrasound arrays with transmit receive capabilities is well suited for any imaging array with transmit receive capability in particular for large aperture arrays capable of operating in therapeutic and imaging modes like dual mode ultrasound arrays DMUAs . The array is capable of imaging in both synthetic aperture SA and single transmit focus STF modes and imaging provides real time feedback for quality refocusing. The algorithm can be implemented on any existing imaging system with software or hardware access to pre beamformed raw element data and contains hardware features for efficient real time adaptive refocusing as new system architecture. Ultrasound imaging arrays are increasingly being used in pulse echo imaging of complex media e.g. transcranial imaging of the brain breast large aperture trans thoracic cardiac imaging and non invasive high intensity focused ultrasound may even be used for deep brain stimulation instead of electrical stimulation via embedded electrodes . However bone causes beam distortions and defocusing a major hindrance of using focused ultrasound successfully in these applications. This new adaptive refocusing method offers imaging interspersed within energy bursts shots and combines synthetic aperture SA and single transmit focus STF echo data and performs the optimization in multiple bands in order to maximize the focusing gain. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT Preliminary animal data in rats ex vivo human skulls. The refocusing algorithm has been demonstrated in transcranial focusing in rat brain. 
Conformable Dual-mode Ultrasound Transducers for Neuromodulation, A site specific patch which attaches to the skin like an adhesive bandage offers non invasive transcranial focused ultrasound tFUS neuromodulation via dual mode ultrasound array DMUA transducers. The DMUA transducer patch features lightweight transducers with a low profile layered structure of a 3D printed lens based on the treatment target and surface topography thin polymer piezoelectric transmitting receiving elements and a thin backing material i.e. alumina or flexible circuit boards . A low power driving circuit is driven by a battery powered handheld device. The patient specific design and the 3D printed lens allow this device to target specific volume within the brain or other neural targets like DBS but without having to drill a hole in the patient s skull. Transcranial focused ultrasound tFUS neuromodulation shows promise as a noninvasive modality with a high degree of spatiotemporal control but such spatial control often requires hundreds or even thousands of transducer elements significantly limiting tFUS use to hospital settings. This patch design offers the highest level of spatial precision possible while requiring very low channel count eliminating the need for a bulky driver for hundreds of array elements. The patch can also be targeted to multiple volumes and allows for minimization of the number of elements to only a few elements as opposed to hundreds or thousands . BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development technology is ready for testing 
Nonlinear Post Beamforming Filter for Imaging , Ultrasound imaging using a dynamic nonlinear post beamforming filter e.g. based on a pth order Volterra model is capable of separating the linear and nonlinear components of image data e.g. extracting the nonlinear components of the image data . The technique is applicable but not limited to both tissue and contrast agent nonlinearity. A system identification algorithm derives the filter coefficients. The filter based approach is capable of extracting a broad band of frequencies that allow for contrast enhancement while preserving image detail. True nonlinear interaction between these frequency components is accounted for by using a pth order Volterra filter. The method for ultrasound imaging of matter in a region provides wave energy into the region where the wave energy has a pulse spectrum centered at a fundamental frequency. Wave energy returned from the region is transduced to form a set of receive signals which are beam formed to provide data representative of at least a portion of the region. The linear and nonlinear components of the beam formed data are separated based on a pth order Volterra model where p is equal to or greater than 2 . The non linear components of the beam formed data can be processed to form an image. View the Term Sheet Most conventional ultrasound scanners create 2D tissue images and while ultrasound wave energy is tissue is nonlinear harmonic imaging still receives signals from tissue limiting the specificity between contrast agent and tissue. Various improvements to ultrasound imaging for diagnostic use have been made in recent years but even these enhancements suffer from limitations. This technology offers an improvement over existing ultrasound imaging using a dynamic nonlinear post beamforming filter in order to separate linear and nonlinear components of image data.

Segmenting 3D Bone Computed Tomography Data, A two stage variational approach for segmenting 3D bone computed tomography CT data performs robustly with respect to thin cartilage interfaces. The method uses fracture mechanics in the second stage to remove fine scale contact bridges that connect object contours generated in the first stage. This approach eliminates spurious contacts between individual segmentation regions based on the transfer of the phase field fracture approach to segmentation and the seamless integration of fracture mechanics principles with existing variational segmentation methods. The process segments objects e.g. bone objects from surrounding tissues in a medical image e.g. those obtained with CT or other x ray imaging . Existing segmentation methods suffer from low quality image resolution and or fuzzy color information limiting their ability to identify individual objects and their segmentation region in the presence of thin cartilage interfaces. Competitive approaches are developed for a particular bone and therefore lack generalization to other bones. This new method is general and robust and can easily be adjusted to any bone extraction situation. In addition its variational framework can be easily combined with downstream patient specific bone strength simulations. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Prototype dev 
Time Efficient Arterial Spin Labeling Imaging with Segmented Multiband-acquisition, Multi band echo planar imaging MB EPI a new approach to increase data acquisition efficiency and or temporal resolution can potentially overcome critical limitations of standard acquisition strategies for obtaining high resolution whole brain perfusion imaging using arterial spin labeling. While multiband may also introduce certain confounding effects recent studies reveal that the amplified noise given by the geometry factor or g factor and the leakage contamination assessed by the total leakage factor have minimal impact on cerebral blood flow estimation. The studies demonstrated that compared to SB EPI MB EPI improves high resolution whole brain pCASL perfusion imaging in terms of improved spatial and temporal signal to noise ratio efficiency. Furthermore it increases compliance with commonly used single blood compartment models resulting in improved cerebral blood flow estimates. This MB EPI arterial spin labeling imaging acquisition strategy overcomes limitations of traditional MB EPI for pCASL and further improves SNR efficiencies of MB EPI arterial spin labeling imaging. Compared to single MB EPI acquisition for whole brain imaging this approach can provide extra benefits for arterial spin labeling imaging by The most significant difference is that segmented MB readouts will be applied for arterial spin labeling imaging for the inferior middle and superior brain regions instead of a single MB readout.

Mapping Prostate Cancer from Multi-parametric MRI with Improved Predictive Models, A computer aided diagnostic CAD tool based on a novel predictive model for cancer detection from quantitative multiparametric MRI mpMRI data uses magnetic resonance images to identify key markers of prostate cancer to aid in diagnosing and monitoring prostate cancer. The method validated on histological prostate cancer tissue requires the implementation of a multi parametric MRI study consisting of multiple echo time fast spin echo acquisitions dynamic contrast enhanced MRI diffusion weighted imaging at multiple diffusion weightings b values and gradient echo acquisitions at different flip angles. The software automatically processes datasets into a composite biomarker that detects cancerous tissue on a voxel wise basis and generates pixel wise maps of disease likelihood using quantitative measures to The current gold standard for prostate cancer screening the prostate specific antigen PSA test results in many false positives and false negatives and is unable to localize possible tumors or give information on the seriousness of the illness. Current standard for evaluating mpMRI data by way of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System are largely subjective using qualitative measures for disease identification and monitoring and other current diagnostic tests i.e. digital rectal exams DRE and trans rectal ultrasound TRUS guided biopsy do not provide the information needed to confidently diagnose and manage prostate cancer in an optimized cost effective way. These limitations result in high numbers of unnecessary untargeted painful biopsies e.g. random cores from partitioned sections and grading based on cores that may not strongly indicate aggressiveness of tumors. This new mpMRI technology overcomes these limitations by way of a unique database of in vivo MRI and correlative pathology and predictive models composite biomarkers for disease detection grading and eventually for assessing aggressiveness on a voxel by voxel basis. Essentially it offers improved models for imaging radiogenomics i.e. the correlation between cancer imaging features and gene expression that will improve or change the prostate cancer patient workflow. For example the process could introduce MR imaging prior to biopsy for detection grading and or guidance for biopsy reduce overtreatment and improve targeting of therapy e.g. brachytherapy external beam radiotherapy etc. . Advantages over current approaches include improved performance in terms of overtreatment and under staging potential for improved detection grading and therapy guidance which may improve patient outcome and reduce healthcare costs and voxel by voxel quantitative assessment without user intervention.

Ultrasound System for Characterization and Image-guided Therapy of Blood Vessel Diseases, A dual mode ultrasound array system provides real time 2D 3D displacement and strain imaging in the vicinity of a vessel to identify and localize the vessel walls. The system uses a real time monitoring and feedback image control of the therapy based on imaging data acquired using the dual mode ultrasound array DMUA of transducer elements and adaptive real time refocusing improves imaging and therapy by using array directivity vectors obtained from DMUA pulse echo data. The technique provides simultaneous imaging of the vector flow field and the wall tissue motion and the corresponding strains at high spatial and temporal sampling which may provide an essential tool in modeling fluid solid interactions between the blood and blood vessel. The DMUA imaging capability is sufficient for target identification and treatment and the high resolution imaging removes the shooting in the dark element from image guided HIFU procedures when targeting vascular structures. Most relevant ultrasound work on vascular imaging relies on grayscale data and uses normal frame rates. By using 2D 3D speckle tracking with specialized imaging modes for identification of the vessel boundaries this new approach improves the localization of the vessel wall and constructs its boundaries making it easier to identify plaques and other abnormalities. The method images displacement and strain fields in the vicinity of flow channels and shows that at sufficiently high frame rates speckle tracking methods produce well behaved displacement estimates of both the tissue motion and flow in the channel. No existing focused ultrasound devices employ vessel wall and flow imaging in the planning and execution of thermal and nonthermal treatment of target vessels. Current treatment probes lack the special characteristics this technology offers such as an applicator that not only measures wall motion and flow using speckle tracking but can measure flow directly within the vessel using vector Doppler methods exactly at or in the vicinity of the treatment site. This technology offers real time non invasive imaging of vessel wall dynamics and blood flow that provides important information that may help plan assess or predict outcomes of treatment. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development In vivo results obtained from carotid artery imaging in a healthy volunteer. 
Multi-band SWIFT Improves MRI, Multi band SWIFT MB SWIFT is a magnetic resonance pulse sequence that produces better diagnostic images by significantly increasing excitation and acquisition bandwidths which reduces blurring increases signal to noise ratio SNR for fast relaxing spins and allows imaging even without comprehensive shimming of the static magnetic field B0. This method is the first in the class of ultra short or zero TE sequences to use a multiband excitation for imaging. The MB SWIFT technology can image all types of human tissues including cortical bone or dental tissues that are problematic in current scanners and will be advantageous in musculoskeletal and maxillofacial imaging particularly near implants. It is also expected to be useful for lung imaging as well as in iron nanoparticle based imaging and MR PET combination scanners where accurate determination of bone location is critical. It also has the potential to look at other nuclei such as phosphorus to directly measure bone mineral density and could replace dual energy X ray absorptiometry. In addition using high bandwidths allows shortened time for acquisition of 3D images which is beneficial for fast diagnostics or functional imaging types of study. Some of existing ultra short or zero TE sequences can reach a high RF efficiency but are limited by effective excitation bandwidth. Others can use high excitation bandwidth but only at the cost of RF efficiency which results in limited flip angles and less than optimal SNR. MB SWIFT technology offers the flexibility to add a required number of pulse elements to excite extremely high bandwidth at still optimal flip angles. This advancement can be especially useful for MRI scans that necessitate the use of big and inefficient body or other RF coils. SWIFT SWeep Imaging with Fourier Transformation MRI is a quiet imaging technique that can image a wide variety of tissue types including bone. However limited bandwidth inherent in all imaging decreases transmit power efficiency and sensitivity in ultrashort TE imaging. And it reduces the amount of information about fast and slow relaxing spins in a single scan. As a result SWIFT suffers from decreased signal to noise ratio SNR increased specific absorption rate SAR and increased off resonance blurriness. Similarly current silent imaging sequences suffer from low SNR and blurring. This MB SWIFT technology is a next generation of gapped SWIFT pulse sequence in which multiband sideband excitation dramatically increases bandwidth with reduced RF power resulting in reduced SAR and increased SNR. In addition it is easier to implement this version of SWIFT on current scanners since pixels are based on the number of sidebands rather than number of gaps. Its improved diagnostic capabilities due to increased image fidelity allow expansion of MR into areas of the body that are less conducive to MR imaging and for anatomical regions currently visualized well by conventional MRI methods MB SWIFT can add silence and increased speed.

Human Whole-Body Imaging at 7T, A progressive series of five new coils make practical human cardiac magnetic resonance imaging MRI and spectroscopy MRS possible for the first time at 7T. MRI and MRS at 7T have great potential as tools for imaging and spectroscopic detection of cardiovascular diseases yet there are currently no means available for practical 7T cardiac MRI and MRS. This new technology solves this problem by applying MR techniques to the heart. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Proof of Concept 
Intraoral Dental MRI Coil, An intraoral radiofrequency RF loop coil placed between the teeth efficiently images teeth and associated dental structures. The coil is oriented with its axis parallel coaxial with the Zeeman field coil plane perpendicular to B0 and captures B1 information using the coil s transverse sensitivity volume. This orientation provides one of the most appropriate fields of view FOV for orofacial applications i.e. it sees the necessary structures but does not see adjacent and therefore non relevant anatomy . This orientation appears the most ideal for obtaining MR images for dental applications as the sensitivity volume includes the most important dental structures e.g. teeth jaw while mostly excluding cheeks lips and spinal cord. Traditional dental image techniques e.g. bite wings cone beam CT CBCT and Panorex use ionizing radiation and have been linked to brain tumors and cataracts. Moreover these imaging modalities cannot simultaneously image hard e.g. dentin bone and soft tissues nerves inflammation fat have limited sensitivity to detect small anomalies in teeth e.g. early caries cavities cracks root fractures and cannot be using in continuous fashion to obtain functional imaging e.g. TMJ movement blood flow in teeth . Using an extraoral coil for dental MRI is hindered by high signal from the cheek and the larger field of view reduces the resolution that is obtainable. Using an intraoral coil for dental MRI that is place beside the teeth is uncomfortable for the patient does not image the apices tips of the teeth and only obtains images of 3 4 teeth at a time. This new intraoral MRI coil design solves these problems with a coil configuration that maximizes patient comfort provides full coverage of the complete dental region and largely excludes signal from unwanted tissues. This new approach uses a highly advantageous configuration that limits the field of view limited to a small region above and below the coil and allows the total scanning time to be reduced while maintaining high resolution.

MRI Coil Amplifiers, A magnetic resonance imaging MRI method and apparatus amplifies radio frequency RF signals from MRI coils. The coils containing antenna elements are power amplified by a distributed power amplifier with electronic devices e.g. field effect transistors . The approach locates an MRI coil with antenna elements within an MR magnet and amplifies its RF signal to obtain high power RF pulses. These amplified pulses are then thermally and or mechanically coupled to their respective antenna elements to form a hybrid coil amplifier for MRI or spectroscopy machines. The amplification can be performed remotely as can adjustments of the gains electrical resistances inductances and or capacitances that control the magnitude phase frequency spatial profile and temporal profile of the RF signal. The components of this technology are compatible with function in high magnetic fields up to and exceeding one tesla or even ten tesla or more and or an electric field of many thousands of volts per meter . BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Prototype development 
Simultaneous RF Transmit and Receive in MRI Coils , A magnetic resonance imaging MRI method and apparatus can receive radio frequency RF signals while simultaneously transmitting a signal of like frequency. The MRI and spectroscopy technology removes artifacts of the transmitted excitation signal Tx from the received signal Rx leaving only the desired net received signal NRx to generate an image from the MR response if the person or object being measured. Its components are compatible with and function in high fields such as a magnetic field of one tesla or more or even ten tesla or more and or an electric field of many thousands of volts per meter . In conventional MRI MRS machines the excitation RF signal is a pulsed RF signal transmitted before and not overlapped with the receive signal. The received RF signal of interest is extremely small compared to the transmit signal and the receive pre amplifiers preamps would be overloaded or damaged if coupled to the receive antenna simultaneously with the excitation RF pulse being transmitted. This technology allows RF signals to be transmitted and received simultaneously. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Prototype development 
MRI and Spectroscopy Multi-part Body Coil, A multi part body coil apparatus can transmit Tx and or receive Rx radiofrequency RF signals suitable for magnetic resonance imaging MRI and or magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS . The coil is configured as either a circularly polarized transverse electric magnetic TEM coil or a birdcage coil and is easily assembled disassembled e.g. for easier maintenance testing tuning and or shipping and reassembled. The apparatus consists of one or more body coil portions each having a frame with a concave inner face and a convex outer face at least one RF coil element mounted to the frame a tune and match circuit operatively coupled to the RF coil element a shield with partially overlapped staggered conductors on opposite faces of a dielectric substrate wherein the shield is coupled to the convex outer face of the frame a mechanism to align each body coil portion to neighboring portions and an interconnection circuit configured to transmit to and or receive from the RF coil elements. Preamplifiers Tx Rx switches and power amplifiers may be built into each of the body coil portions. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Prototype development 
Electrical Auto-tuning for Ultra-High-Field MRI RF Coils, A new method automatically adjusts electrical performance of radiofrequency RF coil assemblies of magnetic resonance imaging MRI systems during the medical imaging process of a subject in order to control changes in loading conditions of the RF coil caused by the subject during the imaging process. Automatically tuning the RF coil circuits provides real time tuning that electrically maintains impedance matching conditions under various human anatomies. The method first measures a reflected signal of the RF coil determines an adjusted tuned or detuned condition and then adjusts matching capacitor array banks. The technology employs a fast tuning and matching procedure and offers robust performance regardless of differing anatomy types and a simple structure that can be integrated a small board or semiconductor chip. When a human subject is placed in an MRI scanner a body loading effect degrades image fidelity by shifting the Larmor frequency and reducing the quality factor Q . In current high field 3T clinical scanners this effect can be largely ignored but as emerging parallel transmit techniques become more prevalent at 3T and the industry moves to higher field strength systems gt 3T it must be addressed. In current pre clinical multi channel parallel transmit systems and UHF MRI systems gt 3T the manual tuning step to adjust for loading adds several minutes to the imaging procedure and requires skilled technician intervention both of which are expected to hinder clinical adoption of gt 3T MRI scanners and multichannel parallel transmit systems. With this new method in only seconds each RF coil element in the auto tuned circuit can be electrically tuned without technician intervention. A control circuit adaptively determines the optimal tuning conditions and electrically tunes the system. This new approach offers improved image fidelity which enables more accurate diagnosis and clinical diagnostics not previously possible and will likely be required for market acceptance of clinical 7T scanners and emerging full multi channel parallel transmit systems. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Prototype dev 
Beam Steering Resonance along a Spatiotemporal Trajectory for MRI, A new magnetic resonance imaging MRI approach uses a spatiotemporally encoded MRI pulse sequence e.g. SWIRLY and or STEREO in combination with a smart adaptive or phased RF transmit front end. Combining these two components allows highly spatially localized regions of uniform excitation even in the presence of B0 and B1 inhomogeneities. The transmit front end is comprised of a multichannel transmit array and multiple RF power amplifiers each amplifier has dynamic phase and gain control over the output waveform. In addition by exciting only a small region at any given time and allowing more freedom to optimize selected parameters the technology is expected to reduce specific absorption rate SAR . Beam forming techniques e.g. B1 shimming or Transmit SENSE while previously shown in MRI use a static B1 shim or are based on k space Fourier formalisms. In certain applications these techniques are not optimal because they cannot avoid exciting signal outside the region of interest. Spatiotemporal imaging methods like STEREO also known as SWIRLY can achieve spatially selective excitation while simultaneously compensating for B1 and B0 inhomogeneities. When combined with an RF front end that dynamically shims the RF B1 field and dynamically changes the B1 shim throughout the pulse sequence these spatiotemporally encoded MRI methods can further avoid destructive interference patterns typically seen in imaging sequences at ultrahigh field strengths. And as field strength continues to increase current B1 shimming techniques for homogeneous transmit pattern will fail in the body possibly even the head because of the reduced wavelengths in the body whereas this method will actually benefit from this better defined basis set.

Simultaneous RF Signal Transmission and Reception in MRI  , A new technology allows first ever in vivo magnetic resonance MR imaging with simultaneous transmit and receive STAR . The process employs a feedback system with real time load compensation that enables in vivo simultaneous transmit receive Tx Rx images. The RF front end and coil subsystem maintains high isolation over variable loading conditions. Phase and gain adjustments facilitating per experiment load centering of this isolation demonstrated safe and successful human head imaging in vivo in a 4T MRI system. The load insensitive design uses a feedback system to compensate load shifts during MR experiments. Fast decaying spin to spin imaging means there is no delay between Tx and Rx so it can measure any signal regardless of decay time. Ultra low RF peak power uses a continuous wave CW mode which transmits and receives RF signals at the same time. Significantly only 50 mW peak power over a 10 minute image acquisition was used. The use of ultra low RF peak power offers great potential for the future development of a compact low cost and safe MRI scanner. MR imaging based on simultaneous excitation and reception has great potential but has suffered from significant sensitivity to load e.g. motion respiration swallowing etc. . Until now live in vivo simultaneous Tx Rx transmit and receive experiments were not possible. Current MRI scanners transmit an RF pulse wait a short period dead time and then receive a very small decaying signal. This new technology features a feedback circuit implemented in hardware that cancels leakage signals thus providing isolation between transmit and receive and allowing both to occur simultaneously. In addition this new approach offers significant reductions in peak power and power deposition specific absorption rate or SAR as well as an increased ability to image fast decaying signals for greater diagnostic capabilities.

Cancer preventative for at risk individuals, PCT US2019 024682 Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and with solid tumors occurring most commonly e.g. lung breast prostate and colorectal cancers . Due to high variability of the cancers and patients treatments are often complex and not uniformly effective. As an alternative to treatment researchers at the University of Minnesota developed an approach to prevent cancer through inhibiting the transcription factor STAT3 which is activated in a high percentage of solid tumors. STAT3 blockers could be introduced to individuals predisposed to cancer due to family history previous occurence of cancer genetic conditions etc or those that are exposed to carcinogenic factors asbestos tobacco smoke chemotherapeutics radiation etc . Although STAT3 has been implicated in cancer incidence for some time attempts to use STAT3 blockers to treat existing cancer have unfortunately been unsuccessful. The lab of Dr.Jill Siegfried found that preventative administration of a STAT3 blocker following tobacco carcinogen exposure reduced the occurrence of lung carcinomas by over 80 in a mouse model of disease. While many STAT3 blockers tested have shown low biological activity in patients and high toxicity Siegfried narrowed in on an oligonucleotide based molecule that shows no detectable toxicity after repeat dosing in mice even when immunocompromised is highly active and prevents lung cancer formation at relatively low doses. Expanding on these findings has the potential to yield a chemopreventive agent for patients at elevated risk for development of STAT3 associated cancers.

Active Knit Compression Garment Portfolio, A new process creates uniquely functional active textiles using multi material 3D printing combined with traditional textile equipment e.g. circular knitting machine . The process involves 3D printing novel yarn like filaments with strategically varying properties elasticity stiffness conductivity activation surface properties etc. that can later be formed into a textile garment. This functional compression garment clothing activates upon touching the body and self fits to the body without a power source. The SMA activated compression garment is passive and loose fitting when cool i.e. ambient room temperatures or even freezing temperatures and activates to apply pressure on the body as it warms to skin temperature. This approach enables new dynamic wearable compression garments with controllable activation and low effort donning and doffing. This SMA compression garment provides dynamic compression for therapeutic relief. The garment features nickel titanium NiTi alloy SMA spring actuators that contract with heat to provide compressive force when electrical power is applied. A novel tension limiting switch gives patients independent control of compression by applying electrical power to SMA actuators to provide compressive force. The tension switch can also prevent patients from applying an incorrect amount of power and or overheating the SMA springs. The unique feedback mechanism of the tension switch consumes no electrical power it instead uses the mechanical properties of its material. This technology uses SMA knitted actuators in a novel way to create self fitting on body clothing and wearables. The technology leverages large and controllable displacements and variable stiffness qualities to make textiles that are compliant and flexible in their inactive state and become stiffer in their active state. SMA textiles are temperature sensitive and could actuate using the body s thermal energy or other forms of heating. This textile could be used in conjunction with high force SMA textiles in a single garment to provide the necessary fitting for appropriate force output. This material could be used in place of commonly used fasteners fitting mechanisms such as lacing hook and loop tape ratcheting systems hooks and eyes zippers and snaps.

Assay to measure intrinsic efficiency of GPCR ligands, 62 594 356 G protein coupled receptors GPCRs are a prominent pharmacological target for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases and disorders. Exemplifying the success of this approach more than 30 of FDA approved drugs target at least one GPCR and worldwide more than 25 of drug sales come from GPCR modulating compounds. However with more than 800 different types of human GPCRs that function in a cell type and tissue dependent manner a straightforward method to measure the efficacy of ligands on specific GPCRs is not currently available. A new technology developed at the University of Minnesota introduces a precise method to measure the intrinsic efficacy of GPCR ligands. This approach employs systematic protein affinity strength modulation SPASM a modular assay to analyze the interaction between two peptides using fluorescence energy transfer FRET . Current methods of measuring GPCR ligand efficacy using live cells or crude preparations are complicated by the heterogeneity inherent in different cell or membrane batches. In addition assays that utilize purified GPCRs require time and resource intensive optimization for each GPCR. The new approach from the lab of Dr.Sivaraj Sivaramakrishnan uses a FRET based biosensor that detects the ligand induced interaction between a GPR and the G subunit of a G protein in live cells. This biosensor is paired with giant plasma membrane vesicles GPMVs which provides a stable relevant environment for the GPCR studies without the complexity of the intracellular environment. Not only does this method allow for adaptability between different GPCRs but is also scalable for high throughput drug screening and analysis making research on these drug targets easier to advance. TRL 3 4 Using the biosensor the direct correlation between ligand induced changes in FRET intensity and previously reported intrinsic efficacy has been demonstrated R2 0.99 .

Elderly Mortality After Trauma (EMAT) score , Elderly trauma patients are at high risk of mortality even when presenting with minor injuries. Providing proper medical care is especially challenging as these patients are medically complex and generate many ethical financial and moral questions. To support clinical decision making mortality risk score models such as the Geriartric Trauma Outcome GTO score can be used to predict mortality risk in severely injured elderly patients. However the GTO score relies heavily on the injury severity score ISS which is retrospective anatomically based and fails to account for physiologic status and comorbidities. In addition to applying equal weightage for head injuries and extremity injuries the GTO score depends heavily on whether the patient has received packed red blood cells in the last 24 hours or not. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed and validated a novel prognostic scoring model called Elderly Mortality After Trauma EMAT that can be used to quickly and accurately calculate in hospital mortality risk in elderly trauma patients at admission. Using a combination of factors including the patient s comorbidities physiologic parameters nature and severity of injury and demographic information the EMAT score has been shown to accurately estimate mortality risk. EMAT consists of a two tiered scoring model The EMAT risk scoring model was developed using a dataset containing gt 840 000 patients and is validated using a dataset containing gt 400 000 patients. Both datasets were obtained from the National Trauma Data Bank with no overlap. App is available for download on the Apple Store iPhone or iPad . The EMAT risk scoring model is currently available for download in the Apple App Store. The University is also accepting requests for integrated use of the model in electronic health records EHR .

Unique small molecule modulators of GPCRs, Application 16 428 343 G protein coupled receptors GPCRs are a prominent pharmacological target for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases and disorders. Exemplifying the success of this approach more than 30 of FDA approved drugs target at least one GPCR and worldwide more than 25 of drug sales come from GPCR modulating compounds. To expand this promising this pharmacological space Dr. Joseph Topczewski developed structurally novel small molecules that act as GPCR modulators with either agonist or antagonistic effects. Furthermore some of these compounds target Sigma 1 a recently identified target for COVID 19 therapies. The new molecules are small rigid derivatives of phenethylamine a structural motif that is part of several natural GPCR ligands including dopamine and epinephrine as well as morphine and pseudoephedrine. The GPCR binding affinity of these compounds was assessed through the Psychoactive Drug Screening Program National Institute of Mental Health . In vitro testing has revealed one of the compounds to have negligible cytotoxicity and to be capable of inhibiting oxidative stress in cultured mammalian cells. These compounds have the potential to be developed for use in a wide variety of indications including COVID 19 migraines heart disease alcohol abuse pain management psychoses depression asthma and retinal degradation. In vitro assessment of compounds has revealed low nanomolar binding affinities of the compounds to select GPCRs and minimal toxicity to mammalian cells in culture.

Fluorescence-based assay for probing lipid transfer activity, Lipid composition of cell membranes plays an important role in determining the permeability interaction with biomolecules and stability of the membrane. Lipid composition is therefore tightly regulated by a number of factors including lipid transfer proteins and interaction with lipid particles. Quantitative understanding of lipid transfer from one biomembrane to another has significant implications in discerning complex biophysical behavior of proteins and other biomolecules. Changes in the expression of certain lipid transfer proteins can also trigger biomedical related events such as inflammation and programmed cell death processes e.g. autophagy and necroptosis . Researchers at the University of Minnesota have created a new assay to quantify lipid transfer activity using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET based approach with bicelles. This technology can be used to determine if a protein of interest facilitates lipid transfer between membranes accurately determine the rate of lipid transfer and identify and evaluate drug candidates that can modulate lipid transfer activity. This bicelle based assay offers several advantages over liposome based approach by providing higher stability and enabling high throughput screening. Bicelles exhibit enhanced shelf life such as stability during refrigeration and avoidance of freeze thaw changes that plague lipid vesicles. In addition the small size of bicelles results in minimal light scattering artifacts increasing the reliability and reproducibility of FRET measurements. Lastly this assay can be used to study lipid transfer between donor bicelles and a variety of acceptor model membranes such as bicelles liposomes and micelles . The stability of this technology enables it to be the basis for a commercial benchtop kit that will allow researchers to investigate lipid transfer activity without needing to acquire expertise in lipid techniques.

Novel anticancer compound that targets metabolic plasticity, Application No. 62 924 032 Cancer cells are resilient because they rewire their metabolism to promote cell proliferation survival tumour growth and long term maintenance. Solid tumors exhibit metabolic plasticity that allows them to produce energy from either glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation or both. This necessitates that effective therapies must target and inhibit both pathways. There is abundant interest in developing small molecules that selectively target these two aberrant metabolic pathways. The search for dual activity molecules has been impaired by the toxicity of many agents targeting mitochondrial function resulting in a therapeutic window that is too restrictive. To overcome these challenges researchers at the University of Minnesota designed a molecule F MD 1 and its derivatives that exhibits potency in inhibiting glycolysis and mitochondrial function with a large therapeutic window. F MD 1 works through inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 4 and the mitochondrial pyruvate carriers MPC1 2 involved in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. This dual inhibition mechanism is necessary for the elimination of cancer as opposed to only tumor reduction. The chemical structure includes a lipophilic cyanocinnamate template designed to create a potent but reversible inhibition mechanism. This reversibility makes the molecule generally well tolerated when administered systemically a drastic improvement on the current toxic compounds that target mitochondrial function. Using various cancer cell lines F MD 1 effectively inhibits mitochondrial function and ATP production as well as the glycolytic capacity of cells. The compound also exhibits improved kinetics and stability compared to its predecessors. These properties lend F MN D1 to development as a new anticancer agent that targets tumor metabolic plasticity that is common in many solid tumors.

A synergistic therapy for multi-drug resistant cancers, Application no. 62 868 628 Many current and future anticancer drugs have difficulty entering cancer cells either due to physical properties or the action of membrane efflux pumps that actively remove drugs from the cells. Synthetic polymers are used extensively to improve the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs. However many such polymers require complex chemistry to conjugate or encapsulate drugs and can be inefficient at releasing the drugs after entering cells. Chun Wang s lab at the University of Minnesota engineered an elegant solution to these limitations combining synthetic mebranolytic polymer and chemotherapeutic drugs without the need to physically link the two components facilitating easy formulation and delivery of effective cancer treatments. Dr. Wang s lab has developed a synthetic membranolytic polymer poly 6 amino 1 hexyl methacrylate PAHM that enhances the permeability of cancer cells to anticancer drugs. In vitro tests and mouse models of solid tumors have shown that use of PAHM in combination with typical chemotherapeutic drugs like doxorubicin results in synergistic killing of cancer cells. This synergy facilitates massive reduction in the amount of chemotherapeutic drug required which would likely minimize associated side effects when translated to humans. The polymer s ability to work with a variety of existing compounds indicates that this approach is applicable to enhance treatments to a wide variety of solid tumors including those that are drug resistant. In vitro tests indicate synergistic cytotoxicity of PAHM with chemotherapeutic drugs to multiple types of cancer cell lines. In vivo tumor models indicate the approach greatly reduces or eliminates tumor growth. This technology is now available for

Portable aerosol hood to reduce spread of pathogens during medical procedures, Healthcare personnel who perform aerosol generating medical procedures such as endotracheal intubation amp extubation are at acute risk of exposure to pathogens such as SARS CoV 2. In addition 20 30 minute mandatory waiting period between two patients significantly delays procedures and adds to the cost. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have designed a portable isolation system for facilitating safe delivery of respiratory treatments to patients with highly infectious diseases. This system includes a transparent isolation box consisting of glove ports a suction port fitted with HEPA filter to create negative pressure and a partial open front through which the patient's upper body and medical equipment are introduced. The negative pressure created within the box is shown to ensure air flow can only exit through the HEPA filter collecting infectious aerosolized particles and droplets while leaving the air outside free of viral particles. This isolation system has been demonstrated in hospitals to be suitable for performing aerosol generating procedures. Designed by anesthesiologists and engineers this isolation system represents a realistic cost effective approach to rapidly build protection equipment for healthcare providers in direct contact with patients with infectious respiratory pathogens.

Novel inhibitors of HINT1 to treat neuropathic pain and addiction, Traditional opiate based pain therapeutics are linked to opioid use disorders thus necessitating the development of novel non additive alternatives. One potential target for such new compounds is the human Histidine Triad Nucleotide Binding Protein 1 hHint1 . hHint1 is involved in the regulation of a broad range of CNS functions including opioid signaling tolerance neuropathic pain and nicotine dependence. These roles along with its widespread expression in the brain have led hHint1 to be of high interest for research and therapeutic targeting. Given hHINT1 s role in modulating tolerance to opioids it is a viable non opioid receptor target for the next generation of pain medications. Researchers at the University of Minnesota rationally designed and synthesized hHint inhibitors that bind the protein with submicromolar affinities. These unique small molecules could be used to further determine the role of Hint1 in the CNS or developed into therapeutics for indications for which there are limited options. Previous work using the hHint inhibitor Tryptamine Guanosine carbamate TrpGc has shown that hHint1 inhibition is a successful strategy to enhance the pain relieving effects of morphine while preventing tolerance. However TrpGc exhibits low solubility which limits the applications it can be used in. The newly developed inhibitors are nucleoside analogs containing acyl sulfamate or acyl sulfimide that show increased solubility as well as binding to hHint1 up to 16 times higher affinity than TrpGc. These favorable properties facilitate the use of these compounds in a variety of applications and formulations as well as in the treatment of indications ranging from neuropathic pain and drug dependence. Target indication validated in vivo with tool compound TrpGc. In vitro binding of inhibitors confirmed using ITC and high resolution x ray crystallography. In vivo studies with lead compounds pending. This technology is now available for license The University is excited to partner with industry to see this innovation reach its potential.

Selective bromodomain protein inhibitors that reduce cancer cell viability, Bromodomain and extraterminal domain BET proteins have been repeatedly implicated in inflammation heart disease diabetes and cancer making them enticing targets for the development of potential therapeutics. However it has been challenging to develop inhibitors selective enough to pass clinical trials due to dose limiting toxic side effects. Researchers at the University of Minnesota carried out detailed structure activity relationship studies resulting in the development of compounds that specifically inhibit BRD4 BD1 and avoid off target interactions with other proteins including bromodomain containing proteins . BET proteins function as readers of epigenetic modifications on the genome modulating transcription and regulating cellular processes including cell proliferation and cell differentiation. For example the BET protein BRD4 interacts with super enhancer regions regulating c Myc expression a protein that is implicated in as many as 50 of all cancers. A previously identified BET inhibitor also inhibited other bromodomain containing proteins and p38 kinase. Based off of crystal structures of inhibitors bound to the kinase or BRD4 researchers modified the compound to enhance BET activity while reducing kinase activity gt 90 000 fold. Further modifications increased cell permeability of the molecule. Therapeutic potential of the compound was demonstrated through verifying activity against cancer cells MM.1S cells which was further supported by reduced c Myc expression. In vitro proof of concept. Molecules have been systematically designed and optimized for selective inhibition of BET proteins specifically BRD4 BD1 and shown to have activity against cancer cells reducing c Myc expression in tissue culture.

Therapeutic compound for chronic inflammatory pain without dependence or tolerance, Opioids like morphine have been used extensively for the treatment of chronic pain including pain that is the result of diseases like cancer AIDS and sickle cell disease. The analgesic effect from activation of the mu opioid receptor MOR is unfortunately accompanied by undesirable side effects including tolerance and dependence. Furthermore the administration of morphine and other opioids has been shown to actually enhance HIV infection in patients. To overcome these limitations researchers at the University of Minnesota developed a two part molecule MCC22 that activates MOR to deliver analgesic effects while antagonizing CCR5 to suppress opioid induced side effects. Although mu opioids reduce pain chronic use promotes increased pain sensitivity through the release of pro inflammatory chemokines including CCL5. This chemokine binds CCR5 which colocalizes with MOR in glia and neurons and the CCL5 CCR5 complex plays a major role in neuroinflammation. CCR5 is also the main co receptors utilized by HIV 1 viruses to enter cells and accelerate AIDS progression. Through activating MOR and blocking CCR5 MCC22 is a potent analgesic that mitigates the pain sensitivity and neuroinflammation commonly associated with opioids. Furthermore MC22 inhibits immune cell migration into the central nervous system which is a critical step in HIV mediated neuropathogenesis that leads to NeuroAIDS. MCC22 shows promise as a treatment of both inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions where conventional analgesics have reduced efficacy. In vivo animal studies. MCC22 exhibits potent analgesic properties and no observed tolerance in mice. Shown to be effective for reducing pain in a mouse model of sickle cell disease chemotherapy induced pain and arthritis.

Synchronized Multi-Modal Tinnitus Therapy, Prof. Lim at the University of Minnesota has developed a new method to suppress and potentially cure tinnitus using synchronized multi modal stimulation of the brain. The technology consists of algorithms and devices that non invasively or transcutaneously stimulate auditory and non auditory pathways in a highly synchronized fashion. The technique stems from the hypothesis that tinnitus patients who experience abnormal brain representations continue to retain the normal original brain representations and by shocking specific regions of the brain the brain can be switched back to the normal representation. Using highly synchronized multi modal stimulation of specific regions in the brain this technology acts as a neural switch that can switch neural activity to suppress tinnitus and phantom limb pain. Tinnitus the perception of sound with no external source affects 15 20 of the population and currently has no cure. Existing therapies include medications using masking noises or simply retraining the brain using individually programmed tonal music. While these methods eases tinnitus to a certain degree they do not address the underlying cause. The technology disclosed here on the other hand induces a strong synchronous shock to specific regions of the brain to reset it from an abnormal state back to the normal state. Owing to such novel method of action this non invasive treatment technology has the potential to successfully switch the firing pattern of tinnitus affected neurons to suppress and cure tinnitus and phantom limb pain.

Mouse models of tau variants linked to neurodegenerative disease, The vast majority of therapies found to be effective in mouse models of neurodegeneration fail in humans. This failure to translate highlights the need to ensure that transgenic animal models are created with intense attention to detail to increase relevance and understanding of the associated limitations. Mutation P301L in the protein tau encoded by the MAPT gene is a common mutation linked to neurodegeneration and represents an important area of focus. The mouse model currently used to study this mutation rTg4510 has a 70 copy tau transgene insertion in a 244 kb deletion of another gene Fgf14 . These additional genomic changes confound the observed phenotypes which may or may not be due to the P301L mutation of interest. The lab of Dr. Michael Koob at the University of Minnesota has carefully developed a cleaner mouse model for the purpose of studying the role of the Tau P301L mutant in neurodegeneration. This transgenic mouse includes a single targeted MAPT cDNA insertion that expresses tauP301L T2 mouse .

A novel chemotherapy drug with reduced patient side-effects, 16 556 690 Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide as such research efforts abound to develop improved therapeutic treatment options. Chemotherapeutic drugs often work through causing DNA damage in cancer cells to elicit anti tumor responses and cell death. Unfortunately this DNA damage also occurs in healthy cells leading to serious side effects and increasing the risk of future cancer. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a small molecule 4Ei 10 that achieves its anti cancer effects in two ways 1 blocking cell proliferation through inhibiting translation of new proteins and 2 inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through induction of the potent anti cancer protein p53. Unlike current chemotherapeutic drugs that upregulate p53 4Ei 10 does so without causing DNA damage likely circumventing both burdensome side effects and the risk of developing new cancer. The dual mode of action of 4Ei 10 has the potential to act as a double edged sword against particularly aggressive cancers and could replace or reduce the dosages of traditional problematic chemotherapeutic drugs.

3D tumor models for accurate testing of therapeutics, The hunt for cancer therapies continues to be a major field of study in academia and industry. Unfortunately many anti cancer drugs with promising in vitro efficacy are found to be ineffective in vivo. This is due in large part to the limitations of current in vitro models. Conventional 2D monolayer cell cultures cannot accurately mimic characteristics of native tumor microenvironments and current 3D cultured tumor cells while able to more closely mimic natural behaviors still cannot model the tumor microenvironment. To better utilize resources including time research animals and funds and increase clinical translation models that more accurately mimic both tumor environment and behavior are needed. To that end researchers at the University of Minnesota developed a method to bioprint 3D tumor models with increased functionality and relevance bridging the gap between 2D cell cultures and animal models. The design incorporates the vasculature and stromal elements involved in tumor microenvironments e.g. tumor cells fibroblasts and blood vessels . The model also facilitates control of tumor cell migration and angiogenesis by creating chemical gradients of growth factors using 3D printed stimuli responsive capsules. Altogether this approach recapitulates physiological cell to cell cell to extracellular matrix ECM and cell to chemical signal interactions with precise spatiotemporal resolution. In addition the constructs consist of human cells rendering them more clinically relevant and versatile with the option to incorporate a patient's own cells for precise selection of effective therapies.This innovation provides a powerful tool for understanding the mechanism of cancer metastasis screening drugs and testing patient specific therapies.

Augmented non-invasive hearing system , This technology is a noninvasive hearing multiplexing device that uses ultrasound signals to transmit audible sounds by exploiting cochlear regions that are under utilized. The device which is attached to the head neck region sends modulated ultrasonic signals to vibrate brain fluids. This vibration in turn produces audible sound signals in channels that are typically not used. As the signals are sent as vibrations through brain fluid the airborne sound coming through the ear canal remains undisturbed. In other words the device can be used to perform multiplexing with the cochlea to send desired sound signals in new perceptual channels without affecting normal hearing. Humans can hear sound signals in frequency ranging from 20Hz to 20kHz. However some frequencies in this range are attenuated by the outer middle ear e.g. below 100Hz and above 8kHz . The technology described here uses modulated ultrasonic signals to enable hearing in those under used frequencies. Multiple transmitters can be used to simultaneously stimulate different regions of the cochlea without distorting airborne sound. Such a technology can be utilized to send speech or other useful sound signals in a noisy environment such as construction sites war zone or manufacturing facilities. This technology can be integrated with cell phones and other consumer products. This technology may also be used to develop new types of music production that combines normal sound along with ultrasound hearing. The device and accompanying algorithm can be optimized based on individual s hearing preference and anatomy.

"Multimodal Synchronization, Sound &amp; Electrical Stimulation, Hearing Aid (mSync-hEAR) ", The technology is a hearing aid device with an integrated electrical stimulator to use for enhanced hearing rehabilitation. Electrodes are attached to different parts of the ear to provide precisely timed electrical stimulations relative to acoustic signals transmitted from the hearing aid. Application of synchronized acoustic and electrical stimulation is used to suppress or enhance activity in the auditory system. The suppression of neural activity can be used for the treatment of hearing conditions such as Tinnitus and hyperacusis. This device can also be used to enhance hearing aid effectiveness. Combining electrical stimulation of the ear region with precise timing relative to the sound input can alter activity in the auditory system. Based on the nature and time of electrical stimuli the activity in the auditory system can either be enhanced or suppressed. The device features the ability to modify these signal parameters in real time enabling the user to change the sensitivity towards certain sound signals on the go. This multimodal synchronization therapeutic device can be used to enhance hearing rehabilitation balance hearing across different energy ranges and suppress other hearing ailments. The device features a wireless module that can be used to power and control the device remotely.

Non-invasive Neuromodulation for Reversible Modulation of Neural Activity, Non invasive techniques to reversibly modulate neural activity can be valuable in research diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Researchers at the University of Minnesota recently discovered that transcranial low intensity focused ultrasound tFUS can reversibly suppress evoked responses and modulate functions within the nervous system. This technology uses a high precision dual mode phased array ultrasound system to deliver tFUS neuromodulation signals to target nervous tissues with high spatial resolution voxel size lt 2 cubic mm . Using specific parameters tFUS can reversibly modulate neural activity by non invasively heating a spatially restricted volume of neural tissue without histological damage. This technology has also been shown to have superior temporal and spatial resolution when compared to other neuromodulation platforms such as transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS and transcranial direct current stimulation tcDCS . Professor Emad Ebbini s team has demonstrated suppression of somatosensory evoked potentials using tFUS in rodents. Activity suppression is found to be highly correlated and temporally consistent with in vivo temperature changes. Noninvasive heating of spatially restricted volume of neural tissue without damage may provide a method of temporarily suppressing specific neural pathways or controlling networks through multiple foci. This technology may also be useful in investigating the basis of disease and neural function. Focused thermal neuromodulation pairs a method of noninvasive investigation of the underlying locations and networks of diseases of the central nervous system with a monitored treatment platform.

A discrete and effective wearable breast pump for nursing mothers, Due to its health benefits the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding infants for a minimum of one year a goal that only 35 of babies in the US reach. A barrier to breastfeeding for many mothers is the difficulty in pumping milk a practice commonly cited as inefficient time consuming and both physically and socially uncomfortable. This is in large part due to the currently commercially available breast pumps that stimulate milk production using suction. These pumps are noisy require a user to partially disrobe and necessitates access to a power outlet physically isolating women from carrying out tasks and fully participating in the work place. Compounding the problem these pumps poorly mimic infant s stimulation of milk and many women report increased discomfort and decreased milk output which adds to the challenges. A group of researchers at the University of Minnesota s Medical Devices Center have come up with a solution to take the suck out of pumping literally. They have developed a concealed wearable breast pump that uses mechanical compression instead of vacuum suction and warmth to mimic infant stimulation for milk expression. The mechanical stimulation which uses data determined pressure and pattern specifications is capable of increasing milk output and also allows the pump to operate quietly compared to vacuum driven pumps.The pump is also designed as a wearable device that can be concealed under clothing facilitating a woman to pump discreetly while continuing to carry out tasks in the workplace or the home. This technology empowers mothers to more fully engage in their careers and daily lives while still prioritizing their baby by lessening the physical and opportunity costs associated with pumping milk.

A TLR-2 stimulatory molecule for use as a vaccine adjuvant, Application 16 447 721 Adjuvants are required to potentiate the immune response to increase efficacy and longevity of many vaccines. The need for new adjuvants is becoming increasingly recognized. The few adjuvants that are commercially available fall into a small number of classes and the creation of new adjuvants has been hindered by issues of toxicity. Using systematic high throughput screening the very first heterocyclic small molecule capable of simulating the immune receptor TLR 2 was identified. Through stimulation of cytokines and chemokines this molecule 9 fluoro 7 hydroxy 3 methyl5 oxo N pyridin 3 ylmethyl 2 3 dihydro 1H 5H pyrido 3 2 1 ij quinoline 6 carboxamide is available for development as an adjuvant in vaccines as well as in the treatment of certain cancers. Currently the two most common adjuvants are aluminum or lipopeptide based. Aluminum alone is a poor inducer of T cell response which is necessary particularly for protein or subunit based vaccines. While lipopetide based adjuvants are much better at priming T cells to respond to introduced antigen they suffer from problems of aggregation which complicates their purification and characterization. This technology has the potential to overcome both of these hurdles through activation of TLR 2 via a novel structure avoiding issues of aggregation . This class of compounds has the potential to serve as a potent adjuvant alone or in combination for a wide variety of vaccines reducing the antigen concentration required in vaccines as well as the overall number of immunizations necessary to confer protection leading to more cost effective vaccines. TLR 2 stimulating compounds have also shown promise for potentiating T cell responses against tumors making this molecule a prime target for development as an anti cancer therapeutic.

A Single Device for Vaginal Dilation and Flushing , This medical device is a modular vaginal dilation and flushing device that helps improve patient compliance and prevent serious postoperative complications associated with vaginoplasty. Patient compliance is improved by reducing the number of painful dilation and douching procedures required during the 90 days post op period. The device can be used for preventing both acute and chronic post op complications including risks of infection necrosis due to uneven pressure vaginal stenosis and neovaginal prolapse. By exploiting a stent design the device reduces severe complications caused by vaginal packing with lubricated gauze and frequent insertion and removal of hard plastic dilators. This all in one modular device replaces lubricated gauze plastic dilators and the douching mechanisms that are commonly used in perioperative and postoperative period following a vaginoplasty procedure. The device is designed to simultaneously provide uniform radial support to the neovaginal cavity as well as facilitate douching procedures. The flexible stent layer and soft external layer reduces pain during dilation cleaning procedures thereby improving patient compliance and reducing the risk of tissue trauma infection skin slough or vaginal prolapse. Channels built in the device promote coating of douching fluid to the entire neovagina providing a better clean than typical douching. 
Tau-targeting Peptides Treat Neurodegenerative Diseases, New membrane permeable synthetic peptides could slow the progression of Alzheimer s disease AD and other tauopathies. These new peptides inhibit tau phosphorylation by targeting specific and multiple phosphorylation sites. This halts disease progression by inhibiting tau mislocalization to dendritic spines and subsequent tau mediated neural deficits. The technology is anticipated to treat Alzheimer s disease and other tau associated neurodegenerative conditions e.g. frontotemporal dementia traumatic brain injury chronic traumatic encephalopathy . Alzheimer s disease AD has two main pathological hallmarks beta amyloid A forming plaques and neurofibrillary tangles containing phosphorylated tau protein. No therapeutics currently exist that can slow or stop AD progression. Hyperphosphorylation of tau is associated with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Preventing hyperphosphorylation has become a key strategy. Previous attempts to treat AD by blocking tau phosphorylation failed because inhibiting the kinases including CDK5 and GSK3 also shuts down other necessary cellular processes leading to high toxicity. These two new peptides termed WT and AP prevent tau hyperphosphorylation. They act as targets for kinases so they do not hyperphosphorylate the tau protein. The WT peptide acts as a competitive inhibitor for the two kinases the peptide becomes phosphorylated and native tau is not hyperphosphorylated. The AP modified peptide is unable to be phosphorylated but instead binds with the kinases essentially distracting the kinases from native tau by so they phosphorylate native tau to a lesser extent. Because the peptides do not affect the global kinase activities of CDK5 and GSK3 they are likely to be highly effective without high toxicity. 
Wound closure device, Typical wound closure is done by sewing sutures through the opening and pulling the strands together. It presumes the clinician has ready access to the site and free hands fingers to perform the closure and that the sutures do not get entangled during the closing.

This design allows clinicians to close the wound with minimal demand on their hands freeing them to address other portions of the anatomy and or operate other equipment simultaneously. In addition this design provides reliable wound closure regardless of clinicians skill level. TRL 4 5 Prototype developed and tested in an emulated environment. This technology is now available for

"Sustainable triblock copolymers as strong, tunable, and degradable pressure sensitive adhesives", Pressure sensitive adhesives PSAs are widely used in many applications such as sticky notes labels tape and stamps due to their facile adhesion to substrates with a minimal applied force. Most commercial pressure sensitive adhesive PSA materials are derived from fossil resources which are not sustainable. These materials are often poorly degradable and result in residual adhesive problems during the paper recycling process in pulping facilities. To address these issues researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a new method to prepare novel PSA materials from renewable resources with high bio based contents gt 90 . Specifically a series of ABA triblock copolymers were designed and successfully synthesized with corn derived poly lactide PLA as the glassy end blocks and poly pentadecyl caprolactone PPDCL containing a long alkyl C15 substituent as the rubbery B central block. This PPDCL is a new aliphatic polyester that was synthesized from cashewnut shell liquid derived lactones in a controlled and tunable fashion. The new PSA material exhibits adhesion properties competitive with commercial adhesives such as duct tape with the added benefit of renewable bio based contents and hydrolytic degradability. Proof of concept. Materials were synthesized and experimentally characterized at lab scale.

Biodegradable lactose-based hydrogel , Several million tons of lactose and lactose rich milk permeate is produced as byproducts every year. To utilize these waste products few methods to prepare lactose containing polymers have been proposed. Of those methods many rely on multistep synthesis of monomers often involving protecting group chemistry and organic solvents. Applying green chemistry principles researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a simple novel method for the preparation of hydrogels composed of lactose containing polymers. This method involves an environmentally friendly atom economical reaction conducted in water to synthesize lactose based methacrylic monomers and methacrylic acid as a byproduct. This method allows for synthesis of the hydrogel through a simple pH adjustment of the reaction mixture followed by photopolymerization. In addition to the light induced polymerization the entire process is carried out in a single pot making this process highly energy efficient enabling synthesis at ambient temperature and polymerization at high rates. The researchers have demonstrated that the water uptake rheological and other physical properties can be tuned easily by varying the ratio of methacrylic anhydride to lactose. In addition the process was shown to produce hydrogel with comparable properties with milk permeate as received from a cheese processing plant in place of reagent grade lactose. Process Material produced at lab scale and experimentally characterized. This technology is now available for license.

Topographically conforming self-fitting garments made of active materials, Conventionally garments are made to fit complex body shapes using undersized elastic garments and or closure devices such as braces ties cuffs etc. Undersized garments can be too tight or too loose and rely on a few contact areas on the wearer s body where tension can be applied resulting in poor aesthetics. Closure devices on the other hand can add to manufacturing complexity and diminish the overall aesthetics. Conventional fabric and fastening mechanisms are even more unfavorable in medical wearables where both uniform compression and continual contact to moving wearer s body is often necessary utilizing molding technique or foam inserts to address this problem has been ineffective and laborious. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a new method to create self fitting fabrics that can conform over complex surfaces such as the human body while maintaining constant compression. This fabric made by knitting filaments of NiTi based active materials can be programmed to shape shift and conform to remain in continual contact with the wearer's body even while the wearer is moving changing postures. In this invention conformity around concave and convex surfaces is achieved by creating spatially varying functional properties through intelligent combination of different knit patterns. The ability to architecture functionally graded active fabric based on knitting pattern and material properties offers a level of unparalleled resolution in creating topographical conformation to highly complex surfaces.

Engineered enzymes to disrupt bacterial communication and reduce virulence, 62 816 403 Bacteria are a major source of infections in both plants and animals as well as contamination of food products. The consequences of rampant bacterial growth can range from loss of product and capital in the livestock and agricultural industries to illness and loss of life in animal and human health . Quorum sensing mediated by acyl homoserine latonces AHLs has been implicated in regulating bacterial virulence factors in pathogens including Vibrio cholerae cholera Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis and Staphylococcus aureus hospital acquired infections . The pathogenicity of bacterial plant pathogens including Pectobacterium spp. soft rot and blackleg disease Erwinia amylovora fire blight disease and Pseudomonas syringae opportunistic plant pathogen is also regulated by quorum sensing. Given the widespread occurrence of antibiotic resistance it is imperative to find new modalities to combat pathogenic bacteria. Targeting AHLs to decrease or limit the expression of virulence factors could be a powerful tool to combat costly plant animal and human pathogens. Lactonase enzymes that degrade AHLs are being explored as a novel way to inhibit expression of virulence factors and reduce the pathogenicity of bacteria. Bacterial pathogenicity is linked to robust expression of virulence factors. AHL signaling molecules that are widely secreted by bacteria for quorum sensing are implicated in activating the expression of virulence genes and exacerbating infections. Lactonases enzymes that degrade AHLs are a viable and novel strategy to interrupt quorum sensing and therefore mitigate against bacterial infections. University of Minnesota researchers have engineered lactonases in order to maximize enzyme stability and activity against a wide variety of AHLs. These enzymes are capable of disrupting bacterial communication and reducing virulence. The improved solubility stability and longevity profile of these enzymes makes them ideal anti infectives. Specifically they can be incorporated in a variety of solvents or coatings thus rendering them readily deployable on most surfaces. Engineered lactonases are also appealing since their mode of action is outside the cells and are unlikely to elicit survival mechanisms that increase the likelihood of resistance development. These enzymes have been found to be non toxic in animal feed studies and could be used to control microbial infections in the livestock industry in crop production and post harvest crop storage. Engineered lactonases have the potential to mitigate crop and livestock contamination without the introduction of chemical antibiotics into the food chain.

Engineered enzymes to disrupt and prevent biofilms, 62 816 403 Bacterial biofilms are significant health challenges. It is estimated that 80 of all microbial infections and 60 of healthcare associated infections HAI in humans are caused by biofilms. The societal costs of HAIs are estimated at between 96 to 147 billion annually. Biofilms are characteristically slimy collections of bacteria surrounded by a matrix of DNA proteins and polysaccharides that can adhere to and grow on a variety of surfaces. Because of the pervasive nature of bacteria biofilms are incredibly common and can form on substrates ranging from structural materials to living tissue. As sources of contamination infection and biocorrosion biofilms cause of an astounding array of problems including food contamination and rot contamination of medical devices and a wide variety of human and animal infections. Biofilms are inherently resistant to antimicrobial agents and their physically sticky nature makes them challenging to treat and dislodge. A key step in the formation of many biofilms is bacterial communication through molecules known as quorum signals. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have engineered enzymes to break down quorum sensing molecules as a novel way to inhibit bacterial communication and disrupt or prevent biofilm formation. Bacterial communication is vital for the formation of biofilms and interfering with this communication may mitigate against biofilm formation. Bacteria often secrete acyl homoserine lactones AHLs a molecule required for quorum sensing and biofilm formation. AHLs are degraded by the enzyme lactonase. University of Minnesota researchers have engineered lactonases in order to maximize enzyme stability and activity against a wide variety of lactones. These enzymes are capable of disrupting bacterial communication and preventing biofilm formation. The improved solubility stability and longevity profile of these enzymes makes them ideal anti infectives. Specifically they can be incorporated in a variety of solvents or coatings thus rendering them readily deployable on most surfaces. Significant human and veterinary medicine applications are possible where biofilm control is critical for example biofilms associated with cystic fibrosis bacterial endocarditis and urinary tract infections.

"Environmentally-friendly, enzymatic anticorrosion and antifouling coating", 62 816 403 More than 300 Billion is lost from the US economy every year due to metal corrosion. Where metal structures are submerged underwater bacteria drastically speed up corrosion through the formation of complex microbial communities called biofilms. Multiple approaches have been attempted to combat biocorrosion including the use of biocidal compounds which show low efficacy against biofilms and pose an environmental hazard due to their toxicity. Biofilms also lead to biofouling the adherence of larger macroorganisms which is detrimental to numerous industries including transportation oil industry aquaculture air conditioning etc. Similar to the approaches taken to combat biocorrosion antifouling approaches are dominated by copper a toxic metal that harms the environment and is challenged by regulation. Research out of the University of Minnesota has developed an alternative solution to bypass these limitations. A key step in the formation of many biofilms is bacterial communication through molecules known as quorum signals. By incorporating enzymes engineered to break down quorum signals into steel coatings researchers were able to reduce biocorrosion by 50 . Bacterial communication is vital for the formation of biofilms and subsequent biofouling and interfering with this communication may mitigate against biofilm formation. Bacteria often secrete acyl homoserine lactones AHLs a molecule required for quorum sensing and biofilm formation. AHLs are degraded by the enzyme lactonase. University of Minnesota researchers have engineered lactonases in order to maximize enzyme stability and activity against a wide variety of lactones. These improved enzymes are soluble in a variety of solvents including organic or coatings and retain activity long term. Studies with submerged steel surfaces coated with lactonase containing coating showed a 50 reduction in corrosion tubercles compared to surfactin 31 and magnesium peroxide 36 coatings. The robustness of these enzymes and their ability to combat biofilms and biofilm mediated corrosion or clogging lends them to a wide variety of industrial applications. These applications include coatings for boat hulls underwater structures plumbing fish tanks fracking and oil pipes or as a coating or spray for surfaces to prevent contamination or infection.

Large 3D Printed Skull Window for Neuroscience Researc, This technology is a method for creating a large optically clear window in the skull that facilitates basic neuroscience research over a larger section of the brain. The technology has two components This technology greatly expands the arsenal of neuroscience tools and therapies that can be used for basic research and pharmaceutical applications that require optical access to the brain. Light based neurotherapies are difficult to use in vivo. The currently accepted method of obtaining optical access to the brain is to excise a section of skull implant a planar glass coverslip and shine light through the cranial window. This method offers good resolution but a small field of view. It can also deform the brain and damage the underlying tissue disrupting therapies and experiments. Other technologies e.g. skull thinning light emitting probes optical probe insertion and wavefront shaping suffer from poor resolution a small field of view or both. This new technology is minimally invasive has low surgical variability reduces tissue damage and dramatically increases field of view. The three dimensional geometry of the implants allow excision of much larger sections of the skull allowing for access to a much wider region of the brain. 
Directional Coordinated Reset Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), This technology is a system for coordinated reset deep brain stimulation CR DBS which uses a segmented DBS array electrodes and short term electrical pulses delivered in a fixed or varying sequence. This therapy uses multiple contacts in different locations of the target brain structure to offer flexibility to CR contact configuration and intensity selection. In some cases this can also provide flexibility to cross structure CR configuration. In addition a novel stimulation strategy delivers high stimulation intensity at the beginning of treatment until optimal therapeutic improvement is achieved and then reduces the stimulation to a low intensity to maintain the therapeutic effect. Directional CR DBS could be used to treat nervous system or multiple movement disorders e.g. Parkinson's disease essential tremor dystonia and other neurological and or psychiatric conditions . Traditional isochronal DBS while a successful treatment for Parkinson's disease has not changed for decades. Constant high frequency stimulation from the traditional DBS drains the device battery within several years requiring risky battery replacement surgeries. In addition current spread related side effects limit its application and therapeutic window. Directional CR DBS combines new DBS lead technology and a novel strategy to produce a comparable or even better therapeutic effect than traditional DBS therapies and with fewer side effects. Because it uses a very low stimulation intensity one third or less than traditional isochronal DBS it significantly reduces battery consumption. 
Active Knit Compression Stockings, Active knit compression garments dynamically apply compression to various areas of the body for medical athletic and aerospace applications. The technology uses knitted garments that integrate shape memory alloy SMA wires trained through an annealing process to remember a straight or slightly curved form. When heated the SMA wires return to those trained forms to cause the knit to contract providing active compression. The knitted garments can wrap around the body in the form of leg sleeves arm sleeves or body wraps. The garments give the wearer dynamic control by providing variable levels of functional compression which is determined by the properties of the SMA knit stitch type size and structure and temperature of the SMA knit. Current compression garments include large inflatable garments tethered to inflation sources or passive elastic stockings that are not only difficult to put on take off but do not apply controllable or dynamic pressures on the body. This new active knit compression technology combines the mobility and low profile features of the passive knit compression stockings with the dynamic and controllable features of the inflatable garments. Using shape memory alloy materials trained to return to specific forms when heated this technology is lightweight low profile and provides dynamic control over the amount of pressure exerted. 
Multi-compartment Biopsy Syringe , Collect multiple samples in independent chambers using a novel multi compartment syringe designed for fine needle aspiration FNA for lymph node and nodule mass biopsies. The design features independent compartments within the syringe and a hand pump mechanism to expel contents of each chamber independently. This device eliminates the need for multiple syringes during a single procedure. It is envisioned to be an add on to commercially available FNA needles. At present EBUS and EUS procedures require three separate syringes which is both time consuming and inefficient. This new device fits current FNA needles used for these procedures and offers a more efficient and ergonomic means of collecting and expelling needle contents. 
Quality Control Test for Pathogenic Bacteria Contaminated Water, A fast simple and accurate quality control test can determine water quality where a very dilute level of contamination by pathogenic bacteria is suspected. The test uses a novel dielectrophoresis DEP step that concentrates and recovers a high fraction of bacteria. Then inactivated free DNA from no longer viable bacteria allows nucleic acid amplification technology to measure DNA concentrations from only the pathogenic species. The DEP step improves bacterial recovery enough that smaller quantities of water can be used and the unique nucleic acid primers identify specific genes of the live pathogenic bacteria without also tagging other bacteria. This technology can be used for endoscope reprocessing quality testing an area of particular concern due to the recent number of patient infections and deaths caused by cross contamination of incompletely processed endoscopes. Monitoring water quality is important not only for municipal water suppliers but also in the medical field. In particular measuring water quality of rinsate from medical instrumentation e.g. endoscopes can determine if a device has been cleaned adequately. A key requirement is the ability to detect small quantities of pathogens i.e. as low as 1 CFU mL of sample and to do so quickly enough to determine if rinse water needs further treatment or medical devices need more cleaning. Current water tests that measure metabolic pathway components as a proxy for the presence of organisms are limited in that these markers are not specific to pathogens or viable bacteria and the tests are not sensitive at the low levels required. Other tests that culture samples from water require a 12 to 48 hour incubation before producing results too long a wait for many applications. This new test is fast simple and accurate. It works with dilute levels of pathogenic bacterial contamination as well as with smaller water samples. 
Suture-free Chest Tube Stabilizing Device, A novel device secures a chest tube in place without sutures during tube thoracostomy TT and procedures involving indwelling tubes. Implementing the stabilizing device is fast and does not require daily management. The easy to use device keeps the chest tube in place under normal conditions during patient movement and while stripping the tube. Patient satisfaction is high because it is reliable comfortable and allows for greater patient movement. Tube removal is easy and safe as it can prevent related skin necrosis and scarring. The device can be removed when the tube is removed or it can be left in place to protect the incision site and ensure proper healing. The device attaches to the skin with an adhesive patch and two caps Current suture gauze methods used for anchoring chest tubes during tube thoracostomy TT face a number of issues relatively long procedure times tube dislodgement skin necrosis daily care limited options for airtight removal and unpleasant scarring. This novel chest tube stabilizing device was designed to overcome these challenges. It is more reliable easier and faster to implement and more secure than traditional sutures. Its design expedites patient care and reduces adverse events caused by tube dislodgement. 
Catheter Based Targeted Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenator (ECMO), A novel catheter system performs a targeted form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO during cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR to provide blood to the heart and brain during cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock. The targeted cardio cerebral ECMO TC ECMO system is easy for average trained less specialized healthcare personnel to use it provides time to transfer the patient to a higher level medical center i.e. one with an ECMO team . The procedure supplies oxygenated blood to the portion of the aorta where the cerebral and coronary arteries originate. The system consists of an aortic catheter and a venous catheter placed in the inferior vena cava connected to an external semi automated oxygenator and pump that requires very minimal operator intervention while transporting the patient. The device is inserted via the femoral artery and vein and has two balloons that inflate one blocks the descending aorta and the other blocks the inferior vena cava. The device is expected to improve survival rate and neurological outcomes in cardiac arrest patients. It can also be used to support the circulation in patients undergoing high risk coronary artery interventions and in patients with cardiogenic shock. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR chest compressions is associated with poor survival outcomes and high incidence of neurological deficits mostly because it cannot provide sufficient amount of oxygenated blood to the vital organs i.e. heart and brain . Combining CPR with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECPR improves survival and neurological outcomes however its use is limited to large hospitals that have specialized teams available around the clock. Another limitation is that ECMO uses very large arterial and venous cannulas that require special expertise for placement and may lead to high failure and complication rates. The TC ECMO system overcomes many of these limitations and offers numerous benefits including Exclusively delivers oxygenated blood to the brain and heart Easier to place than ECMO can be easily implemented in the emergency department doesn t require highly trained personnel Provides a temporizing measure to allow more cardiac arrest patients access to ECPR hence saves more lives Smaller cannulas and fewer vascular complications Expected improvement in survival rate and neurological outcomes Delivers more blood to the brain than chest compression Portable small external unit Requires minimal human intervention Superior to regular ECMO in bleeding patients 
Ultrasound-based Hearing Aid, A novel ultrasound hearing aid noninvasively restores hearing by activating the auditory system of the brain. The technology uses ultrasound stimulation to create waves and vibrations in the brain fluids. These waves and vibrations vibrate cochlear fluids through the inner ear canal which activates the auditory brain and induces hearing. The ultrasound can also vibrate cochlear fluids directly to induce hearing. The method bypasses all potentially damaged pathways e.g. ear canal eardrum middle ear bones ossicles stapes round window interface and or cochlear malformations . The device uses modulated and burst patterns with low intensities typically within the 100kHz to 1MHz range so it is feasible for daily use. The device would be designed with unique configurations of ultrasound transducers placed on the head or even in different neck body regions. The number and location of the transducers would be optimized for each patient during fitting. A behind the ear or body worn device processor with a microphone picks up sound signals and extracts them to the transducers. The ultrasound hearing aid features four major advantages over conventional hearing aids 
Soft Catheter Surgical Robot for Heart Disease, A new type of soft surgical robot capable of safely travelling through vasculature offers surgical robotic benefits in treating cardiovascular disease CVD . The worm like design is based on fiber reinforced elastomeric enclosures FREE . It features hydraulically powered actuators with pressure threshold valves offering integrated sensing and precision control at the end effector. The robot can anchor itself within vasculature using minimal force and will not block blood flow. Combining FREE actuators enables bidirectional traversal steering and anchoring for interventional procedures by the catheter tip e.g. atherectomy . The technology can be combined with other tools such as closed loop laser photoablation and fiber optic tissue sensing to realize safe closed loop precision tissue removal in transvascular conditions with semi or fully automated control. Heart disease remains a leading cause of death yet no safe minimally invasive and lasting clinical intervention currently exists to treat it. Stent usage is declining and proving clinically inferior to invasive bypass surgery. This new unprecedented design provides an inherently safe method of removing plaque while extending the benefits of surgical robotics into the cardiovascular and transvascular space. 
Point-of-care Concussion Therapy, A wearable technology uses light therapy to speed brain recovery in a new point of care concussion therapy. The adjustable headgear device designed like a helmet provides homogeneous low level near infrared light for application to the entire head speeding concussion recovery by helping the brain produce more of the energy needed for healing. The wearable device provides compensating intensity for a uniform field through different parts of the skull. It offers a custom fit and is adjustable for hair density. In a traumatic brain injury acceleration and deceleration within the cranial vault leads to tearing and stretching of nerve fibers. Alteration of ionic balance and mitochondrial dysfunction makes it difficult for the cells to function while also limiting energy available for healing. Currently accepted therapies for traumatic brain injury are passive limited to rest and then physical therapy for symptoms. This new medical device can be used in an outpatient setting and may help patients return to work school faster while improving quality of life. 
Pre-surgical Pulmonary Nodule Localization Coil, A pre surgical pulmonary nodule localization coil system moves with a patient s respiratory cycle allowing the patient normal respiration without dislodging the device prior to surgery. The localization coil system has two components The localization coil is pre loaded into a delivery needle and a pusher rod inside the needle deploys the coil and allows the needle to retract without affecting the coil. Once deployed both the spring like coil and the suture keep the device in position and allow normal respiration. The device also helps a surgeon more easily locate the suture within the pleural space and simply follow the suture down to the coil. Current localization coils often become dislodged due to lung movement during patient respiration. Other localization methods using guidewires or metal coils risk injuring patients with large or complex structures such as hooks or barbs at the site of the lung nodule. With this technology the suture at the proximal end of a coil prevents the coil from dislodging from during the procedure. The design significantly simplifies deployment by reducing time and radiation exposure and increasing accuracy of localization. 
Scaffolds for Cancer Cell Ablation, A new cancer fighting technology uses non invasive local hyperthermia to kill metastasizing breast cancer cells. The approach builds upon existing poly caprolactone scaffolds that recruit and trap metastasizing breast cancer cells in vivo. An electrically conductive semi conductive metal disk placed in the center of the porous polymer scaffold can generate enough heat to kill cancer cells attached to the disk. The heat is generated through electromagnetic induction by an oscillating magnetic field within a radiofrequency coil. Tumor cells are recruited to the scaffold by immune cells and wound healing after thermal therapy creates an inflammatory environment that may facilitate future recruitment of tumor cells. This ability to noninvasively thermally ablate captured cells using biomaterial scaffolds could potentially extend focal thermal therapies to disseminated cancers. Breast cancer is a leading cause of death for women worldwide usually due to metastasis of the primary tumor to vital organs such as the lung liver and brain. Currently few therapeutic options exist for metastatic disease as cancer metastasis typically remains undetected until it is very advanced and often incurable. While focal therapies such as local application of heat have been successfully applied to solid tumors this novel approach applies non invasive local hyperthermia to disseminating tumor cells. Scaffolds have recently been shown to recruit metastasizing breast cancer cells very early in disease progression and their capture reduces tumor burden at other sites and improves survival. This new technology enhances the therapeutic potential of this approach by combining it with focal therapy thermal cryo or electrical to destroy the captured tumor cells. 
Compliant Aortic Stent Graft, 16 609 148 A double walled aortic stent graft is compliant to luminal pressure in the aorta. The outer layer of this new design is rigid similar to current stent grafts and the inner layer is comprised of a compliant flexible material that exhibits elastic properties similar to a healthy aorta. The space between the inner and outer layers can be filled i.e. with sterile saline to create a volume buffer between the layers so the stent graft becomes compliant to luminal pressure. When blood flows through the lumen of the inner layer the flexible walls can deform in a similar manner of a healthy vessel. This technology could decrease pressure induced stresses on the residual native aorta reduce risk of Stent graft Induced New Entry SINE dissections and potentially result in better systemic hypertension management dissections. Existing aortic endografts offer some flexibility along their length but are rigid across their diameters. Because they press outward against the aortic wall and do expand during systole they require greater energy from the native aorta to dissipate the systolic pressure wave. While these stent grafts may protect an acutely injured aorta from an aneurysm they could also damage the native aorta and require aggressive blood pressure management. This new double walled compliant design provides flexibility across the stent graft diameter. When the flexible wall of the inner layer deforms it behaves more like a healthy vessel. Increasing the compliance can improve peak systolic pressure and lead to better patient outcomes. 
ThermoDome Thermodilution Cardiac Output Catheter, The ThermoDome thermodilution cardiac output catheter significantly shortens the distance needed to measure cardiac output. Its unique design features multiple laser drilled holes at the distal end of the catheter. These holes create a mixing cloud that forces the body of the catheter to the center of the lumen and fully distributes cold saline in all directions. The technology consists of three main components While thermodilution has been used to measure cardiac output for years it is too inaccurate during low flow states e.g. times of advanced circulatory support such as ECMO and significant tricuspid valvular regurgitation back into the atrium . This new catheter and thermocouple design addresses these issues by reducing eliminating effects of significant tricuspid regurgitation accurately measuring cardiac output when parallel circuits are present evaluating cardiac output during percutaneous pulmonic valve implantation and accurately measuring shunt fractions particularly right to left shunts. 
Vascular Graft Identifies Endoleaks, A new vascular graft design may diagnose endoleaks without requiring CT scans or angiography. The technology monitors changes in arterial pressure that may indicate an endoleak. Specifically the technology coats existing PTFE or Dacron vascular grafts in carbon nanotubes or silver nanoparticles to create a pressure sensitive membrane. When the sleeves deform due to pressure changes an electrical signal is created. The signals are transmitted via radiofrequency to a receiver outside of the body. The receiver displays real time pressure readouts and wall shear stress of both the internal and external surface of the graft. Radiopaque markers provide fluoroscopic visual confirmation of the graft s orientation so the physician can reliably identify the areas of the graft under excessive stress or exhibiting signs of endoleaks. Current vascular grafts eliminate flow to an aneurysmal space thereby reducing or eliminating the risk of rupture. However when a vascular graft fails to completely divert blood flow an endoleak may result. Endoleaks are difficult to diagnose and current graft technologies have no way to monitor endoleads or provide feedback. This new technology provides real time active sensing of the vascular graft which may be used to diagnose endoleaks. The graft produces a three dimensional pressure map that spatially localizes differentiations in pressure measurements to assist physicians in localizing graft defects. 
Scan-Specific Machine Learning Reconstruction for MRI, An accelerated MRI reconstruction approach Robust Artificial neural networks for k space Interpolation RAKI improves the noise properties of GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partial Parallel Acquisition GRAPPA which translates to image acceleration i.e. faster scan times . This method learns a deep non linear convolutional neural network CNN from limited scan specific auto calibration signal ACS data and extends the linear convolutional kernels of GRAPPA while performing both training and reconstruction on a per image basis leading to marked performance improvement. The method also extends to k space interpolation techniques other than GRAPPA and it is directly applicable to 3D parallel imaging simultaneous multi slice imaging random undersampling and non Cartesian sampling. Long scan times remain a limiting factor in MRI often necessitating trade offs with spatial and temporal resolution or coverage. Accelerated imaging techniques are commonly required with parallel imaging e.g. SENSE or GRAPPA being the most clinically used approach. However image acceleration in parallel imaging is limited by the noise properties when estimating missing k space points in GRAPPA linear . While machine learning has previously been used in MRI it required large databases of MR images for rigorous training and relied on patterns across the training set rather than within each individual image. Until now no other methods use deep learning in k space in a self contained manner. Applying machine learning techniques to train neural networks for interpolating missing points in k space achieves higher acceleration rates and better noise properties. Once the CNN is trained the reconstruction takes on the order of milliseconds. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Pilot scale demonstration 
Acousto-electromagnetic Imaging of the Brain, Acousto electromagnetic imaging is a hybrid multimodal neuroimaging technology that fully integrates focused ultrasound with electromagnetic sensing and imaging for mapping dynamic electrophysical e.g. brain activation. The noninvasive technology achieves neuroimaging of brain activity with high spatio temporal resolution i.e. mm spatial resolution and ms temporal resolution and can detect and image dynamic brain activation and function at the neural circuit level in the brain as well as electrical activation in other organ systems e.g. the heart . Existing neuroimaging techniques like electroencephalography EEG or magnetoencephalography MEG can map brain activation with high temporal resolution but suffer from very limited spatial resolution. Other functional neuroimaging such as functional MRI has high spatial resolution but limited temporal resolution. This first of its kind acousto electromagnetic neuroimaging provides the high spatial resolution of ultrasound while offering the imaging neural activation capability of EEG MEG. As such this transformative neuroimaging modality could have a profound impact on cognitive neuroscience research clinical applications and diagnosing multiple neurological and mental brain disorders. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Concept 
Sliding Windowed Infinite Fourier Transform (SWIFT), The Sliding Windowed Infinite Fourier Transform SWIFT algorithm analyzes and extracts frequency amplitude phase information from digital signals in real time. This spectral analysis technique analyzes any real time digital signal from neural signals to accelerometer data to radio waves. The algorithm uses an infinite length causal exponential function as its window which gives more weight to more recent samples allowing SWIFT to be more sensitive to transient changes. This technology is guaranteed stable and has lower computational cost and memory requirements and improved frequency resolution and sampling as compared to other real time techniques. In addition a modified version SWIFT further reduces spectral leakage. The discrete Fourier transform DFT is the standard tool for spectral analysis in digital signal processing typically computed using the fast Fourier transform FFT . However for real time applications that require recalculating the DFT at each sample or only over a subset of the N center frequencies of the DFT the FFT is far from optimal. Sliding DFT SDFT computes individual DFT bins recursively but is only marginally stable and requires storing N previous inputs. Furthermore its rectangular window causes spectral leakage. The SWIFT technology overcomes these limitations and is faster requires less memory produces cleaner data can select any frequency and is more stable than currently used algorithms.

Multi-modal Neuromodulation Therapy Promotes Sleep, A new multi modal targeted approach to deep brain stimulation DBS therapy manages multiple symptoms simultaneously to treat various neurological and co morbid conditions. In particular the technology can help Parkinson s disease PD patients overcome co morbid sleep disturbances by using DBS waveforms and stimulation parameters to promote sleep. The technology uses the same electrodes to deliver different stimulation at night to the same targets stimulated during the day. Sensing and stimulation algorithms detect and monitor stages and quality of sleep via electrophysiological recordings in the same deep brain targets used to stimulate and treat PD motor symptoms. Delivering waveforms and patterns frequencies to these same targets at the appropriate times can modulate induce the next stage of sleep. The method can be expanded to other severe sleep disturbances as well as other eventual DBS indications with sleep co morbidity. DBS therapy treats PD motor symptoms when patients are awake but no method currently exists to treat the common sleep disturbances that can be more disabling and resistant to treatment than the motor symptoms. Pharmacological treatments can cause undesired side effects and their efficacy is complicated by PD medication regimens. This precise DBS approach targets several relevant nodes within brain circuitry to provide stimulation therapy while monitoring multiple symptoms for efficacy. It can be used as an extra stimulation setting in already extant DBS devices particularly those equipped for both stimulation and sensing . Many movement disorder patients with implanted DBS devices could benefit immediately from this approach which extends therapeutic efficacy by optimizing DBS devices for multiple symptoms. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Proof of concept. 
Magnetization Transfer Contrast Preparation, Multi Banded MB RF pulse Enhanced Magnetization Imaging MBE MTI uses multi banded RF pulses in MT preparation. These multi banded RF pulses not only provide simultaneous off resonance saturations of bound water spins on both sides of the central frequency of mobile water but also increase the coverage of off resonance frequency range without increasing the potential of direct saturations while eliminating the need to increase the gap between the central frequencies of mobile water and the MT RF pulse to maintain optimal MT contrast. Magnetization transfer imaging MTI usually requires increased bandwidth to achieve off resonance saturations of bound water spins within a large frequency range. A consequence of increasing the bandwidth is the undesired augmentation of direct saturation unless the MT pulses are shifted further away from the mobile water. However shifting the MT pulses further off resonance has its own disadvantages such as the decrease of MT contrast. This new method overcomes the limitations faced by traditional magnetization transfer contrast preparation. In addition the MBE MTI allows multiple frequency selection and amplitude modulation for each band of the MT RF pulses a unique feature that can target specific groups of macromolecules. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Pilot scale demonstration. Implemented and tested on Siemens Scanners at the CMRR. 
Tunable Neural Electrodes for MRI-Compatible Brain Signal Recordings, An MRI compatible electrode array records brain physiological signals in animals and humans. The array is manufactured with carbon nanotubes or other nano structured materials and will be tuned to have a magnetic susceptibility very close to that of brain tissue. Matching the magnetic susceptibilities of the electrode array and brain tissue will highly reduce or even eliminate magnetic imaging artifacts. In addition it will enable simultaneous acquisition of functional MRI fMRI images and neural physiological signals at the same spatial location in the brain. The electrodes can be used for MRI after deep brain stimulation DBS to determine the effects of treatments for brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease dystonia essential tremor depression epilepsy and obsessive compulsive disorder. Normally electrodes in the brain create a significant artifact that restricts the ability to obtain fMRI data at and near the electrode location. Obtaining co located and simultaneous fMRI and neural signals will help improve understanding of brain function and its treatment. These novel electrodes can overcome such challenges that currently prevent the use of MRI fMRI MRS for investigating the mechanisms underlying DBS treatment and for improving treatment efficacy. No electrode arrays tuned to match brain magnetic susceptibility currently exist. A combination of paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials in the appropriate volume ratios achieves a tuned magnetic susceptibility equal to that of brain tissue and doing so can eliminate magnetic image artifacts that hinder current technologies.

Neuromodulator for Simultaneous Stimulation and Signal Reception, A deep brain stimulation DBS electrode system allows simultaneous neuromodulation and reception of the neuronal response. The method provides electromagnetic EM stimulation using at least three probes for simultaneous modulation in pulsed and or continuous wave configuration with different wave forms. A multi strip multichannel array electrode generates rotating electric fields and the system can manipulate the amplitude and frequency of electromagnetic waves. The technology can also determine how neurons respond to the DBS treatment The stimulation is combined with simultaneous reception of the neuronal response using phase sensitive detection. Selective stimulation of neurons in DBS based on neuronal response makes this treatment ideal for diseases such as Parkinson's and epilepsy. This technology reduces tissue damage and provides selective localized and efficient stimulation of neurons resulting in safer more efficient and more effective DBS. Currently no neurostimulation systems can provide simultaneous stimulation of the nervous system as well as signal reception. Pulse frequency and amplitude for currently available DBS devices are adjusted based on the patient s behavior. The inability to accurately target specific neurons and adaptively stimulate based on neuronal feedback limits the efficacy of current neurostimulation systems. This new technology which borrows concepts from MRI systems allows greater control of electromagnetic signal delivery via several independent degrees of freedom. The device determines the location of the implanted electrode in the brain based on the response of the neuronal population and its simultaneous transmit and receive capabilities provide feedback and enable a closed loop system. In addition the device allows the study of neuronal activity in both healthy and diseased i.e. epileptic seizures states.

Multislice Multiband Excitation with Parallel Transmission for B1 Homogenization and Power Reduction, CN105143904B A new magnetic resonance imaging MRI parallel transmission pTx pulse design targets RF homogenization in multiband MB excitation and refocusing and other spin manipulations while limiting the specific absorption rate SAR . These pulses can significantly improve RF uniformity in each image slice while largely reducing global and local SAR. With full pTx hardware capable of synthesizing channel specific RF waveforms the new approach can design band specific pTx multi spoke RF pulses to improve signal and contrast uniformities while complying with both technical and safety limits. In the case of limited pTx capability for example that using phase and gain controllers to split a single RF output from the console the new approach also provides an effective strategy to design band joint pTx multi spoke pulses that outperform the traditional single transmit RF pulses. The new approach was originally validated in the human brain at 7T using a 16 channel pTx system. Most recently its utility for rapid acquisition of high resolution whole brain imaging has been demonstrated at 7T by using a commercial multi channel transmit RF coil Nova Medical and acquiring Human Connectome Project HCP style diffusion and functional MRI. The pulse design algorithm can be used offline or integrated into scanners and can be used with current 3T or 7T scanners that allow for pTx acquisitions and new 3T or 7T scanners entering the market that come with pTx capability. Despite the many benefits of slice accelerated multiband methods their optimal use at 3T and 7T is precluded by RF non uniformity and SAR constraints. The RF non uniformity will cause Signal to Noise Ratio SNR and image contrast to become spatially non uniform across the brain or other organ under scan. The elevated SAR as a result of imaging acceleration has been a limiting factor that prevents higher slice acceleration factors from being utilized especially when a spin echo type sequence is employed such as in diffusion MRI . This new technology demonstrates that when acquiring 7T HCP style diffusion and functional MRI using pTx MB pulses can produce better image quality and contrast than the state of the art HCP protocols relying on a single transmit configuration. For diffusion MRI because of the SAR reduction the use of pTx MB pulses can also double the slice acceleration MB4 vs MB2 holding great potential for reducing acquisition time or pursuing submillimeter spatial resolutions or both. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT Pilot scale demonstration. The new method has been developed implemented and demonstrated in humans. Its utility has been demonstrated by acquiring 7T Human Connectome Project HCP style diffusion and functional MRI using a commercial 8 transmit 32 receive RF coil and by comparing the results to those obtained with the HCP protocols. Given the observed large RF non uniformity at 3T the new method is also expected to have clear benefits for imaging at this more clinically relevant field strength. 
"High-voltage, Fully-integrated, High-density Microstimulator with Charge Balancing", A high voltage fully integrated neural stimulator chip for electrical microstimulation features a small chip area and high channel density. Using a feedback assisted current mirror structure with resource sharing and an efficient chip layout achieves simultaneous high voltage compliance high output impedance and high channel count. A foreground current calibration uses a single external capacitor to support the entire stimulation channels and an active charge balancing scheme uses a low resolution SAR ADC or comparator to monitor the residual voltage and adapts subsequent stimulation current and timing parameters. A current steering network allows one set of current drivers to support multiple non concurrent stimulation channels. The chip is designed in a high voltage process that allows up to 20V power supply and 19V output voltage compliance. A broad range of current mode stimulation waveforms and patterns can be generated including symmetrical asymmetrical biphasic monophasic and pulse train stimuli and the current amplitude pulse width and stimulation rate are all adjustable. Integrating two complementary charge balancing techniques reduces residual voltage and stimulation artifacts. The stimulator triggers neural spikes modulates neuronal firing rates and alters mesoscopic neuronal activity and can support a wide variety of neuroscience applications requiring electrical microstimulation. Previous stimulator designs that achieve high voltage compliance and high output impedance are unsuitable for implantable devices due to bulky design low channel count and high power consumption. System on chip SoC stimulators that employ feedback assisted current mirror structure and high voltage processes require a large chip area while off chip DC blocking capacitors suffer from poor channel density and are difficult to integrate into large scale stimulator implants. High channel stimulator SoC are feasible but because these designs often trade channel density for performance and lack mechanisms to actively monitor residual charge and ensure charge balancing they are not suitable for acute microstimulation applications. This new microstimulator chip presents a fully integrated stimulator with high voltage compliance high output impedance built in foreground and active charge balancing. The design achieves a good trade off between high performance and channel density due to adequate resource sharing and efficient chip layout. The smaller and more efficient design is scalable and retains the small chip area and high channel density needed for integration into biomedical implants particularly large scale implantable devices with hundreds to thousands of stimulation channels on a millimeter sized chip area. 
Neural Recording under Electrical Microstimulation, A miniature system on a chip SoC device enables continuous full duplex neural recording with simultaneous electrical microstimulation. The technology enables precise closed loop neuromodulation based on direct neuronal feedback. Scalable and with a small chip area and high channel density this new design could suppress electrode noise and support high impedance electrodes especially important to ultra large scale recording. The device can be used for a wide spectrum of neurological diseases through closed loop neuromodulation. Current electrical stimulation and recording technologies are not able to talk to the brain and hear from the brain at the same time. Electrical stimulation has been used for probing neural circuitry and identifying networks of neurons for many years but investigating and understanding the behavior of neural populations under electrical stimulation requires simultaneously monitoring neural activity which has not been possible until now. Furthermore current technologies suffer from limitations of scalability as well as poor signal quality artifacts and noise prone to misinterpretation. This device is the first technology that allows bidirectional communication with a brain and nervous system and features improvements in power noise resolution size weight scale and functionality. Phase of Development Working prototype beta tested in vitro in vivo data available. 
Improved Deep Brain Stimulation Target Selectivity, Target selectivity of neuromodulation e.g. deep brain stimulation DBS therapy is critical as the precise locus and pattern of the stimulation dictates the degree to which desired treatment responses are achieved and adverse side effects are avoided. A new concept for neuromodulation generates orientation selective and rotating electric fields that provide more precise and efficient stimulation thus reducing side effects. These strategies identify a new course for selective neuromodulation paradigms. The new electrode uses shaped pulses and phase modulation of current to more selectively control the orientation of the field s gradients relative to axons parallel orientation for maximum stimulation and provides power efficient neuromodulation. DBS while an effective treatment of various neurological and psychological disorders still has important side effects e.g. potential tissue damage due to non selective stimulation. Standard neuromodulation systems control just the amplitude and frequency of the stimulus that drives each individual contact of the multichannel lead thus the orientations of the electromagnetic stimulation is not controlled. This constant shape and frequency modulation limits the volume of neurons that can be consistently stimulated. In addition neurons can adapt to continuous stimulation resulting in diminished neuronal response and lessening neuromodulation efficacy. The novel electrode design provides more precise and efficient simulation by using orientation selective and rotating electric fields where shaped pulses and phase modulation of the current more selectively control orientation of the field relative to axons parallel orientation allows maximal stimulation . This new more flexible approach allows selective tuning of the excitation to the relevant population of neurons or axons eliminating tissue damage from excessive heat production and eddy currents and offering a controllable strategy easily adapted to avoid seizures and other side effects such as heat damage . Furthermore the new electrode design features geometric configurations that further improve performance. Phase of Development Proof of Concept demonstrated 
Deep Brain Stimulation Using Magnetic Brain Array, A first ever magnetic brain array can modulate stimulate neuron cells and other biological components sensitive to magnetic fields. The array offers low energy consumption and high density and consists of magnetic tunneling junction MTJ sensors for 3D mapping with potential for closed loop operation. The technique generates magnetic fields for biomedical applications by rotating a magnetic layer in an MTJ and using electrical current and or light to modulate the magnetic status of the magnetic nanostructures. The magnetic nanostructure stimulation array is integrated with a magnetic sensor mapping array into one chip for simultaneous mapping. Current electrical based stimulation devices have limited ability to steer stimulation to highly targeted locations. Moreover the simulation points must be in direct contact with the targeted tissue. This new magnetic array offers more precise stimulations of the intended target thereby reducing stimulation induced side effects. It features an array of magnetic not electrical nanowires in which localized magnetic stimulation is generated to provide non contact stimulation. Compared to state of art electrode based neuron modulation array this new array reduces power requirements offers higher density arrays than standard electrical based DBS and delivers more precise stimulation. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Phase of Development Prototype development 
Deep Brain Stimulation Settings Optimization Algorithm, A unique algorithm quickly and accurately determines optimal stimulation settings for deep brain stimulation DBS electrode arrays. The algorithm generates a patient specific grid representing a target tissue to be activated by compiling brain geometry and lead specific geometry data. It then determines a maximum activation function value for each point on the grid and uses an optimization method to calculate optimal stimulation settings for each electrode on the DBS array. By steering current through a deep brain stimulation array DBSA clinicians may be able to more effectively treat symptoms of Parkinson s disease essential tremor dystonia severe obsessive compulsive disorder and other neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Standard DBS leads which effectively treat disorders like Parkinson s disease and essential tremor consist of only four electrodes. A DBSA however may a higher number of electrodes arranged along and around one or more DBS leads. While having more electrodes vastly increases current steering capability it also presents new programming challenges. Conventional programming methods using clinical exams are often tedious and long in duration and do not take the unique structure of a patient s brain tissue into account. Other computational modeling approaches require vast computational resources that a clinical setting may not have. This new optimization algorithm surpasses these obstacles by providing quick patient specific stimulation settings and recognizing that therapeutic hot spots may differ from patient to patient.

Noninvasive Early Alzheimer’s Detection Imaging System, An imaging device based on the variable near infrared VNIR Hyperspectral Imaging HSI system can be used for early detection of Alzheimer s disease AD . The device combines conventional imaging with spectrophotometry to create pixel level spectral quantification of a sample. The HSI system is non invasive imaging samples are obtained through a simple retinal scan that doesn t require any dyes or additional reagents. Prior to cognitive symptoms of AD plaques form in the brain from amyloid beta A peptides an event known as A aggregation. In vitro assessment with this new imaging system detected cellular cytoplasmic changes before A aggregation. In mouse tests AD was detected 25 sooner than visible plaque formation. This is the only existing diagnostic method that can detect AD before A plaque formation. This diagnostic approach may be critical to new compound development and commercialization to halt and reverse disease progression. The efficacy of current AD treatments is severely limited by the lack of an early diagnostic method. Presently patients can only be diagnosed with AD after visible plaques have formed in their brains. At this point treatments can only slow down the inevitable progression of cognitive symptoms. With the new HSI system a physician could make an AD diagnosis long before visible plaques formed in the patient s brain. This would enable the patient to begin treatment significantly sooner improving their prognosis. Additionally the HSI system could be used to determine the success of AD treatments by measuring cellular changes and levels of A aggregation. This would enable physicians to fine tune treatments to better suit the patient s needs. BENEFITS AND FEATURES OF EARLY ALZHEIMER S DETECTION IMAGING SYSTEM Phase of Development In vitro assessment data and in vivo efficacy data is available now 
An approach to identify allosteric modulators of kinases, 16 619 798 The AGC kinase superfamily contains 60 family members that are involved in a variety of biological functions. Some well known family members are cAMP dependent protein kinase 1 PKA and cGMP dependent protein kinase PKC . Many AGC kinases are involved in diseases such as cancer and diabetes making these proteins a tempting target for therapeutics. However due to the large structural conservation between AGC kinases it is difficult to design inhibitors that are specific to one kinase without affecting multiple family members. In an effort to overcome this challenge researchers at the University of Minnesota developed a novel platform for the identification of allosteric small molecule substrate kinase inhibitors. This technology utilizes a small protein based sensor that detects specific interactions between AGC kinases and specific substrates. A kinase and a substrate of interest are connected through a protein linker flanked by a FRET donor and a FRET acceptor. Through the fluorophores the sensor reports interaction strength between the AGC kinase and the substrate of interest. Requiring very little protein reagent this technology is the first assay with the ability to detect allosteric changes in substrate kinase interaction. With a convertible format a small amount of reagents and the ability to detect small changes in kinases and substrate interactions this technology will provide a useful platform in the development of kinase based therapeutics. In vitro assays carried out with a number of disease relevant AGC kinases validating the use of this technology to identify substrate selective small molecule allosteric modulators.

Reduce contamination from grains and powdered food , Microbial contamination of grains powdered food ingredients and read to eat food products can result in serious illness upon consumption. Therefore food manufacturers are required to implement pasteurization procedures to decontaminate their products before packaging. In addition recalls of food are expensive and can damage manufacturers reputations. Using traditional thermal methods such as hot air or steam can change the quality of food and are not suitable for pasteurization of flour or other powdered or particulated foods. In addition poor heat transfer properties render this process inefficient. Non thermal treatment methods such as X rays and UV light on the other hand can cause significant chemical and physical damage to the food. Therefore an efficient and effective food pasteurization method with minimum quality changes is needed. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel method for pasteurization of food using intense pulsed light and low temperature microwave technology along with a photocatalyst and a microwave absorbent to effectively decontaminate granular or powdered food and food ingredients while using low energy. This process has been shown to reduce the microbial count in wheat kernels by over 3 5 logs in less than 30 seconds. As the product temperature during processing is maintained under 60 C no or minimal change in food quality is seen. In addition this process is directly applicable to powdered or particulated foods such as wheat flour non fat dry milk NFDM spices wheat kernels etc. Researchers have tested the effectiveness of this process by inactivating a variety of microbial contaminants such as C. sakazakii E. faecium B. cereus that are commonly found in food. This technology is now available for license The University is excited to partner with industry to see this innovation reach its potential. Please contact Larry Micek to share your business needs and your licensing interests in this technology. The license is for the sale manufacture or use of products claimed by the patents. 
"Cost Effective Preparation of Highly Stable, Reusable Whole Cell Biocatalysts", Whole cell biocatalysts offer several advantages over purified enzymes The main advantage is the elimination of costly enzyme purification steps. However whole cell biocatalysts suffer from inherent disadvantage of low reaction rates due to transport resistance imposed by the cell membrane. In addition limited working conditions predation and difficulties in separation of biocatalysts from the reaction mixture pose additional challenges. To tackle these problems Prof. Aksan and Prof. Wackett at the University of Minnesota have developed a method to create a microbial exoskeleton that enhances the overall performance and stability of whole cell biocatalysts. This technology presents a method to construct an exoskeleton using layer by layer deposition of inorganic material on the membrane of the whole cell biocatalysts. This encapsulation technique has been shown to Proof of concept. Enzymatic activity storage stability confirmed. This technology is now available for license The university is excited to partner with industry to see this innovation reach its potential.

Skin Care Formulations for Preventing and Treating Skin Cancer, A portfolio of three skin care formulations aims to prevent and even treat skin cancer. The portfolio consists of a base lotion a sunblock lotion and a pharmaceutical skin cancer treatment. Moisturizing creams cosmetics and other topical home care products may contribute to increasing non melanoma skin cancers NMSC and or melanoma in humans. While moisturizing creams and ointments are generally tested for irritant activity and effects on sensitization these skin care preparations are generally not tested for carcinogenic activity per se nor for tumor promoting activity. The marked increase in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cSCC every year suggests that commercially available sunscreens either are not being used appropriately or simply don't work. This portfolio of skin care formulations shows proven effectiveness based on solid scientific evidence. In addition the pharmaceutical formulation completely blocks skin cancer development either before or after chronic sun exposure. No other existing product can make that claim. 
Biosynthetic Route to Serofendic Acid, A new biosynthetic pathway leads to synthesis of serofendic acid a potent neuroprotectant compound. The process begins by using a Streptomyces host bacteria to synthesize ent atiserenoic acid EAA a precursor molecule in synthesizing serofendic acid with high yields. Serofendic acid has been shown to be an effective neuroprotectant that protects various cell types neurons cardiomyocytes epithelial cells from reactive oxygen species that can cause apoptosis. Neuroprotectants may be able to treat diseases such as Parkinson s Alzheimer s ALS and Huntington s disease. This biosynthetic pathway opens up cost effective options for further research. Chemical synthesis of serofendic acid is too expensive for feasible commercialization and often requires 15 or more steps and results in less than 10 yield. Standard microbial organisms yeast and E. coli used in isolating other natural compounds don t work for serofendic acid. Therefore researchers are recreating pathways in microbial hosts such as Streptomyces which appear to have unique capabilities for making certain types of natural products. This new biosynthetic pathway offers both a shorter and higher yielding synthesis of serofendic acid. It is also much more cost effective than the typical purification methods from fetal calf serum. The process harnesses microbe pathways to make EAA in a more cost effective manner. In addition it may be used to create other natural products for pharmaceutical and agricultural products related molecules that weren t possible using yeast or E. coli. 
New Prodrugs for Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease, New derivatives of pseudo glutathione GSH can be used as prodrugs for potential Alzheimer s disease AD treatment and prevention. The prodrugs and salts convert to GSH in plasma and show increased stability in the gastrointestinal tract and plasma. The prodrugs have demonstrated working memory restoration in mouse models of Alzheimer s disease and also have potential acetaminophen toxicity benefits. Already a strong candidate for treating Alzheimer s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders GSH is now an even stronger contender in the form of these stable new derivatives and salts. Pseudo glutathione GSH an analog of an existing drug candidate has been shown to reduce amyloid induced neurotoxicity and prevent cognitive decline in Alzheimer s mouse models. These new orally bioavailable prodrugs act as sustained release form of GSH offering longer half life and better cell penetration. The prodrugs improve upon the metabolic stability solubility cell permeability bioavailability and plasma stability of GSH. 
Bacterial Histidine Kinase Inhibitor, New compounds inhibit activity of multiple bacterial histidine kinases HKs and hold potential as therapeutics or antibiotics. These scaffolds could provide valuable starting points for designing broadly effective HK inhibitors globally reducing bacterial signaling and ultimately developing a class of antibiotics with a new mechanism of action. HKs are one part of the bacterial two component systems TCSs the primary signaling pathways bacteria use to respond to their environment. The new antibacterial compounds attenuate these signaling pathways by broadly targeting the histidine kinase family they focus on the highly conserved ATP binding domains in TCSs. Because HKs are very specific to bacteria their inhibitors can target multiple types of bacteria while minimizing the possibility of human toxicity. Multi targeted therapy may also hinder drug resistance since concurrent mutation of several drug target encoding genes is unlikely. Bacteria have developed resistance to known antibiotics therefore novel therapeutics are needed to treat infections stemming from such antibiotic resistant bacteria. New therapeutics would ideally aim for novel targets in such a way that antibiotic resistance does not rapidly develop. These new compounds circumvent bacterial resistance by targeting bacterial histidine kinases a class of proteins not currently targeted with known drugs. 
Anti-obesity and Weight Control Drugs Target Melanocortin Receptor, Chimeric peptide molecules that potentially activate the melanocortin 4 receptor MC4R are derived from molecules that both activate and block the receptor. The chimeric molecules contain a group that activates MC4R and inserts it into a chemical structure that potently blocks MCR4. This novel chemical scaffold incorporates an activating sequence His DPhe Arg Trp into an antagonist octapeptide scaffold of AGRP to target MCR4 for molecular probes and potential anti obesity drugs. The melanocortin 4 receptor MCR4 is one of many signaling systems that control appetite and body weight. Some molecules activate MCR4 resulting in decreased food intake and other molecules block it resulting in increased food intake . Developing anti obesity drugs that target MCR4 has been a significant effort but existing compounds have led to negative off target effects such as increased blood pressure and erectile activity. By generating chimeric molecules derived from both activating and blocking molecules this new scaffold could generate compounds that activate MCR4 without the previously reported side effects. 
Nonsurgical Method for Restoring Tooth Enamel, A noninvasive technology can treat tooth decay at its earliest sign through remineralization of tooth enamel. This technology combines two nonsurgical methods polymer induced liquid precursors PILPs and elastin like recombinamers ELRs . These methods deliver a void filling organic substrate and supersaturated amorphous calcium phosphate ACP deep into the lesion. Early stage lesions e.g. white spot lesions PILP is used to form a liquid like amorphous calcium phosphate ACP that infiltrates into porous substrates and crystallizes to form hydroxyapatite nanocrystals. This process stops and reverses lesion progression. Larger enamel defects caries or erosion a combination of PILP and ELRs is used. ELRs are used first to fill in large voids gaps on the damaged enamel surface and then the PILP process infiltrates ACP into the ELR matrices and the interstitial spaces between the enamel rods. Traditionally dental caries are treated by removing affected enamel and replacing it with restorative materials while a wait and see approach is adopted for early lesions. This new technology treats lesioned teeth at first clinical sign thus stopping lesion progression and helping to avoid tooth excavation. And while a few remineralization regeneration products currently exist they have had little success. These products use unstabilized calcium and phosphate ions to remineralize prevent enamel lesions but can be ineffective due to the shallow penetration of these ions. In contrast this new technology offers a much deeper penetrating treatment. By delivering supersaturated liquid like ACP directly to the target site crystallization occurs below the surface of the tooth. In order to avoid the interference of saliva the PILP solution is placed in a container tray where the ACP can quickly remineralize enamel lesions. While PILP and ELRs have been used independently this technology uniquely uses them together to remineralize and restore the structure composition and mechanical properties as well as aesthetic appearance of intact enamel. 
Weight Management Drugs using Selective Melanocortin Ligands, New tetrapeptide amino acid compounds can be developed into weight management drugs to treat obesity or stimulate appetite in underweight patients. These structures bind to both the melanocortin 3 and melanocortin 4 receptors which are involved in appetite and weight control. They have a unique dual pharmacological profile simultaneously activating the melanocortin 3 receptor and blocking activation of the melanocortin 4 receptor. In addition a series of closely related new compounds called retro inverso isomers selectively block the activation of the melanocortin 3 receptor but neither activates nor blocks the melanocortin 4 receptor. While many signaling systems control appetite and body weight two melanocortin receptors are critical in controlling appetite and mediating weight. The melanocortin 4 receptor affects immediate satiety and the melanocortin 3 receptor affects long term energy needs and food consumption. Current anti obesity drugs targeting the melanocortin 4 receptor have a number of side effects including increased blood pressure. Evidence suggests that targeting the melanocortin 3 receptor would induce weight loss without increasing blood pressure. The new ligands activate the melanocortin 3 receptor addressing the problem of obesity and its comorbidities e.g. diabetes heart disease and hypertension while the ligands that block the activation of the malanocortin 4 receptor could induce an increase in appetites and address related diseases such as cachexia the general wasting due to chronic illnesses e.g. HIV AIDS some cancers . 
Solar UV-Induced Skin Cancer Inhibitor, ADA 07 is a novel potent T LAK cell originated protein kinase TOPK inhibitor that effectively suppresses solar ultraviolet SUV induced skin carcinogenesis. The novel compound 5 1s 3s adamantan 1 yl 3 hydroxyimino indolin 2 one directly inhibits TOPK an upstream activator of mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK cascades involved in inflammation DNA damage and tumor development. Testing shows ADA 07 is a promising chemopreventive or potential therapeutic agent against SUV induced skin carcinogenesis. T LAK cell originated protein kinase TOPK an oncogenic protein involved in various cellular functions is highly expressed in many cancers. While evidence suggests that inhibiting TOPK might be useful in cancer chemoprevention and treatment very few effective TOPK inhibitors have been discovered. Targeting SUV induced signaling could be an effective chemoprevention and chemotherapy strategy against skin cancer. ADA 07 is a T LAK cell originated protein kinase TOPK inhibitor that may prevent and treat SUV induced skin carcinogenesis by directly targeting inhibiting TOPK. 
Drug Delivery Device for Oral Topical Medicine, An intraoral device offers targeted drug delivery. The self contained apparatus which may or may not contain cartridges is placed in the mouth between the upper and lower teeth. When compressed the fluid chambers expel fluid through a nozzle onto the target surface i.e. posterior oropharyngeal surface and palatine tonsils . The device provides rapid targeted therapy for several conditions Topical and systemic medications currently exist on the market but none effectively or quickly deliver long lasting medications to their targeted area. For example current delivery mechanisms for throat sprays typically do not deliver effectively to the targeted area and do not guarantee repeatedly reliable dosing. Lozenges deliver a targeted topical therapy to an intended area but do not provide long lasting relief. Systemic products taken orally e.g. anti inflammatory NSAIDs ibuprofen can take up to 45 minutes to achieve relief. Current products do not address the most important three components rapid onset targeted therapy and long lasting relief but this new technology does. The intraoral device delivers a rapid onset targeted long lasting therapy for sore throats and other conditions.

Nucleic Acid Delivery to the Liver for Hemophilia and Lysosomal Storage Disease Treatment, Polymeric materials containing polymerized GNA ligands deliver nucleic acids to the liver with low cytotoxicity. A series of cationic diblock glycopolymers derived from N acetyl D galactosamine GNA target asialoglycoprotein ASGP receptors on hepatocytes in the liver. These easily produced polymers bind to nucleic acids to form nanoparticles that cells efficiently take up. This novel method of nucleic acid delivery to the liver has many therapeutic applications especially for hemophilia and several lysosomal storage diseases. Existing technologies for liver targeted delivery use either viral or lipid based materials which can be toxic. Using these polymerized GNA ligands demonstrates lower cytotoxicity than the existing viral or lipid based technologies. Furthermore this polymerized form of GNA ligands is novel until now GNA ligands have only been used in mono bi or triantennary structures. BENEFITS AND FEATURES APPLICATIONS Opportunities

{'Compounds with Combined Cancer Drug Scaffolds Inhibit Cancer Cell Proliferation at Nanomolar Concentrations': "Purdue University researchers have developed compounds that are anti-proliferative against multiple cancer cell types. Cancer results from genetic alterations that impose uncontrolled proliferation of cells. Therefore, developing molecules to debilitate cellular proliferation would prove an effective treatment for cancers. Purdue researchers optimized a synthetic method to quickly synthesize a library of compounds containing combined cancer drug scaffolds via a multi-component Povarov reaction. The researchers investigated the anti-proliferative effects of the compounds by a primary screen in the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cell line. Analogs of the most potent compounds were further tested against the NCI-60 cancer cell panel and exhibited anti-proliferative effects on melanoma, leukemia, breast, lung, and renal cancer cell lines with GI50 values at sub micromolar concentrations. These molecules are also promising because they have a high fraction of sp3 carbons increasing their drug like characteristics. The compounds' potency toward multiple cancer cell lines and drug like properties make them promising candidates for future therapeutic development.Advantages: -Combined Anti-Cancer Scaffold-Easily Synthesized Compounds-Increased Drug-Like CharacteristicsApplications: -Cancer Therapies-Cancer Relapse TherapiesRelated Publication:HSD1787, a Tetrahydro-3H-Pyrazolo[4,3-f]Quinoline Compound Synthesized via Povarov Reaction, Potently Inhibits Proliferation of Cancer Cell Lines at Nanomolar ConcentrationsACS Omega 2020, 5, 37, 23799-23807DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.0c03001", 'Targeting T Cells in Tumor Microenvironments through Immunotherapy': "Researchers at Purdue University have created a ligand-targeted drug for reprogramming the body's immune system to eliminate cancer. This targeting strategy introduces a new frontier in medicinal chemistry and cancer therapeutics. Currently, cancer cells rather than immune cells in the tumor microenvironment are studied to develop therapies for solid tumors. However, immunoinhibiting regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are abundant in tumor microenvironments, can have greater potential to regenerate anti-tumor immunity. The approach developed by Purdue University involves the reprogramming of Tregs using of a targeting molecule with specificity for Tregs that can deliver an attached inhibitory drug solely to Tregs. Uptake of this inhibitory drug by the tumor Tregs then blocks the Tregs immunosuppressive properties and thereby allows the patient's immune system to eradicate the tumor. By targeting the therapeutic drug in this manner, the immunoinhibiting function of Tregs can be silenced without changing the immune system elsewhere in the body.

Both methods lack the desired efficiency and effectivity to treat bone fractures.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a targeted bone anabolic agent capable of accelerated fracture healing. By using a construct that self-assembles into micelles, the technology targets bone fractures to a greater extent than healthy bone, releases drug under physiological conditions, and accelerates fracture healing. This technology utilizes a nontoxic acidic oligopeptide that increases accumulation of the drug in fractures, reduces the accumulation in healthy tissue, and uses a cleavable linker to extend the release of the drug in the fracture site, resulting in faster fracture healing.Advantages-Nontoxic acidic oligopeptide increases accumulation of the drug in fractures and decreases drug accumulation in healthy tissue.

Cancer cells express PD-L1, a cell surface protein that binds to PD-1 on T-cells, debilitating anti-cancer immunity.  Antibodies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction have proven to be a viable therapeutic strategy toward mitigating cancer growth but suffer from high production costs, limited administration techniques, and low therapeutic indices. To address these limitations, Purdue University researchers created a small molecule inhibitor of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction that specifically target PD-1 dimerization. The researchers developed the new molecule through robust computational modeling of publicly available PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory data. In homogenous time-resolved fluorescence binding assays the Purdue compound exhibited about 1.6 fold increased potency in inhibiting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction compared to a positive control molecule known from the patent literature (IC50 = 339.9 nM and 521.5 nM, respectively). Further medicinal chemistry optimization promises to increase potency and yield an excellent preclinical candidate for use in small molecule immune checkpoint blockade therapy.Advantages:-Increased Potency to PD-1/PD-L1 Interaction-Combined Scaffolds of BMS CompoundsPotential Applications:-Immune Checkpoint Blockade-Cancer Therapeutics Related Publication:Combined Molecular Graph Neural Network and Structural Docking Selects Potent Programmable Cell Death Protein 1/Programmable Death-Ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) Small Molecule InhibitorsPreprint available at chemrixiv.orgDOI: 10.26434/chemrxiv.12083907.v1', 'Weaponizing Ubiquitin to Target Ubiquitin-C Terminal Hydrolase L1': "Researchers at Purdue University have developed a ubiquitin protein mutant that will selectively bind Ubiquitin C-Terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) enzyme over all other deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) expressed in cells. The ubiquitination process involves adding the ubiquitin protein to substrate proteins. This protein conjugation event can have different cellular effects on the substrate protein depending on the location and length of the ubiquitin linkages. DUBs are proteins that are responsible for cleaving ubiquitin linkages to maintain ubiquitin levels in the cell. One such enzyme, UCHL1, is overexpressed in a multitude of aggressive cancers and is involved with neurological diseases like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. However, the specific role UCHL1 plays in these disease states remains enigmatic.  Researchers at Purdue University have developed a macromolecular ubiquitin mutant for probing UCHL1's activity in a cellular environment. This technology offers a novel approach to studying UCHL1's role in certain disease states by probing intracellular UCHL1 activity in real time, a feat that has not been accomplished with any deubiquitinating enzyme.

IPF is a lung disease that is characterized by rigidification of the lung resulting and a gradual loss in ability to mediate gas exchange leaving patients in a hypoxic state that increases gradually over the course of the disease. Current treatment options for IPF are only able to slow the rate of disease progression and none are able to reverse the existing fibrosis. With around 40,000 new cases of IPF diagnosed each year, a curative treatment option would be beneficial in treating IPF. Activated macrophages and activated fibroblasts are two cell types play a prominent from in IPF. Activated macrophages secrete signals that activate lung fibroblasts, the cells responsible for fibrotic tissue generation. Therefore, shutting down the activated macrophage secretion signals would provide a potential curative treatment option for IPF. Researchers at Purdue University have identified molecules that target Toll-like receptor 7 selectively on the macrophage surface to shut down signals secreted that activate fibroblasts. These molecules have been tested in histological and mouse models.Advantages:-Selective targeting of fibrotic macrophagesPotential Applications:-Reverse idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-Possible combination therapy with existing therapeutics', 'Water Soluble Human Calcitonin for Treatment of Osteoporosis and Calcium-related Disorders': "Researchers at Purdue University have developed a prodrug form of the peptide hormone, human calcitonin, to increase its effectiveness as an osteoporosis treatment. In humans, calcitonin is the hormone responsible for normal calcium homeostasis. When prescribed to osteoporosis patients, calcitonin inhibits bone resorption resulting in increased bone mass. Unfortunately, human calcitonin undergoes fibrillation in aqueous solution leading to reduced efficacy when used as a therapeutic. As a substitute, osteoporosis patients are prescribed salmon calcitonin which does not fibrillate as rapidly but suffers from low potency and immunotoxicity. To decrease the fibrillation propensity and increase the therapeutic benefit of human calcitonin, Purdue researchers phosphorylated specific amino acid residues. This modification's ability to inhibit fibril formation was validated in comparison to the unphosphorylated calcitonin through thioflavin T- fluorescence, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and circular dichroism. This prodrug approach will increase the therapeutic potential of human calcitonin, promising a more effective option to replace salmon calcitonin for osteoporosis and related disorders.Advantages:-Stable solution of human calcitonin-Higher potency than salmon calcitonin-Less toxicity than salmon calcitoninPotential Applications:-Drug Development-Osteoporosis Treatment-Hypercalcemia Treatment", 'Nanoparticle Chemotherapeutic Delivery System that Aids in Development of Antitumor Immunity': 'Researchers at Purdue University have developed a nanoparticle-based system for sustained release of chemotherapeutic drugs at low doses that leaves antitumor immune cells with full functionality. Chemotherapy has been a mainstay in cancer treatment because of the anti-proliferative effects it imposes on tumor cells. Several chemotherapeutic treatment options result in generation of cancer antigens that aid in the activation of the host’s antitumor immune response. Paradoxically, these treatment options also damage immune cells, diminishing their antitumor effect. In response to this shortcoming of traditional chemotherapies, Purdue’s researchers developed a system to deliver chemotherapeutics and keep immune cells healthy. Their nanoparticle delivery system also elicits an enhanced immunogenic response compared to other chemotherapeutic delivery options along with increasing the metabolic stability and tumor retention of chemotherapeutic drugs. The chemotherapeutic, carfilzomib, formulated with this delivery system showed consistently greater antitumor effects against two tumor types in a mouse model compared to the cyclodextrin-solubilized drug.Advantages-Sustained Release of Chemotherapeutic Drug-Enhanced Immune Response-Increased Drug Metabolic Stability Potential Applications-Chemotherapy-Cancer TreatmentRelated Publication:Sustained Delivery of Carfilzomib by Tannic Acid-Based Nanocapsules Helps Develop Antitumor ImmunityNano Lett. 2019, 19, 11, 8333-8341DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b04147Domain: Pharmaceuticals', 'Anti-bacterial Compounds to Treat Neisseria gonorrhoeae Infections': 'Purdue University researchers have identified a class of compounds for use in treating gonorrhea infection. Strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterial agent responsible for gonorrhea infections, resistant to most contemporarily used antibiotics are becoming more prevalent. This fact has made gonorrhea a national and international health crisis as health agencies around the world consider gonorrhea a serious threat. To make matters even worse, major pharmaceuticals companies often abandon antibiotics research projects due to non-profitability. Thus new compounds have to be identified to combat this gonorrhea superbug. \u200bResearchers at Purdue University identified a class of compounds that kill Neisseria gonorrhoeae cells.

The Purdue researchers' technology targets both the primary tumor and the metastatic sites with the goal of patients' increased survival.The Purdue technology is a gene therapy that delivers a protein conjugate combining a therapeutic cytokine suited for treating metastatic cancer with a peptide that specifically targets tumor tissue. This technology was tested in an ex vivo mouse model and showed 10-fold increase in binding to tumor cells relative to normal cells. Expression of this conjugate in a mouse model displays an 89 percent decrease in prostate tumor growth rate relative to the control. In addition, the researchers observed upregulation of genes associated with immune cell trafficking suggesting delivery of this conjugate has a beneficial impact on both targeted cells and neighboring cells at metastatic sites.Advantages:-Designed for Advanced Stage Cancer Treatment-Targeted to Tumor Cells-Enhances Expression of Immunogenic GenesPotential Applications:-Prostate Cancer-Metastatic Control-Bone RepairRelated Publication:Ligand-Mediated Targeting of Cytokine Interleukin-27 Enhances Its Bioactivity In VivoMol Ther Methods Clin Dev. 2020;17:739-751doi:10.1016/j.omtm.2020.03.022", 'Novel Adenylyl Cyclase 1 Inhibitors for Treatment of Chronic Pain': 'Researchers at Purdue University have synthesized compounds to treat chronic pain by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1), an effector of the opioid receptor.

The Purdue researchers have identified compounds that potently and selectively inhibit AC1, the enzyme responsible for that overproduction of cAMP in neurons. The most selective compound displays 150x selectivity for AC1 over AC8, a homologous enzyme. These AC1-selective compounds provide a novel treatment option for pain.

Traditional administrations of antibiotics happen through oral or intravenous methods. These two methods in many causes are not effective for treatment of lower respiratory infections because drugs cannot reach infections sites in the airway surfaces. Furthermore, oral or intravenous medicines have problems with synergy of more than two antibiotics because different drugs have different behaviors. This means the drugs will arrive at the infections site at different times. This leads to compromised antimicrobial activity and potential development of antimicrobial resistance. There is a need for a new technology that allows for a more efficient way to deliver these antibiotics to the infected areas in the airways for treatment of deadly lung infections.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that solves the compromised antimicrobial efficacy with traditional oral or intravenous administrations. This new technology incorporates two or more synergistic components into a single particle which allows for simultaneous delivery with high efficiency to the infection area in the lungs. This maximizes the antimicrobial activity and minimize resistance development. There is also reduced local toxicity because of this technology. The addition of one component will improve the delivery efficiency and stabilize the other component. This new technology could open the door for much better therapies for treatment of dangerous lung infections.

Humans generate specific red and white blood cell types from a common precursor, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). HSC transplantation is an important therapeutic option for many blood diseases, cancers and immunodeficiencies, replacing diseased blood cell populations. However, HSCs are currently in short supply as they are typically extracted from humans. The Purdue University researchers have responded to this need by developing a serum-free, in vitro directed differentiation protocol to generate human HSCs from pluripotent stem cells. These HSCs have been proven capable of generating white and red blood cell progeny. In further validation of this technology, the HSCs implanted into zebrafish embryos colonized the hematopotietic tissues of the growing chimeric fish.

The World Health Organization recognizes antimicrobial resistance as a current global threat that has an economic impact of about three times the direct healthcare expenditures or about 1 percent of Gross Domestic Product. The growing risks of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, especially antibiotic resistant bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, necessitate the development of a new generation of antibiotics. Posing an additional challenge to drug design, many bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella, Listeria, and Brucella, also have the ability to inhabit human cells, often macrophages.Purdue University researchers have developed a broad-spectrum antibiotic that effectively enters human cells. This synthetic, proline-rich antimicrobial peptide has proven to kill a number of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including MRSA. This peptide effectively invades macrophages and exhibits strong intracellular activity while causing no damage to red blood cells as compared to most antimicrobial peptides.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 33 percent of hospital mortality in the United States is due to sepsis, a disease that occurs when bacterial endotoxins circulate in the bloodstream and trigger the immune system to attack the body. Available treatments largely rely on targeting the bacteria or providing life support, none of which directly clear endotoxins. Others have proposed treatments based on different nanoparticle systems; however, those technologies are not suitable for systemic treatment and would require invasive techniques of  extracorporeal blood cleansing. Purdue researchers designed a new solution to sepsis, which can be administered systemically and safely. In mouse models of sepsis, 100 percent of the animals treated with the new nanoparticle system survived while none of the animals in the control group survived.

The researchers were motivated to develop 20S CP stimulators as a pharmaceutical intervention to degrade the damaged and disordered proteins associated with a variety of disease states including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The hit compound discovered by Purdue's researchers stimulates catalytic activity of the 20S CP. This stimulator molecule increased the degradation of a peptide probe as well as several full-length proteins by the 20S CP versus a control without the stimulator.

Administering an inappropriate dose can be serious and result in adverse drug reactions, sub-par therapeutic effect, or even death. One such drug that has a critical need to be dosed appropriately to achieve a therapeutic effect is insulin for the treatment of Diabetes, given with injections. Conventional syringes have a hollow barrel and a solid plunger that is used to push fluid through the tip. Since insulin is dosed in small volumes and the barrels are narrow, it is difficult for patients to handle the syringe and read markings appropriately, which can cause multiple potentially fatal mix-ups. Thus, there is an unmet need for syringes to allow safe and reliable administration of a drug. Although programs and advertising campaigns are available to help educate patients about syringes with high concentration insulin, this has thus far not resulted in reliably accurate administration practices.At Purdue University, researchers have strived to overcome this problem and have developed a series of perimeter fill safety syringes. The syringe features a novel design that allows better accuracy and safety in the administration of concentrated doses of insulin. These syringes use a solid core. Fluid fills an area around the perimeter of the barrel. This smaller filling space provides a wider diameter for the barrel, thus increasing the visibility of the markings and allowing for better handling by the patient or health care provider. Another feature of this design is that the geometry improves safety during use, for example, designating rectangle shaped syringes for higher concentrations and the traditional cylindrical shape for lower concentrations. Additionally, these syringes have greater diameter that permits better grip, larger print, and easier manipulation. This technology can be applied not only to insulin administration but to medications of all types that are to be administered via a syringe. Hence, this would greatly reduce medication errors from the use of injectable syringes.

Treatment with the standard of care falls short; after treatment, patients' intestines become colonized by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The repurposed drug is capable of killing hypervirulent strains of C. diff, suppressing C. diff spore formation, preventing VRE colonization, and avoiding absorption from the intestine.

Two solid state forms are currently used commercially: thiamine chloride hydrochloride and thiamine mononitrate. The former is quite hygroscopic and is typically used in liquid formulations. The latter form is less hygroscopic, so is used in food powders. However, there is a public perception that nitrates are bad; hence, there is a potential market for alternative solid state forms of thiamine. Researchers at Purdue University have developed new solid state forms of thiamine through synthesis. These new forms are potentially less hygroscopic and are formed with more acceptable counterions. These thiamine solids help those in the food and nutraceutical industry who want to fortify foods and produce vitamin tablets. By adding thiamin forms that are chemically stable and acceptable to consumers, customers will be able to purchase products with better stability, longer shelf life, and will be able to consume more natural compounds unlike thiamine mononitrate or thiamine chloride hydrochloride.Advantages: -Better stability-Reduce degradation-More natural compoundsPotential Applications: -Food fortification-Vitamin tablets', 'Bactericidal and Bacteriostatic Agents against Drug-Resistant Bacteria': 'Researchers at Purdue University have developed novel antimicrobial agents to solve the continued problem of drug-resistant bacterial strains; approximately 20,000 people die in the US every year from drug-resistant infections.

CBX8 is a member of a family of highly homologous proteins with binding pockets that are difficult to target with traditional small molecules. For those reasons, current CBX inhibitors display weak affinity and poor selectivity. The current molecules also exhibit limited cellular permeability and toxicity to many normal cell types.

In contrast, current in vitro 3D cultures or "microtumors" typically yield cell aggregates less than 800 microns in size. Although these microtumors successfully mimic cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions observed in vivo, tumors in that size range are rarely detected in the clinic. Further, large engineered tumors produced by aggregation begin to die within a few hours. Larger, more stable in vitro models with clinically relevant architecture and cell phenotypes would be more relevant for testing drug delivery systems and other potential therapies. Bioprinting has been applied to the creation of large multicellular tumors that are reproducible and finely controllable; however, bioprinting requires high levels of expertise and access to expensive equipment. Using a simpler process, the Purdue researchers\' tumors remain viable for weeks and have traits relevant to the clinical phenotype, including a heterogeneous composition consisting of both preinvasive and invasive phenotypes and a structure allowing for adequate diffusion of nutrients both within the construct and to an exogenous extracellular matrix.Advantages: -Large tumors with clinically relevant phenotype-Tumors can survive several days (even weeks)-Does not require access to a bioprinter or training on how to use a bioprinterPotential Applications:-Evaluation of drug delivery systems or other proposed therapies', 'An optimized lyophilization process to minimize primary drying time': 'Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method to optimize the lyophilization process parameters in real time to minimize the primary drying time. The measurement of vapor pressure with wireless sensors reduces process variable uncertainty and enables accelerated drying times. The shelf temperature can also be controlled to reduce the difference in drying time between the center and edge vials, creating more consistent drying. Furthermore, this technology operates on any computing device that supports the Python language.Advantages: -Minimize primary drying time-More consistent dryingPotential Applications:-Lyophilization', 'Antibacterial Agents Effective Against Intracellular Pathogens': 'Researchers at Purdue University have developed therapeutics against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that penetrate through host cells and retain their antibiotic activity, effectively reducing the intracellular MRSA levels with no adverse effects on the host. Antibiotic resistance is a global problem accruing a cost of $20 billion in associated medical costs and taking the lives of 23,000 patients in the US each year. MRSA is a bacterial infection that commonly acquires resistance through infecting macrophages and other phagocytic host cells. Many antibiotics used to treat MRSA, including vancomycin, cannot penetrate through host cell membranes at lethal doses, thus leaving the MRSA infection free to proliferate in the intracellular compartment. The Purdue technology addresses this shortcoming of existing therapeutics while also addressing the need for a therapy that will not encourage bacterial resistance. Multiple strains of MRSA did not display any resistance characteristics when treated with these therapeutic molecules over time. Preliminary data indicate that these compounds exhibit decreased MRSA load in mice to the same degree as vancomycin. Additionally, these molecules underwent an Ames test and displayed no mutagenic characteristics. When screened at 10x MIC, they showed no toxicity to red blood cells in in vitro experiments. Initial mechanistic studies show these molecules reduce levels of bacterial DNA, RNA, and cell wall biosynthesis with similar or better potencies relative to antibiotics commonly used to reduce these macromolecules.Advantages:  -No adverse effects to host cells-No acquired bacterial resistancePotential applications:-Antimicrobial resistance-Antibiotic therapy-MRSA therapeuticRelated Publication:Inhibitors of Intracellular Gram-Positive Bacterial Growth Synthesized via Povarov–Doebner ReactionsACS Infect.

This devastating cancer is characterized by the heterogeneity of tumor antigens expressed on the surface of the tumor cells. This heterogeneity makes glioblastoma difficult to treat using mono-immunotherapeutic approaches, a treatment option that typically results in resistance to the therapy. Therefore there is a critical need to develop approaches to treat glioblastoma to overcome the heterogeneity of the disease. The technology developed consists of genetically-engineered natural killer (NK) cells and a small molecule inhibitor. The NK cells target two glioblastoma antigens while also blocking adenosine mediated immunosuppression to increase immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. Along with the cell therapy small molecule based autophagy inhibition promotes intra-tumoral NK cell infiltration, further increasing the effectiveness of the therapy. The genetic construct has been successfully expressed in NK cells as seen by flow cytometry analysis.  NK cells engineered with the construct display significant increases in the killing of a patient-derived glioblastoma cell line when compared to wild-type NK cells. This technology provides the first combination immunotherapy approach toward glioblastoma treatment providing the potential to drastically increase patient survival.Advantages:-Multi-Faceted Glioblastoma Treatment Option-Increases Immune Cell InfiltrationPotential applications:-Glioblastoma Therapy-Combination Therapy', 'Biomimetic Platform to Characterize Tissue Swelling': "Researchers at Purdue University have developed a biomimetic platform to quantify injection-induced tissue swelling. Administering biologics by subcutaneous injection is faster than by intravenous infusion and convenient for patients who can self-administer at home. However, the practice has not been broadly adopted, in part due to pain and discomfort from tissue swelling that occurs during an injection. There is currently no reliable platform to quantify tissue swelling for optimizing drug formulations. The Purdue researchers' platform enables prediction of mechanical stress and interstitial fluid pressure to optimize drug formulations with the goal of reducing pain and discomfort during subcutaneous injection.", 'Wireless Sensor Network for Enhanced Process Monitoring and Control of Lyophilization': 'Researchers at Purdue University have developed a sensor network that monitors chamber pressure and temperature and estimates the sublimation rate of a solvent during lyophilization. The technology enables optimizing drying in real time, and unlike other methods it is non-invasive, as it does not require temperature probes to be placed into the material. The sensor network is wireless and therefore can be integrated deep into the shelf.

To address the heterogeneity of cellular pathways in cancer, the source of a cancer's ability to become resistant to therapy, the investigators designed these molecules using a machine learning approach that targets the protein network implicated in the disease state to guide compound selection and synthesis. The series of compounds developed inhibits proliferation of C4-2 androgen-insensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cells with IC50 as low as 0.72 nM, and the compounds are much more potent than a control, the current steroidal CRPC drug, abiraterone (ABI). The most potent compound and other active leads were also more metabolically stable than ABI in a mouse liver microsome assay.

Adenosine immunosuppression is a regulatory mechanism of the immune system that protects against autoimmunity. However, this mechanism also drives cancers that express the enzyme, CD73. This enzyme produces adenosine, a molecule that inhibits immune cells. The Purdue technology circumvents this adenosine-mediated immunosuppression to treat cancer.Purdue's researchers engineered a type of immune cell, the natural killer (NK) cell, to target and kill cancer cells. The cells are engineered to express a protein consisting of an extracellular CD73 antibody fragment for targeting and an intracellular signaling domain that activates the NK cell to destroy the cancer cell. This potential therapy circumvents adenosine immunosuppression in the solid tumor microenvironment, selectively targeting cancer cells with engineered immune cells. The engineered NK cells have been successfully tested against glioblastoma cell lines and in vivo in lung carcinoma models, supporting this technology as a transformative cancer treatment to effectively target solid tumors.

To achieve minimal product loss, common practice is to optimize the recipe (time, temperature, and pressure) in each step of the lyophilization process, which wastes time unnecessarily. Purdue researchers have developed a technology that uses microwave assisted heating in place of conventional heating.

These acetazolamide analogs demonstrated a 2 to 4-log reduction in VRE gastrointestinal colonization in mice and were superior to linezolid, the current standard of care, in clearing VRE in internal organs. Additionally, they were shown to selectively target VRE without harming the normal gut microbiota.

Liposomal encapsulation of chemotherapeutic agents is widely used to reduce nonspecific side effects, because liposomes will preferentially target the tumor's leaky vasculature. Liposomes are typically loaded with drugs using pH gradients. However, some drugs, such as gemcitabine, a first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer, have proven difficult to load into liposomes with reasonable efficiency. In a proof-of-concept study using this new method, gemcitabine had a loading efficiency of 9.4 - 10.3 wt% compared to 0.14 - 3.8 wt% by conventional methods.

In an important cellular process that occurs within human and animal cells, proteins are degraded by the proteasome. As part of the molecular machinery of immune cells that have encountered inflammatory signals, a type of proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is a target of interest for autoimmune disease and cancer drug development. Current probes are not selective for iCP; they do not distinguish between this and other forms of the proteasome core particle. This new probe that fluoresces upon cleavage by iCP is efficient, selective, and can be used in live cells. Within 15 minutes of incubating the cell with 31 micromolar TBZ, iCP was detected in Ramos, SK-MEL-2, and A549 cell lines. At 31 micromolar, TBZ retains 3:1 selectivity for iCP versus the standard core particle.Advantages: -Selective towards iCP-Can be used in live cells-Higher fluorescence signal than commercial probePotential Applications: -Intracellular iCP pathway monitoring-Investigative protein expressionTags: Chemistry and Chemical Analysis, Pharmaceuticals, Fluorescent Dyes, Reagents, Research Tools, Proteasome, Immune, Drug Discovery', 'Low Cost Synthesis of Lomustine Under Continuous Flow Conditions': "Lomustine is a commercially available drug used to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma and brain tumors. According to Wall Street Journal, the price has increased over 1400 percent over the past 5 years which has made it unaffordable to many patients. The company currently selling Lomustine stated that one reason for the price hike is growing operational costs associated with the drug. Since lomustine has no generic competitors, there is a need for lower production cost of lomustine to make this treatment economical for patients.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a continuous manufacturing process for lomustine that has a short residence time and 63 percent yield. Major advantages of this process are that the total production cost for lomustine is lower, the product is higher quality, and the manufacturing operation is safer for production personnel.Advantages: -Control of purity-Continuous manufacturingPotential Applications: -Pharmaceutical manufacturing", ' New Target Identified for Cancer Therapy and Its Inhibitor': 'A major challenge in developing efficacious cancer therapies is the identification of target protein. Once a target is identified drugs can be developed and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the target. Recently through a collaboration with Scripps Research Institute and Purdue University, DNA polymerase epsilon subunit 3 (POLE3) has been identified as a target for cancer therapeutics. POLE3 combines with other enzymes to form a complex involved in DNA replication which occurs more frequently in cancerous cells than normal cells.Researchers at Purdue University have developed the first reported inhibitors of POLE3. The group of compounds that have been identified as POLE3 inhibitors are synthetic derivatives of beshanzuenone, a natural molecule from the Chinese fir tree. Beshanzuenone was previously reported to have activity against PTP1B, a target for diabetes II and obesity.

Inhalation therapy improves drug concentration on airway surfaces with reduced systemic exposure. Typically, the inhaled drug particles produced by the traditional jet-milling approach are highly cohesive and have poor flowability and aerosolization performance. Addition of excipients, such as lactose particles, may improve the aerosolization of cohesive powders; however, for high-dose drugs, like antibiotics, the addition of excipients may increase the inhalation powder mass that needs an excessive number of inhalations to complete the dose and a bulky inhaler to accommodate the large dose.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel inhalation formulation which shows superior antibacterial activity. Incorporation of this formulation is evidenced by an almost two-fold increase in aerosol delivery efficiency expressed as fine particle fraction. The synergistic antimicrobial activities and the increased aerosolization performance from this formulation will not only improve patient compliance by reducing the inhaled powder mass and minimizing local adverse effects, but will also have the potential to achieve superior therapeutic efficacy.Advantages: -Enhanced antimicrobial activity-Reduces inhaled powder mass-Minimizes local adverse effectsPotential Applications: -Dry powder inhalers-Respiratory infections-Antimicrobial therapy via inhalation', 'Enantiopure Synthesis of Alpha-Aminoboronic Acid Derivatives': 'Alpha-aminoboronic acids have been shown to possess anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, and anti-viral activity. This has resulted in increasing interest in developing alpha-aminoboronic acid derivatives for pharmaceutical application. However, this is difficult due to the nature of the chemical synthesis pathway. It is often desired to produce a specific enantiomer of alpha-aminoboronic acid because the activity of the molecule can differ between enantiomers. Unfortunately, there are limited number of synthesis pathways to produce enantiospecific derivatives.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a synthesis pathway to produce enantiopure N-substituted quaternary alpha-aminoboronic esters. This borylation pathway can be used for molecules with multiple chiral centers. Experiments showed that alpha-aminoboronic acid derivatives were able to be produced with 82 to 99 percent yield and over 99 percent enatiopurity.Advantages: -Enantiopure synthesis-High YieldPotential Applications: -Synthesis of alpha-aminoboronic acid derivatives-Borylation of molecules-Drug development', 'Anti-Angiogenesis Compound Targets Laminin Receptor in Cancer Cells\r\n': 'Laminin receptor (37/67 LR) is a membrane protein when over-expressed can promote metastasis of cancer cells. This is due to the ability of 37/67 LR to promote blood vessel formation in tumors in a process called angiogenesis. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is an endogenous protein that can bind to 37/67 LR to inhibit angiogenesis. PEDF is a viable therapy for cancer patients but due to it being an endogenous protein there are enzymes present in the body that degrade it. As well as, peptide formulation for drug delivery is difficult due to protein stability. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a small molecule that elicits a similar response as PEDF when it binds to 37/67 LR. Upon binding to 37/67 LR, the hit compound, C3, modulated an anti-angiogenesis pathway that inhibited prostate cancer cell viability, proliferation, and migration. Due to C3 being a small molecule, it did not bind to PEDF proteolytic enzymes, thus, bypassing PEDF degradation process which could result in longer duration of action. C3 is a promising hit compound which has potential for future development as a lead compound for prostate cancer treatment.Advantages: -Anti-tumor-Anti-angiogenesis-Bypass proteolytic degradationPotential Applications: -Prostate cancer therapy-ChemotherapyRelated Publication: Charles Samuel Umbaugh Et al., A dock derived compound against laminin receptor (37 LR) exhibits anti-cancer properties in a prostate cancer cell line modelOncotarget, 2018, Vol. 9, (No. 5), pp: 5958-5978', 'Next Generation Probiotic that Improves Gut Health and Provides Protection against Enteric Pathogens': 'Listeria monocytogenes is an opportunistic human foodborne pathogen responsible for severe systemic infection (listeriosis) which can lead to stillborn and premature births, as well as mortality in newborns, the elderly, and other immunocompromised individuals.

Currently, there is no probiotic based protection against the Listeria monoctyogenes infection available.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a next generation probiotic bacteria that binds to intestinal epithelial cells with high affinity to the receptor protein Hsp60 on the intestinal surface. This reduces inflammatory response and prevents Listeria monocytogenes from entering the intestinal epithelial cell barrier. This probiotic bacterium improves gut epithelial barrier integrity and helps protect against disease. The number of pathogens that crossed intestinal cells is reduced significantly.

NTMT1 is over-expressed in cancer patient tissues including the head and neck, colorectal, malignant melanoma, compared to normal tissue. Knockdown of NTMT1 promotes hypersensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) by etoposide and gamma irradiation. This knowledge has made NTMT1 an important anticancer target. Currently, there are no specific cell-potent probes available for NTMT1. There is a need for a new technology that can target the NTMT1 protein.Researchers at Purdue University have developed new potent inhibitors for the protein NTMT. The inhibitor exhibited high selectivity to NTMT1/2 over a panel of 41 methyltransferases. These chemical compounds are novel because they are amenable for cell-based studies. They may be further optimized for animal studies. This technology is more stable and cell-permeable than existing solutions.

The large enzyme complex known as the proteasome, specifically its subunit the 20S core particle (20S CP), can degrade proteins to then be recycled to make new proteins. Scientists hypothesize that chemically stimulating the 20S CP can degrade the disease-related proteins and serve as a treatment for protein accumulation disorders. The reporter molecule currently available to assay new compounds for 20S CP-stimulating activity produces a high level of background signal in the absence of any stimulators, making discovery of new 20S CP stimulators via high-throughput screening a challenge.Researchers at Purdue University have designed a new reporter molecule to detect stimulation of the 20S CP that is 3.5 times as sensitive as the current reporter. The sensitivity and effectiveness of this new FRET-based reporter was validated by screening 715 compounds for 20S CP stimulating activity. Four 20S CP stimulators were found in the screen, two of which were missed in a screen using the established reporter molecule. Related Publications:Rachel A. Coleman and Darci J.

These traditional MS/MS scans might require the sampling of multiple ion populations to answer structural questions. A method that could explore a 3-dimensional data domain following a single ion injection event would provide more options to explore the data space.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new methodology for operating a mass spectrometer that provides efficient routes from the large block of MS/MS data to answer particular structural questions. It is a major conceptual extension of MS/MS that allows experiments which explore the 3-dimensional data domain of MS/MS. Only data space relevant to the question is explored, minimizing time and ion utilization.

An FDA approved anti-overdose drug, naloxone, counteracts the action of opioids. Although naloxone's availability has improved in recent years with legislation allowing for over-the-counter purchase of the drug, patients often are incapacitated and unable to administer the potential life-saving drug on themselves in a timely manner. There is a need for a single-use anti-overdose drug delivery method that allows drug users to administer an antidote to combat the effects of an overdose. Researchers from Purdue University have developed an implantable drug delivery device that injects a single dose of naloxone or another anti-opioid overdose drug. The device will inject under the skin of at-risk patients of opioid misuse and activate upon detection of an overdose event. When an overdose occurs, the body reacts with a sudden increase in temperatures and other abrupt changes to normal body function. Such sudden changes trigger the implanted device, allowing the anti-opioid overdose drug to diffuse the overdose before lethal effects occur. The device will facilitate delivery of the antidote for caretakers or emergency responders. In future iterations, incorporating feedback control allows for the automatic release of the antidote upon overdose detection.

These methods are time consuming and costly. There is a need for a more efficient method of forced degradation.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new forced degradation method.  Using Leidenfrost droplets to accelerate forced degradation and nanospray mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize the reaction products, the reaction/analysis sequence provided results within minutes, i.e., five minutes, versus taking up to a week to complete.

HIV is a virus that weakens the immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. There is currently no cure for HIV, but it can be controlled. If HIV is not treated, the virus can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS usually occurs in the last stage of HIV when the development of cancer and other diseases take advantage of the weakened immune system.

In the 1940s, 95 percent of staphylococcus aureus could be controlled by penicillin, but that is now down to 10 percent (DailyMail.com). The CDC estimates that there are over 80,000 invasive MRSA infections annually, resulting in over 11,000 deaths. Even with the continuous development of new antibiotics to use against MRSA, bacterial resistance continues to grow. Phenylthiazoles have been examined as a new class of antibiotics, but its potential is hampered by poor pharmacokinetic profiles.Researchers at Purdue University have developed second generation Phenylthiazole antibiotics with enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. After synthesis, tuning, and proper treatment of the substances, one of the compounds showed significant improvement in in-vitro anti-MRSA potency. The rapid elimination of bacterial cells was achieved. This series has improved pharmacokinetic properties compared to the first generation with a better safety profile.Advantages:-Improved pharmacokinetic properties-Rapid elimination of bacterial cells-Significant improvement in in-vitro anti-MRSA potencyPotential Applications:-MRSA treatment-Treatment of other 'superbugs'-Antibiotic development", 'Improved Nanoparticle Based Targeted Drug Delivery to Cancerous Cells and Tissues': 'Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth. Currently there are more than 100 types of identified cancer that affect human beings as well as animals. In 2016, there were an estimated 1,685,210 new human cancer cases diagnosed and 595,690 cancer deaths in the United States alone (Cancer Statistics 2016 - American Cancer Society, Inc.). Nanoparticles (NPs) have been considered a promising carrier of chemotherapeutic drugs, but are limited in delivery to tumors due to the diverse nature of the disease. There currently exists the need to leverage the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deliver NPs beyond the current levels possible.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for preparing polyol-modified nanoparticles for targeted delivery to cancerous cells and tissues via transcytosis across the peritumoral endothelium. This method does not depend on the leakiness of the vasculature like traditional nanoparticle formulations, but actively interacts with the vascular lining to enter tumors.Advantages:-Increases the amount of drugs deliver to solid tumors-Reduces the required dose and related side effects-Does not depend on long-term circulation and passive extravasationPotential Applications:-Cancer treatment-Drug deliveryRelated Publication:Quinic Acid-Conjugated Nanoparticles Enhance Drug Delivery to Solid Tumors via Interactions with Endothelial SelectinsSmall 14 (50), 1803601DOI: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.201803601', 'Improved Drug Delivery Using Tough Hydrogel that Acts as a Synthetic Skin ': 'For many years, the achievement of continuous release of medication has been the focus of controlled drug release research. An on-demand control of drug delivery is desired in many clinical situations, as it promises to improve therapeutic efficacy and lessen side effects. Hydrogels are an ideal candidates given they respond to changes in the environment including pH, temperature, light, electric fields, and magnetic fields. Unfortunately, such triggers to do not transfer to clinical environments well. There is a need for improved methods of delivering pharmaceutical drugs to patients.Purdue University researchers have developed the use of tough multiple-network hydrogels for the reliable delivery of water-soluble drugs dissolve in this medium.  The dissolved drugs are released from the hydrogel in a controlled fashion, suppressing the initial burst release of drugs and providing a reliable mechanism to controllably release drugs into a local area.  Some of the hydrogels utilized have similar mechanical properties to skin.  This provides greater comfort for a patient and allows for utilization in difficult applications areas like joints, e.g., knees, elbows.Advantages:-Compatible with water-soluble drugs-Controlled delivery of drugs-Suppresses initial burse release of drugs-Allows for stretching to large deformations-Mechanically similar to skinPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical companies-Drug delivery-On-skin applications', 'Selective Ubiquitin Specific Protease Inhibitors for Treatment of Multiple Myeloma and Other Cancers': 'Multiple myeloma is a cancer formed by malignant plasma cells. Normal plasma cells found in bone marrow are an important part of the immune system (American Cancer Society). In 2017, the American Cancer Society estimates approximately 30,280 new multiple myeloma cases diagnosed in the United States with approximately 12,590 deaths expected. Current methods of treatment include immunomodulatory drugs, stem cell transplants, and proteasesome inhibitors. However, multiple myeloma remains incurable. Current treatment methods have issues with side effects and the potential for the development of resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of novel therapeutic agents.Researchers at Purdue University have uncovered a new set of molecules that selectively inhibit ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7) without affecting similar enzymes. Inhibition of USP7 is important for the treatment of multiple myeloma, as well as for other diseases characterized by aberrant ubiquitin-mediated processes, such as many cancer, inflammation, and immunological disorders. The molecules identified by Purdue researchers have broad potential for the development of therapeutics to treat cancer and other diseases.Advantages:-Selective inhibition-Targets key enzymesPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industry-Drug development-Treatment for cancer and other diseases', 'Adenoviral Vector-Based Influenza Vaccine': 'In the past, avian influenza H5N1, H7N7, and H9N2 viruses have infected humans, highlighting the ability of some avian subtypes to cross the species barrier. Such events can cause pandemic outbreaks of influenza by the emergence of an avian-human reassortant virus with the ability to spread rapidly in the human population.  Our current therapies have not been effective in abolishing the spread of these diseases. Pandemic influenza viruses, such as H5N1, are less immunogenic compared to epidemic influenza viruses, such as H1N1, and therefore, subunit or inactivated whole virus vaccines for H5N1 do not provide effective protection.  Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel strategy for combating influenza by using an adenoviral vector-based vaccine delivery system. Adenoviral vectors are known to activate innate immunity and can be administered via the mucosal or parenteral route, resulting in a strong immune rejection response. This novel method has been shown to provide effective protection against a lethal challenge with a pathogenic influenza virus. These vaccine strategies can be easily adapted to either pandemic or epidemic influenza viruses and provide effective protection to the population. Advantages:-Provides an effective vaccine for pandemic or epidemic influenza-Easily mass-produce large quantities of vaccine in a timely mannerPotential Applications:-Vaccines', 'Novel Immunocompetent Breast Cancer Mouse Model': 'Various monoclonal antibody-based treatments for breast cancer exist at different stages of development. Present technologies utilize the nude mouse model of breast cancer, which is not a true reflection of what may occur in normal animals in response to such treatments. Purdue University researchers found the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 is over-expressed in breast cancer cells, and therefore, provides a unique target for breast cancer intervention. An immunocompetent mouse model of breast cancer has been developed for evaluating various therapeutic approaches including those involving activation or inhibition of EphA2.Advantages:-Improved mouse model of breast cancerPotential Applications:-Drug development-Therapy evaluation', "Novel Conformationally Constrained Memapsin 2 Inhibitors for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease": "The processing of a precursor protein by memapsin 2 (beta-secretase, BACE 1) is the first step in the pathway leading to the production of Alzheimer's disease-causing amyloid-beta; thus, it is a major target for the development of inhibitor drugs used in the treatment of this disease.  A Purdue University researcher has designed a series of novel memapsin 2 inhibitors that incorporate conformationally constrained cyclic amine derivatives in place of conventional hydroxyethylamine isostere-derived inhibitors.  These inhibitors' design improves pharmacological properties of drug forms, improving metabolic stability, oral bioavailability, and in vivo A-reductions. \tAdvantages:-Improved pharmacological propertiesPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical industry", 'Potent HIV Protease Inhibitor Against HIV/AIDS': "HIV-1 protease inhibitors are the key component of current antiretroviral treatment (ART) of HIV infection and AIDS. The majority of today's FDA approved protease inhibitors do not show efficacy because of the emergence of drug resistance. Darunavir, a leading protease inhibitor drug, is widely used for the treatment of patients harboring drug-resistant HIV variants. However, after long-term use, darunavir-resistant HIV-1 variants are emerging and there are very limited options to treat these patients.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new class of inhibitors that have shown exceptional potency against multidrug resistant (MDR) HIV-1 variants. The developed compounds are novel and show better drug-resistant properties.Advantages:-Fight drug-resistant HIV-1 variants-New compounds show better drug-resistant propertiesPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industry-HIV/AIDS treatment", 'Top1/TDP1/TDP2 Triple Inhibitor Anticancer Agents': 'In 2016, the American Cancer Society estimated 1,685,210 new cancer cases diagnosed and 595,690 cancer deaths in the U.S.  There is a great need for the development of new therapies for cancer treatment.  Currently, topoisomerase 1 (Top1) inhibitors are used as anticancer agents.  DNA damage caused by topoisomerase 1 inhibitors needs to be repaired in order to prevent the death of tumor cells.  Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 and 2 (TDP1 and TDP2) can repair damaged DNA resulting from Top1 inhibitors and a variety of other DNA-damaging agents.  Triple inhibitors of Top1, TDP1, and TDP2 are therefore able to damage the DNA of cancer cells and also prevent its repair, thereby causing cancer cell death.Purdue University researchers have developed a series of azaindenoisoquinoline compounds that act as inhibitors of Top1, TDP1, and TDP2.  Molecular modeling of selected target compounds bound to Top1, TDP1, and TDP2 was used to design the inhibitors and facilitate the structure-activity relationship analysis. The resulting compounds act as triple inhibitors of Top1, TDP1, and TDP2, which increases anticancer activity.Advantages:-Triple inhibitors-Increases anticancer activityPotential Applications:-Cancer treatment-Radiation-Antiviral therapies', 'Completely Continuous Plug Flow Crystallization Process of Pharmaceutical Production': "Using a traditional plug flow crystallization method for the manufacture of an active pharmaceutical ingredient creates encrustation in the system, causing inefficient production. This encrustation blocks flow through the reactor resulting in an inconsistent product and necessitating frequent cleaning. Most importantly, the resulting pharmaceutical product will have inferior properties, resulting in inconsistent dosage in the patient. However, a perfected method of plug flow crystallization has the potential to increase manufacturing productivity and product quality. Researchers from Purdue University have developed a reactor system that eliminates encrustation in plug flow crystallization platforms used in pharmaceutical manufacturing. This system eliminates down time for reactor cleaning, increases product yield, and yields a more consistent product. The more consistent active pharmaceutical ingredients produced using this plug flow system will ultimately provide an optimum dose for the patient's best means of recovery. Advantages: -Efficient manufacturing -Higher production yield  -Allows for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing Potential Applications: -Drug manufacturing", 'Synthetic Lung Surfactant for Respiratory Distress Syndrome': "Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) causes nearly 40 percent of premature infant deaths worldwide. A lack of natural surfactant in their under-developed lungs is the initial cause of RDS. Treatment is not readily available for RDS in developing countries because conventional surfactant replacement therapy uses animal-derived surfactants that are costly to produce, must be carefully stored, and require highly trained practitioners to perform a sophisticated delivery procedure.Researchers from Purdue University have developed a synthetic polymer-based surfactant to treat RDS by supplementing the premature infant's naturally produced surfactants. The synthetic lung surfactant, proven effective by in vitro measurements using a lung-mimetic device, will be less expensive to produce and store and will not require delivery by skilled physicians. This simple, cost effective surfactant is a promising treatment to decrease the mortality rate of premature infants worldwide.Advantages: -Less costly to produce and store-Less variation in production versus current animal-derived surfactant-Treatment option for developing countries Potential Applications: -Respiratory distress syndrome", 'Simulating the Powder Properties of a 3D Roll Compactor': 'Powder roll compaction is a processing technique used in many industries to compress a fine powder into larger granules. The larger particles are generally easier to process than the fine powder, but their density and size must be consistent. Researchers at Purdue University have developed models for Abaqus, a software suite for finite element analysis and computer-aided engineering, which simulate the powder properties of a 3D roll compactor. The models predict the roll force, roll torque, and roller-compacted ribbon density distribution. Better simulations allow for control over the uniform density of the granulated powder.Advantages:-Increases uniform density of granulated powder-Predicts the roll force, torque, and compacted ribbon density distributionPotential Applications:-Drug production-Food processing', "Cellular Model of Parkinson's Disease": "Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is central in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Converging evidence suggests that the level of aSyn expression plays a critical role in both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease. The study of aSyn toxicity remains critical because the manner in which aberrant aSyn leads to neuronal degeneration is not yet understood. Current methods of monitoring aSyn toxicity levels in cell culture require inducing cellular differentiation, a process that is time-consuming, costly, and highly susceptible to variations in experimental conditions from one lab to another. Additionally, the current cellular model is insensitive to the toxic effects of aSyn, making it very difficult to monitor the effect of treatment on aSyn toxicity.Purdue University researchers have developed an assay to address these challenges that uses an undifferentiated immortalized cell line that expresses aSyn at high levels. Importantly, aSyn is thought to carry out its neurotoxic effect in part by disrupting mitochondrial function; the new assay takes advantage of cell culture conditions to ensure that cells retain functional mitochondria. As a result, this assay displays pronounced aSyn toxicity enabling more robust measurement of a treatment's effect on toxicity. Because this assay does not require differentiation of the cell line, it is also more reproducible and less time-consuming.Advantages: -Less costly -Faster-Less susceptible to variation Potential Applications: -Screening assay for Parkinson's disease drug discovery-Interrogation of Parkinson's disease biology", 'Direct Contact Blood Brain Barrier Triculture': 'Neurological disorders have been steadily increasing over the last several decades. While drug discovery and development efforts to mitigate these diseases have concurrently increased to meet the change in prevalence, clinical translation into marketed products have been hindered. One of the main difficulties in creating this translation is the lack of a model that can predict the ability of new chemical entities to permeate through the brain blood barrier (BBB). Current models suffer from leakiness of the in vitro cellular tight junctions and that leakiness leads researchers to overestimate the amount of drug permeation.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a model that represents a more restrictive, accurate model of the BBB. This model is a direct contact, triculture model containing astrocytes, pericytes, and the brain microvessel endothelial cells (BMEC) configured in a physiologically similar manner to an in vivo BBB. This method allows for direct contact between the pericytes and the astrocytes and measures the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) as an indirect measure of cell tightness.  Researchers monitor the TEER until they determine a window in which a triculture would be of utility for permeability studies. This model will offer superior selectivity for screening neuroactive or neurotoxicant agents in vitro and help in the rational selection of candidates for advancement into further clinical studies based on its physiological similarity to the in vivo BBB cellular configuration. This model may also be adopted to select compounds that have a lower potential of eliciting a neurotoxicant effect.Advantages:-More accurate model representing the BBB-Allows materials to permeate through it-Allows for direct contact between the astrocytes and pericytesPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceuticals-Research & Development-Drug discovery', 'RNAi-Based Treatment for Chronic Liver Diseases': 'According to the 2010 National Hospital Discharge Survey as published by the CDC, over 101,000 patients in the United States were hospitalized due to chronic liver disease, including fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease, and liver cancer. In the same year, there were 36,427 deaths related to chronic liver disease. One of the strongest genetic risk factors for developing chronic liver disease is the I148M mutation of the PNPLA3 gene. In models, it was confirmed that reducing the 148M isoform resulted in reduced fat accumulation, which affects the development of fatty liver disease in humans. Reducing the expression of this 148M isoform is a promising mechanism for slowing or reversing the progression of chronic liver disease.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a small-interfering RNA (siRNA) that specifically targets the 148M isoform. This siRNA reduces the expression of 148M mRNA while having minimal effect on the 148I isoform. This siRNA shows promise as a therapy for fatty liver disease and other types of chronic liver disease.Advantages:-Targets the genetic mutation that causes chronic liver disease-Affects the responsible isoform with minimal other effects-Models have shown reduced fat accumulationPotential applications:-Therapy for chronic liver disease', 'Carrier-Free Nanoparticle Formulation with Good Circulation Stability': 'Nearly 40 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients under development are poorly soluble in aqueous media leading to low bioavailability and erratic absorption. In an attempt to solve this issue, researchers began to develop nanocrystals of these insoluble drugs. Nanocrystals have increased dissolution rates, offering increased solubility. However, fast-dissolving small nanocrystals provide little advantage to solution formulations, and larger nanocrystals are recognized by the immune system.  In addition, current nanoparticle formulations can contain greater than 50 percent excipients; the excipients often present their own adverse effects, which limit the dose.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method to produce pharmaceutical nanocrystals comprised of more than 85 percent of their respective active ingredients. These nanocrystals are coated with albumin to prevent the immune response and allow the nanocrystals to target cancerous cells unhindered. These nanocrystals have the potential to increase the effectiveness of a wide range of drugs as they contain a much greater percentage of active ingredients, allow for increased bioavailability, and avoid immune recognition.Advantages:-Increases bioavailability of insoluble drugs-Fewer adverse effects-Avoids immune recognitionPotential Applications:-Drug formulationRelated Publications:J.

AMP is a viable alternative for overcoming antibiotic resistance, which poses a serious threat to public health globally.  Naturally occurring AMPs are expensive and have limited availability.  Developing synthetic AMPs is also expensive given the extensive screening process of potential candidates and risk of toxicity.  There is a need for an inexpensive process that can identify naturally occurring AMPs.Purdue University researchers have developed a method to identify naturally occurring AMPs based on the physical characteristics of the peptide and the interactions of the peptides with a mixed phospholipid layer, which mimics bacterial cells, using molecular dynamics simulation. Compared to other research methods, this method is based on the physical characteristics of the compound rather than empirical and bioinformatics data. This research method was validated by the discovery of a peptide segment derived from soy protein with antimicrobial properties. Effects of the peptide were demonstrated against Gram-positive Listeria and Gram-negative E. coli. Characteristics of the soy peptide allow its use in a number of applications such as an antibiotic replacement to address antimicrobial resistance, a supplement to animal feed, and in antimicrobial packaging in food safety applications. In addition, this method can serve as a research tool for the discovery of more peptides with antimicrobial properties in the future.

Existing API production technologies are based on batch configurations and are not integrated, have a large footprint, and lack real-time process monitoring and control.  These issues, among many others, lead to variable product quality, high labor costs, and suboptimal use of raw materials and inventories.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology that is a continuous end-to-end pharmaceutical manufacturing platform (MiniPharm) using microfluidic and 3D printing and milling technologies for the robust and continuous manufacture of solid API. Using previously inaccessible flow chemistries, the MiniPharm is highly reproducible and controllable. The MiniPharm consists of a network of reconfigurable pharmaceutical unit operations with a specially sculpted microchamber. Each unit is designed to be a module that can be flexibly switched in and out depending on real-time medical demand.  Hence, the MiniPharm can be easily reconfigured and adapted to the specific requirement of each API production. These units are exceptionally scalable, requiring the addition of other modules in parallel to increase throughput. The modules also provide flexibility and agility for real-time product releases to overcome manufacturing challenges such as drug surplus and shortage. The MiniPharm is equipped with innovative anti-fouling control to address the interruption of operations due to fouling to which current pharmaceutical manufacturing processes are prone.

The more virulent strains include those resulting in widespread human infection and diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Human CoVs originate from a jump between species known as zoonotic shifts. As zoonotic shifts occur, the medical field does their best to create vaccines and therapeutics to combat these diseases. Vaccines exist for canine CoV, avian infectious bronchitis virus, and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis CoV; however, there is currently no treatment for human CoV infections.Researchers from Purdue University have developed a series of 48 peptidomimetic compounds as broad-spectrum inhibitors of the CoV 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Five compounds present themselves as successful inhibitors of all alpha- and beta-CoV CL3pro's tested, and 28 compounds inhibit at least one 3CLpro. In the past, the focus has been on developing vaccines that are specialized to one strand or class of virus. With the current developments, multiple strands of CoVs can be treated by administering the anti-CoV drug. These 3CLpro inhibitors hold promise as a much needed treatment for a number respiratory diseases cause by CoV that infect humans as a result of zoonotic shifts.Advantages:-Wider spectrum of use-Therapeutic treatmentPotential Applications:-Drug development-Viral disease research-Coronaviruses-Zoonotic diseases", 'Novel Aryl Isonitrile Antimicrobials Active Against Clinically Important Bacterial Strains': 'Antibiotics and infectious disease therapy made huge strides in the last century; however, the emergence of resistant strains and superbugs has increased. In the United States alone, 2 million people each year are affected by these infections, resulting in over 23,000 fatalities. Out of these, nearly half are caused by the pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and VRSA) cause a range of diseases including superficial skin infections, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and bloodstream infections. These strains have become resistant to nearly every class of antibiotics, including agents of last resort, such as vancomycin and linezolid.Researchers at Purdue University have identified a novel class of compounds that have an aryl isonitrile moiety that shows potent inhibitory activity against clinically important strains of MRSA and VRSA, Bacillus anthracis, and Listeria monocytogenes. These compounds demonstrate strong antimicrobial activity against MRSA strains that are resistant to numerous antibiotic classes such as penicillins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, lincosamides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. Not only are these compounds potent, they do not show any apparent toxicity against mammalian cells up to a concentration of 64 micrometers, compared to other antibiotics that have a narrow therapeutic to toxic concentration range. In addition, analysis implies that cross-resistance between other antibiotics and these aryl isonitrile compounds is unlikely. Hence, these compounds have the potential for use as future alternatives to other antibiotics for the treatment of resistant strains of MRSA and VRSA in clinical settings.

Chirality greatly influences a drug's biological and pharmacological properties. Advances in the synthesis of chiral tertiary alkyl-containing compounds have been made through the development of catalytic asymmetric alkene hydrogenation, epoxidation, and carboalumination. However, in cases where the initial enantiomeric excess of the crude product is low or where two groups around the chiral center are chemically similar, enantiomeric purification of the crudely obtained products is difficult and synthetically impractical. Purdue University researchers have developed a synthesis for tertiary 1-alkanols yielding greater than 99 percent enantiomeric purity. First, an alcohol is coupled to a branching group using the ZACA reagent. A subsequent purification method is then used to yield a product of greater than 99 percent enantiomeric excess. A wide range of enantiomerically pure compounds, including valuable biologically relevant isoprenoid and deoxypolypropionate natural products, can be synthesized using this strategy.Advantages: -Yields greater than 99 percent enantiomeric purity -Applicable to a wide range of compounds Potential Applications: -Synthesis of chiral 1-alkanols-Synthesis of natural products-derived pharmaceuticals", 'Peptoid Cancer Drugs Targeting PCNA Designed via a Novel in Silico/In Vitro Pipeline': 'Fragment-based drug discovery is a popular method used to design molecules that bind to protein targets. In this method, many small compounds are screened for their binding to a target protein. Subsequently, steps are undertaken to combine more than one of the small compounds found to bind weakly into a larger, stronger-binding, drug-like compound. Fragment-based drug discovery presents a significant challenge; information must be known about the binding sites of the fragments so that they can be combined in a way that does not disrupt the binding of the individual fragments. In addition, many important drug target proteins participate in protein-protein interactions. Disrupting such interactions is critical to disrupting the chemical signals that drive cancer and other diseases.To overcome the challenges of traditional fragment-based drug design, researchers at Purdue University used a combination of computational and experimental technique to discover novel inhibitors of the interaction between proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and a peptide that binds to a site on PCNA responsible for multiple protein-protein interactions relevant to its cellular function. Specifically, thousands of tripeptoids (peptide-like molecules with three chemically distinct sites) were screened in silico, facilitating the selection of a small number of tripeptoids for in vitro testing. Several of the selected tripeptoids show a good ability to disrupt the PCNA-peptide interaction. This method of drug discovery successfully identified a small number of hit compounds that disrupt a protein-protein interaction involving PCNA, an important cancer target.Advantages: -Potential first-in-class cancer drug-Fewer compounds synthesized -Less structural information needed than in traditional fragment-based drug discovery-Well-suited to targeting protein-protein interactionsPotential Applications: -Drug discovery-Cancer therapy', 'Aromatase Inhibitor Breast Cancer Therapeutics with Reduced Potential for Side Effects': "Aromatase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens, which is a crucial step in the biosynthesis of estrogens in the human body. Hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer cells are stimulated by estrogen; therefore, aromatase inhibitors (AI) have been widely used for treatment of this cancer in postmenopausal women. Despite the efficacy of AIs, these drugs have a variety of side effects including joint pain and susceptibility to bone fracture. More than 10 percent of patients discontinue AI therapy after six months due to musculoskeletal toxicity.To combat these side effects, researchers at Purdue University have developed a compound with dual activity as an aromatase inhibitor and selective estrogen receptor modulator. The compound's activity as a selective estrogen receptor modulator promises a way to avoid the undesired side effects.

As the number of medications available grows, it becomes difficult for the doctor, pharmacist, and patient to know which medications are resulting in adverse drug reactions and effects. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a screening system, Pharmaceutical Therapy Related Quality of Life (PTRQoL) instrument. The PTRQoL system is a set of questionnaires that identify adverse drug reactions and effects associated with the 200 most popular prescription drugs. The PTRQoL system could be used by patients at a computer kiosk while they wait for their prescriptions to be filled. When the pharmacist is counseling the patient, they can utilize the results of the questionnaire to identify and focus on existing issues the patient may be experiencing.

There is a deficiency of medications against resistant strains as more research is focusing on new drug discovery, which can be time-consuming, costly, and of high risk. In addition, it is difficult to get these medications to market due to strict FDA regulations. To find new solutions to this problem, a Purdue University researcher has developed a new method of drug repurposing, which helps to identify three drugs, auranofin, ebselen, and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd), as potent antimicrobial agents against Gram-positive pathogens such as MRSA. Although these drugs had other FDA approved indications, expanding their use to antimicrobial therapy would increase medication options for infections. Since these drugs are either FDA-approved drugs or clinically safe molecules that have an established pharmacokinetic and safety profile, it will significantly reduce the time and cost required to bring these drugs to clinical trials. Furthermore, they have greater oral bioavailability, potent bacterial killing activity, very low frequency of resistance, suppression of bacterial virulence factors and toxin production, potent anti-biofilm activity, and good penetration and killing of intracellular MRSA. These drugs can be used as antimicrobial medicines in hospitals and clinics for seriously ill patients with infections. This improvement in research also allows for the discovery of other drugs that can be repurposed and used as antimicrobials.

Unfortunately, compounds using ASDs have the potential to crystallize, changing from an amorphous solid to a crystalline solid over an indeterminate time. Before such a drug can be released, stability studies must be performed to determine the viability of the drug after extended time. This normally requires the compound to be subjected to months of elevated temperature and humidity. This expensive, time-consuming process often leads to major backups in the drug development process. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a simple, inexpensive method for the detection of trace crystallinity in pharmaceutical formulations. This new method uses the inherent ability of crystalline compounds to support triboluminescence. By transferring kinetic energy to the sample, trace amounts of crystals can be detected by measuring the optical radiation caused by the triboluminescence of the compound. This new method allows for trace crystallinity in new drugs to be quickly and accurately identified by a simple and relatively inexpensive test.

As a result, second harmonic generation (SHG) has emerged as a complementary technique for the rapid detection and quantification of trace crystallinity within pharmaceutical materials. Despite the low detection limits of SHG microscopy, the SHG intensity itself provides insufficient chemical information about the composition of the SHG-active source. There is unmet need to obtain such information.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method utilizing SHG microscopy to identify regions of interest for localized confocal Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements to quantify crystallinity and identify composition within formulations of pharmaceutical materials. By targeting the Raman and XRD analysis to these localized regions identified by SHG, the corresponding reduction in background, lowered the limits of detection for both Raman and XRD by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude relative to ensemble-averaged measurements. Targeted analysis by XRD and Raman spectroscopy were both consistent with crystalline paclitaxel comprising the insoluble particles. These combined results show the potential benefits provided by the marriage of the rapid and highly selective technique of SHG with information-rich methods such as Raman and XRD.Advantages:-Enable targeted analysis by Raman and XRD-Reduces the time required to perform the Raman measurements-Improvements in the detection limits for trace crystallinityPotential Applications:-SHG Microscopy -Spectroscopy-Synchrotron x-ray diffraction', 'Microfluid Platform to Screen Cancer Drug for Delivery': 'Developing and testing cancer drugs is an expensive process that requires, among other things, exhaustive in vivo animal experiments.

This innovative platform can mimic the complex transport processes inside a tumor, such as transvascular transport, interstitial transport, and transmembrane transport. These processes are all simulated on a single benchtop device, thus improving the repeatability and speed of testing, while reducing the cost and use of animals in drug discovery.Advantages:-Mimics multiple transport processes-Increased repeatability and speed for drug testing-Low costPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical industry-Drug development-Research labsRelated Publications:Bumsoo Han.

Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel method for stabilizing protein drugs based on ligand binding. The peptide epitopes are covalently linked to a biodegradable synthetic polymer, forming a pseudo-ligand. The pseudo-ligand binds to the protein drug with high affinity and helps to preserve near-native conformation, minimize unfolding, and prevent aggregation during manufacturing, shipping, and storage. Since the pseudo-ligand is comprised of a biodegradable polymer backbone and small peptide epitopes, it is expected to be biocompatible and nonimmunogenic. In some applications, it may be desirable to administer the protein drug in its free form. In such cases, the pseudo-ligand can be immobilized on a solid surface through a coupling agent and released prior to administration using a competing ligand.Advantages:-Preserves near-native conformation-Biocompatible and nonimmunogenicPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industryRelated Publications:Zhang, Jun, et al.

Site-specific delivery can optimize the therapeutic efficacy of many drugs with preferential absorption sites. Although many smart capsules have been developed that are suitable for drug absorption studies in clinical settings, they cannot be used for actual therapy in larger populations that can benefit from smart capsules, which releases the drug at an optimum location in the gastrointestinal tract. This is mainly due to the problems associated with the need for real-time tracking of the capsule location. In addition, all these systems require active participation by the patient/volunteer in the form of triggering the RF transmitter once the capsule is in the target position. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a smart capsule for location-specific drug release in the gastrointestinal tract. Once activated through a magnetic proximity fuse, the capsule opens and releases its powdered payload in a location specified by an implanted miniature magnetic marker or an externally worn larger magnet. The capsule (9 mm x 26 mm) has two compartments, one contains a charged capacitor and a reed switch, while the other houses the drug reservoir capped by a taut nylon thread intertwined with a nichrome wire. The nichrome wire is connected to the capacitor through the reed switch. The capacitor is charged to 2.7V before ingestion, and once within the proximity of the permanent magnet, the reed switch closes, discharging the capacitor through the nichrome wire, melting the nylon thread, detaching the cap, and emptying the drug reservoir.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes AIDS, which is a complex disease that includes gradual destruction of the immune system and deterioration of the central and peripheral nervous system. Therapy that has been used to treat HIV is highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV protease inhibitors (PI), and reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs). However, these therapies have multiple side effects in patients, complexities in the treatment regimen, and development of multidrug resistance. In addition, many of the agents cannot reach residual HIV in the brain, and therefore, it is very important to develop medications that can pass into the brain. In light of these evolving issues, researchers at Purdue University have developed a therapy to combat the HIV pandemic. They have found that nonpeptidyl compounds are strong inhibitors of HIV-1 protease enzymes. The unique structure, which includes urethanes with P2 ligand activity, make these inhibitors effective in attaching to the enzyme's active portion with strong hydrogen bonds and deterring the function of HIV and other multidrug resistant strains of the virus. Currently, these compounds have demonstrated less toxicity and higher potency, which may result in lower doses compared to traditional AIDS medications. These compounds could be used  in combination with current therapies or alone to provide a therapeutically effective, safe treatment of AIDS. Advantages: -More potent, lower doses used -Less toxicities and side effects -Effective against resistant HIV strainsPotential Applications:-AIDS prevention and treatment", 'Therapy for Vaso-Occlusive Crisis in Sickle Cell Disease': 'Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic disease as patients suffer from recurring episodes of sickle cell crisis, extreme pain associated with the obstruction of one or more blood vessels and resultant inflammatory events. A clustering of sickle cells, possibly due to microparticle release during oxidative stress, has been associated with the onset of vascular obstruction. Severe pain results when blood vessels are blocked; this vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) has been described as severe and life-limiting. Currently, the management of VOC requires hospitalization, which usually begins in the emergency room, chronic administration of the drug hydroxyurea, and episodic administration of opioid analgesics such as morphine. Frequent opioid use induces drug tolerance, increased dosing, and problems with dependence, which further increases the burden on patients.The root of the problem in SCD arises from issues in band 3, a red blood cell membrane protein, which is hyperphosphorylated. However, the most influence on band 3 comes from spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), which seems to phosphorylate tyrosine 8 and 21 on band 3. The use of SYK inhibitors in these cases will significantly decrease both band 3 phosphorylation, decrease the number of microparticles in circulation, and prevent the initiation of thrombosis and VOC. By using this concept to find a therapeutic replacement, researchers at Purdue University have proposed the use of a prophylactic treatment with a SYK inhibitor, which could reduce or eliminate the recurrence of sickle cell crisis in both adults and children suffering from SCD. Patients can be administered an inhibitor, such as Gleevec® (imatinib mesylate), an orally-dosed, antineoplastic drug for the treatment of cancers, such as metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors, chronic myeloid leukemia, relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic eosinophilic leukemia. This would be a new, off-label indication of this medication, but the dosage used would still fall within guidelines previously established in the original, approved indication, thus making this safe.Advantages:-Efficient inhibition of band 3 phosphorylation-Prevention and/or reduction of vaso-occlusive events-Less complicated therapy and managementPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical Industry-Medical/Health -Sickle cell disease treatment', 'Increased Proinsulin Yield Using Tandem Reagents': 'Insulin is a therapeutic protein that is produced to treat diabetes mellitus. In 2011, global insulin sales reached $16.7 billion, with a large part being produced in E. coli. In such systems, insulin is expressed as the precursor proinsulin and stored in the E. coli cells as inclusion bodies. To produce insulin, the inclusion bodies must be isolated, denatured, undergo sulfitolysis, and be refolded to form proinsulin. During the in vitro folding of Methionine-Arginine Lyspro-Proinsulin-S-sulfonate (MR-KPB-hPSS), a significant fraction of the folding intermediates aggregate through intermolecular disulfide bond formation, resulting in a yield loss near 40 percent. Therefore, reducing aggregation during in vitro folding can increase the production yield of insulin. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new method using two synergistic folding agents in tandem to convert MR-KPB-hPSS to correctly folded Methionine-Arginine-Lyspro-Proinsulin with an average folding yield of approximately 72 percent. This method uses redox agents in tandem to simultaneously refold MR-KPB-hPSS and reduce aggregation. If purchased at $749/100g, the additional cost to the insulin production process is $1.48 per gram. With the per-unit cost to produce insulin estimated at $50 to $75 per gram, the additional cost to this process is largely offset by the increase in yield. Thus, the proposed changes to conventional proinsulin folding methods can result in significant cost savings for industrial scale insulin manufacturing. Advantages: -Average folding yield increased from 53 percent to over 73 percent -Significant cost savings for industrial-scale insulin manufacturing Potential Applications:-Pharmaceutical Industry-Medical/Healthcare', 'Neuropathic and Inflammatory Pain Therapeutics Targeting Adenylyl Cyclase': 'Chronic pain, such as neuropathic pain, is common in multiple diseases and is a major health concern. Due the multifaceted nature of pain, its basic mechanism is poorly understood; therefore, current therapies are do not meet the needs of many patients. Researchers have identified adenylyl cyclase type 1 (AC1) as a potential target for pain therapy. This enzyme is present in neurons, but not in heart, liver, or kidney cells, which would minimize side effects of AC1 inhibitors to non-neuronal tissues. Currently, only one inhibitor against AC1, called NB001, has been identified. There is a need to identify new therapeutics that target AC1. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a series of compounds that inhibit AC1 in cell culture with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. In addition, these new AC1 inhibitors can be produced via mild and efficient reaction chemistry with high regioselectivity, stereoselectivity, and excellent yield.

Currently available technologies identify kinase substrates; however, there is no existing high throughput technology for identification of a key phosphoprotein's upstream kinases.Purdue University researchers have developed a high-throughput platform to isolate and analyze proteins that only transiently interact under physiological conditions, such as upstream kinases and their substrates. The platform achieves this by combining a protein-fragment complementation assay with mass spectrometry. The researchers use fluorescence protein fragments to stabilize the weak and transient kinase-substrate interactions for mass spectrometry analysis, a method termed fluorescence complementation affinity proteomics (FCAP). Mass spectrometry allows for the unambiguous sequencing of interacting proteins and provides the ability to distinguish specific interacting partners from false identifications through quantitative proteomics.

The predominant form of diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from a combination of reduction in pancreatic beta cell activity and mass, which leads to insufficient insulin production. An enzyme called memapsin 1 is known to be part of the biochemical pathway that leads to the problems with pancreatic beta cells and ultimately causes insulin deficiency. Memapsin 1 deactivates a transmembrane protein shown to increase beta cell proliferation and improve glucose stimulated insulin secretion. The transmembrane protein is deactivated when it undergoes ectodomain cleavage in a process triggered by memapsin 1. Researchers at Purdue University in collaboration with Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation have developed and assayed a series of lead compounds that act as memapsin 1 inhibitors and increase pancreatic beta cell mass. Treatment with these compounds may also be complimented by other therapeutics that increase insulin production, improve glucose homeostasis, or inhibit hyperglucagonemia.

More significantly, both FR901464 and spliceostatin A potently inhibit in vitro splicing and promote pre-mRNA accumulation. The first total synthesis of FR901464 was accomplished in 29-41, which made the original methods time consuming and costly. In addition, it was difficult to produce a pure form of the compound. Researchers at Purdue University have developed concise, enantioselective syntheses of pure FR901464 and spliceostatin A, which can be accomplished in only 10 and 9 linear steps, respectively. By drastically decreasing the number of steps, this method is cost efficient, convergent, and amenable to the synthesis of structural variants.

After peaking from 1997 to 2011, the incidence rate has declined nearly 30 percent from 3.5 million to 2.5 million, and within the last 10 years, the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the combination of at least three antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, within low- and middle-income regions has increased nearly 20-fold. Despite these advances, there is still great need for novel, more powerful treatments to fight new, drug resistant strains of the disease. Researchers at Purdue University have designed, synthesized, and evaluated a series of exceptionally potent HIV-1 protease inhibitors for the treatment of AIDS and HIV infections. These compounds represent a novel new class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors that include Tp-THF and other substituted ligands in combination with P1, P1', and P2' ligands. These compounds have demonstrated potency against wild-type viruses as well as multidrug resistant strains of HIV-1.

Worldwide, there are an estimated 7 to 10 million people living with this disease. Reduced dopamine transmission is known to be a cause of Parkinson's disease.  While a dopamine precursor, levodopa, can be used to alleviate dopamine depletion, it has a very short pharmacokinetic life and increased doses are required over time to achieve desired therapeutic results. Dopamine agonist drugs have been used to activate post synaptic dopamine receptors and allow the available dopamine in the brain to bind efficiently to these receptors. These agonists can be used in monotherapy applications or in conjunction with the standard levodopa therapy. A compound developed by Purdue University researchers, dinoxyline(8,9-dihydroxy-1,2,3,11b-tetragydrichromeno[4,3,2-de]isoquinoline), provides a novel class of therapeutic agents for any disorder that can be treated by drugs affecting dopamine receptors. Where dihydrexidine is ten-fold D1:D2 selective and dinapsoline is five-fold D1:D2 selective, dinoxyline has an equally high affinity for both D1 and D2 receptors. This is surprising considering the structure of this new compound in comparison to related work with other dopamine agonists. The unexpected result suggests that dinoxyline may bind to the D2 receptor in another way, which could translate into unanticipated therapeutic benefits.

Radiation destroys cancer cells by using high-energy photons to damage the cell's DNA. The effectiveness of radiation is dependent upon the oxygen concentration in tumors; however, the abnormal structures of tumor vasculature are leaky, lending the tumor environment hypoxic. Hypoxia can impede the success of radiation therapy because oxygen is necessary for successful cancer treatment. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an ultrasonically powered, implantable micro-oxygen generator that can increase oxygen levels in a tumor target during radiation treatment. The generator has overall dimensions of 1.2mm x 1.3mm x 8mm, so it is small enough to be implanted using a hypodermic needle. This technology performs electrolysis to generate oxygen, which may be able to restore intratumoral oxygen concentrations to a normal or hyperoxygenated level, increasing the effectiveness of cancer treatment outcomes.

Scientists are currently attempting to synthesize  topoisomerase inhibitors that have differing target sites to more effectively eliminate cancer cells. Finding novel binding sites for inhibitors becomes paramount for overcoming drug resistance.Scientists at Purdue University have developed novel compounds to inhibit Topoisomerase I that are intended to cease DNA synthesis and cause cell death.

The enzyme is responsible for structural changes in the DNA protein complex, allowing enzymes easy access for DNA synthesis. Topoisomerases have an important role in regulation of the cell cycle, and when the enzyme is inhibited from completing its task, the cell will activate death pathways. Many anticancer drugs have been designed to target this protein as it is expressed in all proliferating cells, which is a common feature of transformed cells. The problem with the synthesized drugs is they are not easily metabolized by the body and their insolubility makes them difficult to develop in the laboratory, limiting bioavailability. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new topoisomerase I inhibitor that incorporates carbohydrate groups to increase solubility. The result is drug that is more bioavailable and stable, which comes with the added benefit of smaller doses acting more effectively. The synthetic route developed for these compounds is simple, versatile, and easily scalable.

Observations of this enzyme suggest mediating its activity could potentiate the cytotoxic effect of TOP1 inhibitors. TDP1 inhibitory activity has been seen to a limited extent in a handful of compounds, though their potencies, specificities, and pharmacokinetic properties leave much to be desired. Purdue University researchers have developed a series of novel, low molecular-weight compounds that can act as dual inhibitors of both TOP1 and TDP1. A dual inhibitor of this type would offer significant advantages over individual TOP1 and TDP1inhibitors alone such as simplification of delivery and bioavailability. In lab tests, the dual inhibitor is an equally potent TOP1 inhibitor as the commercially available camptothecin. These molecules are thought to function by stalling the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle, thereby inducing apoptosis, and effectively killing the cell.

Journal of the American Chemical Society. 2015, 137 (40), pp 12772–12775.DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5b07875.', 'Recovery of Function In Chronic Spinal Cord Injury': "In the United States, there are between 240,000 to 337,000 people chronically injured with severe behavioral loss from spinal cord damage, with approximately 12,500 new cases each year. There is currently no treatment that can recover functions for those affected. Previously, researchers at Purdue University's Center for Paralysis Research have shown 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to be clinically effective in treating chronic spinal cord injury in both dog and man; the compound is now in phase II human clinical tests. Purdue University researchers have developed chemical analogues of 4-AP with superior pharmacological properties compared to the parent compound. Special analogues and cocrystals of the compound 4-AP were synthesized and their biological properties were tested. These compounds and all related derivatives and prodrugs dissolve readily at stomach pH facilitating the distribution of the parent compound and the analogues through the body subsequent to oral intake. These drugs (under stomach pH) have been shown to improve nerve impulse conduction through injured spinal cords in in vitro experimental models. Advantages: -More effective than 4-AP -Long-term stability -Slow dissolution -Facilitates ease of clinical administrationPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals", 'Synthesis of Novel Anticancer Agent Peloruside A': 'Peloruside A (1), a 16-membered macrolide antitumor agent, was first isolated by L. West and P. Northcote from the New Zealand marine sponge, Mycale hentscheli.  It has shown potent antitumor activity against resistant cell lines, such as P388 murine leukemia cells with an IC50 value of 10 ng/mL. Peloruside A is a microtubule stabilizing agent operating with a similar mechanism to the most widely used anticancer agent, taxol, and has shown a synergistic effect with taxol itself. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a process for synthetic production of Peloruside A, which is amenable to the development of analogs and derivatives of this important molecule. This synthetic strategy opens the possibility of creating unnatural analogs of Peloruside A with improved potency, bioavailability, and other pharmacokinetic properties. These developments will facilitate drug discovery for cancer treatment. Advantages: -Novel synthetic pathway to highly potent cancer drug -Synthetic process amenable to drug discovery of improved therapeuticsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-Cancer Treatment', 'Treatment for Demyelinating Diseases and Conditions': 'Mechanical damage to the nervous system of mammals sometimes results in irreversible functional deficits. Most functional deficits associated with trauma to both the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) and Central Nervous System (CNS) result from damage to the nerve fiber or axon, blocking the flow of nerve impulse traffic along the nerve fiber. Spinal cord injury is a compression injury to the cord where the injured region of anatomically intact nerve fibers does not function. In particular, this local region (usually less than 1 vertebral segment in extent) does not conduct nerve impulses through the region of damage. 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) has shown promise in restoring nerve function in paralyzed persons; however, clinically meaningful recoveries of function only occur in about 30 percent of the treated population.  For the balance of those receiving treatment, recoveries are associated with numerous unwanted side effects, such as dizziness, loss of balance, and seizure. Researchers at Purdue University have developed analogues of 4-AP, which provide longer lasting effects at a lower concentration with fewer side effects than comparable treatments with 4-AP. The compounds, upon in vivo administration, reduced the effect of traumatic CNS tissue injury by the restoration of nerve impulse conduction through nerve tissue lesions. Advantages: -Analogue of known pharmaceutical -Restores nerve impulse and function in spinal cord injury -Longer lasting than current standard, with lower dose and fewer side effectsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals', 'Synthesis and Applications of Trifluoroacetate': 'The incorporation of fluorine into fine chemicals has had a significant impact in the chemical, agrochemical, and pharmaceutical industries given nearly 20 percent of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine and significantly more agrochemicals contain fluorination. Fluoroform is a gas that is used in industrial processes, but it is a potent "greenhouse" gas. Because of this, the use of gaseous fluoroform must be strictly limited to prevent its unwanted escape into the atmosphere. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new synthetic reagent and method for the mild and efficient preparation of fluorinated compounds. This simple and straightforward method can be accomplished by a novice chemist, at room temperature, in open air, and without the need for complicated inert atmosphere techniques. Among other intermediates, Purdue researchers validated this method through its use in the aldol and imino-aldol processes, the facile production of difluoroenolates, and the formation of alpha, alpha-difluorinated beta amino acids. Difluorinated molecules, such as beta amino acids, are important research tools and building blocks for drug discovery. Advantages: -Novel trifluoroacetate release strategy uses mild conditions (room temperature) -Generation of pharmaceutically important intermediates -Compatible with large scope of substratesPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Chemical Analysis-Drug Development', 'Touch Actuated Micropump for Transdermal Drug Delivery': "Transdermal delivery of medications and other compounds has been aggressively pursued for many decades. Although patches have been used to deliver small hydrophobic molecules such as nicotine and nitroglycerin, an external pressure source in conjunction with a direct subcutaneous access port are required to deliver the majority of therapeutically important drugs through the skin. Microfluidics has played an important role in this area by providing microneedle arrays and miniature pumps. Although microneedle arrays made of silicon, polymers, and metals have reached a high degree of maturity in the past decade, their application has been limited due to the lack of a suitable micropump with adequate flow rate and back pressure.Purdue University researchers have developed a new type of pump for drug-delivery patches that would use arrays of microneedles to deliver a wider range of medications possible than with conventional patches. The pump contains a liquid that boils at body temperature so that the heat from a finger's touch causes it to rapidly turn into a vapor, exerting enough pressure to dispense the drug through the microneedles. This technology's low-cost and battery-less operation make it the ideal single-use disposable transdermal drug dispenser. Advantages:-Battery-less operation-Low-cost and disposablePotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Medical devices-Pharmaceuticals-Drug development", 'Aluminum Hydroxide Adjuvants Vaccine Linkers': 'Vaccines typically work by exposing the body to an antigen, which is either a weakened form of a microorganism or a toxin that it creates. This exposure stimulates an immune system response that lets the body recognize the pathogen so that it can more easily recognize and destroy it in the future. Sometimes, the proteins used in the vaccine are bound to an adjuvant (commonly aluminum hydroxide), which acts as an irritant to enhance the immune response to the antigen while reducing the amount of foreign material that must be injected. To attach the aluminum hydroxide to the protein, a phosphate group is first attached to the protein. Phosphate groups have a high electrostatic affinity for aluminum hydroxide, so they readily bond to each other. However, current techniques for attaching the phosphate group to a protein have the unintended effect of changing the structure of the protein. Purdue University researchers have developed a simple chemical reagent that attaches a phosphate group to specific sites on the protein, but does not change the overall structure. This method can work with a wide variety of antigens and could lead to vaccines that are more effective for many pathogens. Advantages: -Does not modify protein structure -Works with many varieties of antigens -Uses adjuvant with excellent safety recordPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceutical industry-Vaccines', 'Vitamin E Metabolites for Inflammatory Disease Treatment': 'The immune system plays a central role in maintaining health and disease development, but excessive immune response leads to inflammation. Proinflammatory mediators play important roles in regulating inflammatory response. Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) play key roles in inflammatory responses; they are believed to be important in the development of degenerative disease as well.  Purdue University researchers have identified several vitamin E metabolites that act as potent inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2, resulting in decreased inflammation. In addition, these long-chain carboxychromanols inhibit 5-LOX.  Because these compounds inhibit the inflammation response through multiple pathways, they are useful anti-inflammatory agents and should have decreased side effects.  Targeting COX-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX will result in a more potent anti-inflammatory effect than current nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These compounds have potential use as effective cancer prevention and therapeutic agents, and in other chronic diseases, e.g., cardiovascular disease.

Among many strategies to combat this disease, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with HIV protease inhibitors in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors continues to be the first-line treatment for control of HIV infection. This treatment regimen has definitely improved quality of life, enhanced HIV management, and halted the progression of the disease, and today, more people than ever before are living with HIV/AIDS. However, HIV is quick to develop resistance to new protease inhibitors. As a result, the pharmaceutical industry is continuously searching for new drugs to fight drug-resistant HIV. Darunavir is currently the industry gold standard and has shown the most efficacy in treating drug-resistant HIV strains. Researchers at Purdue University have designed a series of novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors for treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. These compounds have shown enzyme inhibitory activity and antiviral potency on par with Darunavir. Detailed virological studies suggest drug-resistance profiles with the potential to outperform Darunavir, positioning this promising class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors on deck in the fight against drug-resistant HIV.Advantages:-High enzyme inhibitory activity and antiviral potency-Exceptional drug-resistance profilePotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-HIV/AIDS Treatment', 'Novel Ligands for HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors': 'The AIDS epidemic is one of the most challenging problems in medicine in the 21st century. A retrovirus designated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a complex disease that includes progressive destruction of the immune system and degeneration of the central and peripheral nervous system.Among many strategies to combat this disease, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) continues to be the first-line treatment for control of HIV infection. This treatment regimen has definitely improved quality of life, enhanced HIV management, and halted the progression of the disease. Today, more people than ever before are living with HIV/AIDS thanks to this first-line treatment. However, despite the impressive success, there remain many challenges to treating this devastating disease, including decreasing both the toxicity and complexity of the treatment regimens. In addition, there is a growing population of patients that are developing multidrug-resistant strains of HIV, and there is ample evidence that these strains can be further transmitted. Purdue University researchers have designed and synthesized a novel class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors, which show potency 10x greater than that of Darunavir, an FDA-approved inhibitor developed by the same researchers. A number of these inhibitors are very potent against multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants and could lead to additional drugs used in HIV/AIDS treatment.Advantages: -HIV therapeutic with 10-fold potency increase over current standard-Effective for the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains of HIV Potential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-HIV/AIDS Treatment'}

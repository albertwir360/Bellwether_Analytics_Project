Targeting T Cells in Tumor Microenvironments through Immunotherapy,"Researchers at Purdue University have created a ligand-targeted drug for reprogramming the body's immune system to eliminate cancer. This targeting strategy introduces a new frontier in medicinal chemistry and cancer therapeutics. Currently, cancer cells rather than immune cells in the tumor microenvironment are studied to develop therapies for solid tumors. However, immunoinhibiting regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are abundant in tumor microenvironments, can have greater potential to regenerate anti-tumor immunity. The approach developed by Purdue University involves the reprogramming of Tregs using of a targeting molecule with specificity for Tregs that can deliver an attached inhibitory drug solely to Tregs. Uptake of this inhibitory drug by the tumor Tregs then blocks the Tregs immunosuppressive properties and thereby allows the patient's immune system to eradicate the tumor. By targeting the therapeutic drug in this manner, the immunoinhibiting function of Tregs can be silenced without changing the immune system elsewhere in the body. Advantages:-Strong binding affinity-Small molecule treatment of tumors-Reprograms the immune systemPotential Applications:-Cancer Therapy-Molecular Medicinal Chemistry-Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing"
Mass Tag Analysis for Rare Cells and Cell Free Molecules,"There are many research methods related to rare cell identification given its importance to the early detection of rare diseases and cancer. Current research methods have specific problems, such as fluorescent tagging disrupts the chemistry of the cell, dilution methods lack accuracy, and mass tagging's minute scale of observation.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method of analyzing rare cells and molecules using mass tags, filtration, ionization, and mass spectrometry. Through ionization, heterogeneous fluids, e.g., blood samples, can be processed for a better mass reading once the samples go through an ordinary mass spectrometer. Since it is not an additive refinement process, there is no concern for the disruption of the cell's chemical makeup. This method can determine whether there is a presence of rare cells, identify the cells, and quantify the number of cells. With all of this data, more accurate diagnoses can be made.	Advantages:-Quantifiable data-No chemical alterationsPotential applications:-Molecule identification-Rare disease diagnosis"
Thermoelectric sensor for detecting viruses like SARS-CoV-2,Purdue University researchers have ideated a thermoelectric sensor which selectively identifies exothermic viral pathogen reactions utilizing the Seebeck effect. The sensor offers fast and precise readouts through detecting temperature changes through a voltage readout after interactions of pathogen antigen/antibody. Silicon material is used as the sensor's base material facilitating scale up through standard device fabrication processes. Modification of this technology to pathogen RNA/complementary DNA hybridization amplify the voltage change in patients with low viral load. This sensor can be used for a wide range of diseases with high epidemic potential increasing the utility.Advantages:-Fast and precise diagnostics-Label free viral detection-No RNA preparation needed-Easy scale-up manufacturingPotential Applications:-COVID-19 diagnostic-Epidemic testing
Collaborative Computing Platform for Health Data,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new method of collaborative cloud computing for electronic medical records. Current software databases used by healthcare providers, hospitals, and insurance providers must be translated between different programming languages and platforms in order to communicate patient needs. The Purdue researchers' approach integrates and aggregates vital data from Apache Hadoop, Jupyter Hub, Kubernetes, and Apache Hive databases into one system. This database architecture enhances parallelization, performance, and query processing time. The software program created by Purdue University improves data memory, mapping, and storage as well as local and global accessibility through an innovative authentication process. In testing with Center Health Fact data from 750 hospitals specific to over 69 million unique patients collected over the years 2000-2018, this tool was able to sift and report data with exceptional efficiency. Advantages:-Efficient-Cost-effective-Secure-Convenient-AccuratePotential Applications:-Healthcare-Insurance-Patient careCollaborative Cloud Computing Framework for Health Data with Open Source TechnologiesarXiv:2007.10498"
Human Monoclonal Folate Receptor Beta Antibody,"Folic acid is a vitamin required for the synthesis of DNA nucleotide bases and is essential for proliferation of all cells. To take in folic acid, some cells express a folate receptor that binds folic acid very tightly and carries it into the cell via endocytosis. There are four types of folate receptors: alpha; beta; gamma; delta, and these receptors are preferentially overexpressed on cancer cells.  Purdue University researchers have developed a method for using a human monoclonal antibody against beta folate receptors. By targeting cancer cells and binding antibodies to the beta folate receptors on those cells, researchers can block some of the beta folate receptors on the cells. This lowers the amount of folic acid the cancer cell is receiving and prevents its rapid proliferation. By attaching chemical groups to the antibody, e.g. therapeutics or imaging agents, this approach can be used to potentially treat or identify cancers. It is particularly useful for targeting of chronic and acute leukemia, and has potential to treat these disorders, along with immunological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Advantages:-Lowers the amount of folic acid cancer cells take in-Potential cancer treatment-Also treats inflammatory disorders"
Inactivation of Airborne Viruses using Aerosols or vapor of Photoreactive FDA-Approved Food Coloring Dyes ,"​Purdue University researchers have developed a voluminous antiviral phototherapy technique that uses aerosols or vapor of FDA-approved food coloring dyes to mitigate risk of airborne transmission of pathogens. Many viruses and bacterial diseases are transmitted through air, making it critical to disinfect and sanitize large volumes of indoor air where many people are present. Contemporary disinfection methods include using biohazardous materials such as aerosolized hydrogen peroxide and cancer-causing UV illumination, limiting their utility indoors and exemplifying the need for biocompatible air sanitation methods in population dense areas. To address this need, Purdue University researchers have demonstrated visible light activation of several FDA-approved food coloring dyes generate singlet oxygen, which can be used to kill airborne pathogens. The short traveling distance of singlet oxygen (less than 300 nm) acts as a safeguard against human exposure. They have also ideated an electrostatic spray system for the dyes allowing for uniform fog-like dispersion to minimize wetting. In addition, as healthcare workers are often infected when removing personal protective equipment (PPE), this technology can be installed in a confined chamber for healthcare professionals to change PPE in hospital settings. Advantages:-Non-UV light Illumination-No Need for Carcinogenic Nanomaterials-Safe, Increase Reusability of PPE-Minimize Solvent UsagePotential Applications:-Healthcare-Hospital Acquired Infection Mitigation-Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)COVID-19 Pandemic"
N95 Filter/Mask Combination for Mitigation of Respiratory Disease Transmission,​COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases spread through small aerosolized droplets produced by infected individuals. These small droplets stay suspended in the air for hours and can be inhaled by the non-infected populace leading to spread of the disease. Typical cotton masks/face coverings are not effective at stopping droplets from being inhaled or potentially spread by infected individuals. Purdue University researchers have developed a pocket containing mask/interchangeable filter combination which when used together provide more protection than cotton masks alone. The pocket functions as an insert location for the filter placed over the mouth of the wearer. These filters can be easily attached to other cotton masks/face coverings as well via provided tape or Velcro. The filter is made of antibacterial and superhydrophobic N95 material and provides a simple alternative to the N95 masks while using less resources to produce. Advantages:-Less Resource Intensive-Increased Protection from Respiratory DiseasesPotential Applications:-COVID-19 Pandemic-Respiratory Diseases-Healthcare System-Preventing Infection Spread
"Pod: An At-Home, Portable, Universal Allergen Detector","An Industrial Design student at Purdue University has developed a new allergen detector known as Pod to identify allergens in food items. Current technology is mainly focused on gluten or peanut allergies, and available kits for testing food items often involve microlaboratory setups that are inconvenient to use. The small, stylish design created by Purdue University features a magnetic backing for placement on a refrigerator and is also portable to carry for everyday use such as for restaurants or grocery stores. In addition, food labels can also be scanned by Pod to check for potential allergens, providing added peace of mind.  Advantages: -Convenient-Portable-Accurate -Can detect multiple allergens Potential Applications:-Food Safety -Everyday Lifestyle-Medical/Patient Care"
Deep Tissue High Resolution Neuroimaging,"Researchers at Purdue University have discovered a method for estimating the location of fluorescent targets that are embedded at millimeter and centimeter depths in biological tissue that enables imaging with very high spatial resolution. By combining the estimated location of many inhomogeneities, a super-resolution image can be formed. This invention has the potential to have a major impact on the study of brain science, because neuron activation can modulate fluorescence emission in space and time.Advantages:-Direct Access to Neuron Activation-Super-resolution of NeuronsPotential Applications:-Brain Imaging-Brain Disease Diagnostics"
Strain Gauge Integrated Magnetic Microactuator for Smart Self-Clearing Catheter,"Hydrocephalus is a neurological disease characterized by an excessive accumulation of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain. Treatment requires the implantation of shunts through which CSF can be drained from the brain.  However, the failure rate of these systems remain high, especially among children. According to the Journal of Neurosurgery, a study conducted from April 2008 to December 2011 reported that 33% out of 1036 patients experienced shunt failure. Common causes of failure include obstruction, over-drainage, and loculated ventricles.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an implantable catheter capable of obstruction detection and removal, device alignment, and flow rate measurement. Previously, Purdue researchers introduced a fully integrated self-clearing implantable catheter that was able to clear obstructions, but found that once the device was implanted it was impossible to determine whether the device was oriented properly or actuating as expected. With new additions, in real-time the catheter can detect obstructions, confirm device alignment, and measure the CSF flow-rate on top of the existing biofouling-removal capabilities of the microactuator in the catheter. This device has demonstrated the ability to solve one of the largest challenges that clinicians encounter with chronically implanted catheters. Advantages:-Obstruction Detection-Device Alignment-Flow Rate Measurement-Self-Clearing-Ease of FabricationPotential Applications: -Hydrocephalus Treatment"
Optical Detection Of Neurological Alterations,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new non-invasive technology to detect neurological alterations caused by disease and/or injury. The current Pupillary light reflex (PLR) tests are conducted by pen light exam, which tends to be heuristic, empirical, qualitative often leading to misdiagnosis due to human error. Even though there are some quantitative pupillometry devices that are available in the market, it is often associated with high startup cost and a work accurately under a narrow range of conditions. This PLR technology developed at Purdue uses elegant mathematical modeling to detect neurological alterations. It is compatible with any imaging platform and eye color. It delivers automated, accurate, objective measurements in real-time.Advantages:-Portable- Easy to use-Accurate- AutomatedPotential Applications:-Monitor neurological alterations due to disease and/or injury"
Adaptable Respiratory Rate Monitoring for Commercial Fitness Devices ,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed new signal processing techniques for measuring respiratory rates. Through algorithms that measure inhale and exhale frequency of patients as well as heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) can be determined. Unlike current technologies, this algorithm can be integrated into existing commercial fitness devices. The low-power, portable technology can also be implemented into Kangaroo Mother Care pouches for use in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). The system is found to operate at a rate between seven and thirteen breaths per minute, and showed improved modeling compared to other similar algorithms. The measures of baseline drift as well as QRS complex height for ventricle hypertrophy were enhanced by using the Purdue University approach. Advantages:-Low Power -Portable -Adaptable with existing devices -Accurate Potential Applications:-Fitness -Neonatal Care -Hospitals -Medical"
Repurposed Drug for Clostridium Difficile Infection,"Researchers at Purdue University developed a repurposed drug as a potent inhibitor of Clostridium difficile. Clostridium difficile is the most common and costly healthcare-associated infection with an estimated half a million cases and approximately 29,000 deaths occurring annually in the United States. The rate of death associated with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is rising, and the infection is occurring in populations previously considered to be at low risk. Treatment with the standard of care falls short; after treatment, patients' intestines become colonized by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The repurposed drug is capable of killing hypervirulent strains of C. diff, suppressing C. diff spore formation, preventing VRE colonization, and avoiding absorption from the intestine. The drug is approved for its original indication outside of the US for oral consumption and in the US for topical application.Advantages:-Kills Clostridium difficile-Suppresses Clostridium difficile spore formation-Reduces vancomycin-resistant enterococci colonizationPotential Applications:-Treatment of Clostridium difficile infection"
Method of Thin Flexible Electrode Insertion for Deep Brain Neural Recording and the Design of Electrode Insertion Device,"Inserting a device to record deep brain activity is not a new technology.  However, the current technology is not as efficient as it could be.  Some of the problems with the current technology include leaving a flexible electrode behind after completion of the recording, coating with biodegradable materials to increase stiffness, and using a magnetic field to obtain necessary energy to penetrate the brain.  All of these issues are very invasive to the brain that is being recorded and could potentially cause health issues for the individual.  There is a need for a less invasive way to record deep brain activity.  Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that allows for less invasive recording of deep brain activity.  This new technology allows for insertion of 25 um platinum electrode in the deep brain.  This electrode does not need any supporting tube, cannula, or biodegradable material to assist it in the recording of the deep brain.  This means it is much less invasive and cause minimal neuronal damage.  This new technology could open the door for recording deep brain activity. Advantages: -No support needed-Less invasive-Causes minimal neuronal damage Potential Applications: -Neurological studies-Brain surgery"
"Efficient, Wearable Body Heating and Cooling System","Researchers at Purdue University have developed an efficient thermoelectric, wearable body heating and cooling system device. Whereas an electric heater only allows for heating, this thermoelectric heat pump provides hot and cold therapy with a higher efficiency. Furthermore, the thermoelectric generator can be operated by rechargeable battery(s) and can be used over several hours. Additionally, this technology can be used in a jacket or a vest in extreme weather conditions by soldiers, first responders, and others working outdoors.Advantages:-Wearable -Efficient -Battery operatedPotential Applications:-Sports and Sports Medicine -Military Thermal Wear-Cold Therapy-Pain Reliever -Vascular Enhancement"
MRSA Elimination,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a staph infection resistant to many antibiotics used to treat typical staph infections. According to Mayo Clinic Staff, there are two common types of MRSA: healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) and community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA). HA-MRSA tends to be the result of invasive procedures, e.g. device implantation. The latter, CA-MRSA, is spread through skin-to-skin contact, typically beginning as a painful boil. In addition, MRSA is considered to be even more life-threatening if combined with sepsis or necrotizing pneumonia. Because MRSA is drug-resistant, there is need for a method of prevention and elimination of the infection. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a drug-free approach to eliminating MRSA. Using blue-light bleaching, along with hydrogen peroxide, have shown to eliminate a MRSA culture and a MRSA infection of a mouse wound. This has shown to be a safe and effective method of eliminating MRSA.  Advantages: -Safe -Effective-Drug-free approachPotential Applications: -MRSA prevention-MRSA treatment"
Radiation-Controlled Release of Drugs for Chemo-Radiotherapy,"Over 60,000 new cases of head and neck cancer were diagnosed within the US in 2016, with 20 percent of these cases resulting in death. The current treatment of advanced head and neck cancer involves surgery followed by radiation, i.e. concurrent radiation, systemic chemotherapy, induction chemotherapy, or radiation alone. However, the surgeries are difficult, and radiation therapy afterwards is beneficial only for a few months. Conventional chemotherapy involves administering drugs through veins into the bloodstream, which involves high levels of toxicity and specific eligibility requirements. In addition, only 5 percent of the drug actually reaches the tumor site. There is need of a method for treating locally advanced tumors more effectively.     Researchers at Purdue University have developed a radiation-controlled drug release formulation. The formulation allows toxicity and side effects associated with radiation from chemotherapy to be minimized by co-encapsulating the drug within protective capsules and injecting the solution into the patient's tumor before receiving normal radiotherapy. The release rate of the drug is controlled by radiation dose and frequency, allowing maintained drug concentration within the therapeutic level and toxic threshold over an extended period of time. This technology would be used to help medical/surgical/radiation/interventional oncologists who want to apply chemo-radiotherapy to cancer patients with tumors safely and effectively without compromising their quality of life.  Advantages: -Controlled drug release-Minimized toxicity-Effectiveness-Longer lifespan Potential Applications: -Chemo-radiotherapy"
Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors as Treatment for Gonorrhea   ,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new treatment for the drug resistant pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae. CDC has reported a 67% increase in gonorrhoea cases, a sexually transmitted disease, between 2013 and 2017. Pathogenic strains of gonorrhea are notorious for rapidly developing resistance to the current line of antibiotic treatments rendering them futile. The new treatment developed at Purdue leverages FDA approved carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) to develop novel analogs that are potent with a narrow spectrum of action to treat gonorrhea. These analogs target the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase in the bacteria, which is crucial for the bacteria to maintain CO2 and pH homeostasis. They do not target other commensal bacteria that are required to maintain healthy microbiome. Most importantly, their mechanism of action prevents the development of rapid antibiotic resistance. Advantages:-Selectively targets N. gonorrhea-Does not target gut and/or vaginal microbiota-Prevents rapid resistance development-Works synergistically with approved antibioticsPotential Applications:-Treatment of Gonorrhea and treating medical conditions related to  antibiotic resistant strains of N.gonorrhoeae."
New Class of Anticancer Chemotherapy Agents,"According to the National Cancer Institute, approximately 40 percent of people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime and worldwide number of diagnostics are predicted to increase nearly 50 percent by 2030. Nearly 2 percent of all men and 1.5 percent of all women are killed each year by cancer. Cancer is simply described as continuous and uncontrolled division of cells leading to tumors. With the increase in cancer cases worldwide and the lack of a consistent treatment, new development are still needed in the field.Researchers at Purdue University have synthesized a number of natural products that inhibit cell splicing. These herboxidiene derivatives inhibit cell division through its interactions with the proteins responsible for pre-mRNA splicing. This technology shows potential for use in a variety of select human cancers with increased functionality and consistent stability and potency. Advantages: -Stable and potent-Appropriate drug functionalities for conjugates Potential Applications: -Pharmaceuticals-Anticancer, chemotherapy drugs"
New BACE1 Inhibitors for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"According to the Alzheimer's Association, nearly one in every nine Americans above the age of 65 have Alzheimer's disease. The causes of this disease are poorly understood and there is currently no cure for it. Current treatments may temporarily improve symptoms, but cannot stop or reverse the progression of this disease and their side effects include nausea, headaches, confusion and vomiting. There is a clear need for improvement in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Researchers at Purdue University have synthesized new compounds capable of improving current treatments of Alzheimer's. These compounds are of a stable BACE1 inhibitor, which has been shown to help treat the disease in mice. Compared to other BACE1 inhibitor treatments, this compound is selective, expected metabolically stable, and very potent. This would likely lead to the reduction of side effects from treatment, such as headaches and dizziness, because of the inhibitor's selectiveness. These compounds have vastly improved drug properties compared to other BACE1 inhibitors currently available.Advantages:-Very potent-Metabolically stable-Selective BACE1 inhibitorPotential Applications:-Treatment of Alzheimer's disease"
Electronic Healthcare Supply Chain Management for Developing Countries,"Researchers at Purdue University have developed a healthcare inventory-tracking and supply chain management system to improve patient outcomes in developing countries. Paper-based healthcare supply chain management systems, commonly used in developing countries, have many limitations related to providing the up-to-date information needed for real-time decision-making. This lack of data can result in undersupply of pharmaceuticals, overstocks of expired medications, or delays in treatment. The Purdue software has a cloud-based centralized database structure supported by an offline-compatible mobile platform and is able to triangulate patient admission data, diagnoses, supply delivery information, testing reports and inventory information and generate reports accordingly. This software aims to reduce time needed to prepare orders, incidence of stock-out and overstock of targeted medical supplies, and ultimately help improve patient outcomes.Advantages:-Complete transparent tracking (from donor resources to beneficiaries)-Multiple organization and country program management-Automatic reports (for inventory, beneficiary, monthly, etc.)-Cloud-based (most up-to-date supply chain status, maintained and updated remotely)-Web-based (accessible from location without installing any App)-Cross-platform (Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, etc.)Potential Applications:-Healthcare in developing countries"
"Breathable, Paper-based Epidermal Electronics","Current manufacturing methods and materials for epidermal electronics are complex and expensive, which prevent their adoption as single-use medical devices. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a low-cost, omniphobic, paper-based wearable or implantable epidermal electronic to monitor health status. Whereas current metallic based skin-mountable or implantable devices are not breathable and short-circuit in high humidity situations, this porous, paper-based technology is not impacted by moisture changes and is highly breathable. Furthermore, this technology makes epidermal electronic devices accessible to high-throughput manufacturing technologies to allow the fabrication of a variety of wearable medical devices at a low cost. Advantages:-Breathable-Not impacted by moisture-Low-costPotential Applications:-Wearable or implantable epidermal electronics"
Novel Inhalation Formulation of Antimicrobials,"Antimicrobial therapy via the inhalation route has attracted increasing momentum for the treatment of lower respiratory systems. Inhalation therapy improves drug concentration on airway surfaces with reduced systemic exposure. Typically, the inhaled drug particles produced by the traditional jet-milling approach are highly cohesive and have poor flowability and aerosolization performance. Addition of excipients, such as lactose particles, may improve the aerosolization of cohesive powders; however, for high-dose drugs, like antibiotics, the addition of excipients may increase the inhalation powder mass that needs an excessive number of inhalations to complete the dose and a bulky inhaler to accommodate the large dose.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel inhalation formulation which shows superior antibacterial activity. Incorporation of this formulation is evidenced by an almost two-fold increase in aerosol delivery efficiency expressed as fine particle fraction. The synergistic antimicrobial activities and the increased aerosolization performance from this formulation will not only improve patient compliance by reducing the inhaled powder mass and minimizing local adverse effects, but will also have the potential to achieve superior therapeutic efficacy.Advantages: -Enhanced antimicrobial activity-Reduces inhaled powder mass-Minimizes local adverse effectsPotential Applications: -Dry powder inhalers-Respiratory infections-Antimicrobial therapy via inhalation"
"Anti-Angiogenesis Compound Targets Laminin Receptor in Cancer Cells
","Laminin receptor (37/67 LR) is a membrane protein when over-expressed can promote metastasis of cancer cells. This is due to the ability of 37/67 LR to promote blood vessel formation in tumors in a process called angiogenesis. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is an endogenous protein that can bind to 37/67 LR to inhibit angiogenesis. PEDF is a viable therapy for cancer patients but due to it being an endogenous protein there are enzymes present in the body that degrade it. As well as, peptide formulation for drug delivery is difficult due to protein stability. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a small molecule that elicits a similar response as PEDF when it binds to 37/67 LR. Upon binding to 37/67 LR, the hit compound, C3, modulated an anti-angiogenesis pathway that inhibited prostate cancer cell viability, proliferation, and migration. Due to C3 being a small molecule, it did not bind to PEDF proteolytic enzymes, thus, bypassing PEDF degradation process which could result in longer duration of action. C3 is a promising hit compound which has potential for future development as a lead compound for prostate cancer treatment.Advantages: -Anti-tumor-Anti-angiogenesis-Bypass proteolytic degradationPotential Applications: -Prostate cancer therapy-ChemotherapyRelated Publication: Charles Samuel Umbaugh Et al., A dock derived compound against laminin receptor (37 LR) exhibits anti-cancer properties in a prostate cancer cell line modelOncotarget, 2018, Vol. 9, (No. 5), pp: 5958-5978"
Higher Binding Strength of Surgical Sealant,"In a report published by MedMarket Diligence LLC in 2017, the United States accounts for 30% of the 114 million surgical wounds that occur every year worldwide. The traditional method of closing surgical incisions are staples and sutures. The major disadvantages of staples and sutures are pain, infection, and added trips to doctor to remove them. Medical professionals have an increasing interest in ways to decrease the risk of infection and eliminate the damage of healthy tissue near the surgical site. Surgical sealants are a promising technology that could hold incisions closed without mechanical support of sutures or staples. There are a few commercially available surgical sealants. Commercially available surgical sealants have poor elasticity and adhesive strength and, therefore, require mechanical support. A strong and elastic surgical sealant would not require additional support. A first generation sealant have addressed the elasticity problem with the development of their first generation surgical sealant.Recently, researchers at Purdue University have modified their their first generation surgical sealant to improve its adhesive strength. The adhesive strength was higher for the second generation in comparison to the first generation surgical sealant on pig skin at physiological conditions. The adhesive strength was also measured on aluminum and it was found that second generation was 130% stronger than first generation adhesive and 14,000% stronger than Tisseel (commercially available surgical sealant from Baxter). Advantages: -Decreased risk of incision infection-Decreased pain and scarring at surgical sites-High adhesive strength and elasticityPotential Applications: -Closing surgical incisions"
Evaluate Glucose Concentrations Using a Selective Condenser for Collection of Exhaled Breath Condensate,"While self-monitoring of blood glucose is critical to properly controlling diabetes, 67% of patients fail to monitor their glucose levels due to the inconvenience of collecting finger-prick blood samples. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a promising non-invasive sample for glucose monitoring purposes due to its highly controlled physiological regulation. However, this may reduce reliability because the concentration of glucose is diluted by additional water vapor and the inclusion of anatomical dead space air, causing a wide range of reported EBC glucose concentrations.  By selectively collecting only exhaled breath that has been exchanged with lung fluid, it is anticipated that a greater fraction of glucose can be collected in the condensate.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an automated and selective exhaled breath condenser for glucose monitoring. This is the first condenser of its kind to actually separate and exclude dead space air from lung fluid-exchanged air. The condensate collected from this device provides a robust sample for evaluating glucose concentrations without variable dilution factors from dead space condensate that could impact the reliability of the sample.Advantages: -Separates/excludes dead space air from lung fluid-exchanged air-Provides robust sample for glucose concentration evaluation-Improves reliability of glucose samplesPotential Applications: -Glucose monitoring-Glycemic control-Diabetes treatment"
Next Generation Probiotic that Improves Gut Health and Provides Protection against Enteric Pathogens,"Listeria monocytogenes is an opportunistic human foodborne pathogen responsible for severe systemic infection (listeriosis) which can lead to stillborn and premature births, as well as mortality in newborns, the elderly, and other immunocompromised individuals. Listeria monocytogenes is well adapted to survive in the harsh environment of the gut. Currently, there is no probiotic based protection against the Listeria monoctyogenes infection available.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a next generation probiotic bacteria that binds to intestinal epithelial cells with high affinity to the receptor protein Hsp60 on the intestinal surface. This reduces inflammatory response and prevents Listeria monocytogenes from entering the intestinal epithelial cell barrier. This probiotic bacterium improves gut epithelial barrier integrity and helps protect against disease. The number of pathogens that crossed intestinal cells is reduced significantly.  In mouse studies, 90% of mice were protected from the disease.Advantages: -Protects against L. monocytogenes-Improves gut epithelial barrier integrityPotential Applications: -L. monocytogenes protection-Chronic inflammatory conditions"
Selective Janus Kinase Inhibitors for Autoimmune Disease,"An estimated 24 million people in the United States are affected by autoimmune diseases, a group of diseases in which the patient's immune system attacks parts of their own body. One cellular pathway implicated in the pathology of autoimmune disease involves regulation of gene expression mediated by a family of four related molecules known as Janus kinases, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Because of their importance in disease, this family of kinases is the target of a number of drug molecules, two of which, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, have been approved by the FDA. Unfortunately, the approved drugs still suffer from a number of debilitating side effects. One source of these side effects is the lack of these drugs' selectivity among the four Janus kinases. A drug that inhibits only one of the four Janus kinases promises reduced side effects.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a series of molecules, based on a new JAK inhibitor scaffold, that display selective inhibition for different members of the Janus kinase family. One particular compound, designed for high potency and stability, exhibits very good activity and selectivity against JAK1, with 3.3 nM activity and 10 fold and 30 fold selectivity versus JAK2 and JAK3, respectively. These new inhibitors promise to give relief to sufferers of psoriasis, myelofibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases with a reduction in side effects compared to current therapies.

Intravascular Photoacoustic Tomography Assessment of Lipid Content in Arteries,"Photoacoustic imaging is a biomedical imaging modality based on the use of laser-generated ultrasound.  This technology has been improving for the last ten years.  Currently, other types of imaging like x-ray angiography or OCT have some problems including insufficient resolution or does not have enough depth or chemical information.  There is a need for a new technology that can improve photoacoustic imaging and make it a better solution than current imaging technologies. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that is a catheter-based intravascular imaging in the presence of luminal blood.  This technology allows doctors or preclinical researchers to get information about lipid deposit in arterial wall in vivo.  It does this by accurately and reliably assess the vulnerability of the artery.  This technology could greatly improve artery assessment by photoacoustic imaging in the future. Advantages: -Accurate assessment of artery-Reliable assessment of arteryPotential Applications: -Artery assessment-Photoacoustic imaging"
Acid Reflux Induced Laryngospasm as a Potential Mechanism of Sudden Death in Epilepsy,"There is growing evidence that laryngospasm may be linked to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). There are an estimated 3.4 million Americans, including 470,000 children, living with epilepsy. Approximately 30% of seizures cannot be controlled by medication, and uncontrolled seizures are the primary risk factor for SUDEP. The exact cause of SUDEP is unknown, but laryngospasm has been proposed as a potential cause; therefore, there is a need for research to explore the causes of laryngospasm. Researchers at Purdue University have developed research into the causes of laryngospasms and its link with epilepsy. This research confirmed that sudden death due to laryngospasm in the kainic acid model of epilepsy is always preceded by a certain mechanism, and a method to eliminate sudden death has also been developed. This knowledge may inform future research into sudden death epilepsy and may contribute to the hypothesis that has been presented. This mechanism may be important in other mechanisms of sudden death.Advantages: -Elimination of SUDEP-Inform future research-Important for other mechanisms of sudden deathPotential Applications: -SUDEP-Layngospasm"
Novel Gene Delivery Method,"In the current versions of bovine adenoviral vector system, only .6 kb deletion of the E1 region can be made in the bovine cell line.  Various versions of less prevalent human adenoviral vectors are tested for gene delivery and vaccine production.  The problem with these current versions is that they do not provide the best immune responses.  They are also not as efficient as they could be.  There is a need for a new technology that allows for better responses and increases the efficiency of adenoviral vector mediated gene delivery.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that supports the replication of bovine adenoviral vector with full E1 region deleted.  This allows foreign gene cassette capacity in the bovine adenoviral vector to be extended by 2kb.  Such deletion would allow for a much greater insert capacity of the foreign gene cassette containing one or more genes.  This new technology could potentially open the door for many new technologies pertaining to adenoviral vector mediated gene delivery and vaccine production.Advantages: -Provides better responses-More efficientPotential Applications: -Gene delivery-Adenoviral vectors-Gene therapy"
GaPpIX Conjugates Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy,Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common bacteria in the nose and on the skin of people and animals.  Is it often resistant to many common antibiotics and normally stays in the infected person's body.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to cure MRSA completely.  Current solutions use photosensitizers that cross cell membranes.  This way in ineffective and still leaves the MRSA bacteria in the infected person's body.  There is a need for a new technology that could potentially improve on the treatment of MRSA.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a drug that can be used against multidrug-resistant strains of MRSA.  This is done by using GaPpIX as a photosensitizer that can be targeted to CSHR-expressing bacteria for aPDI.  This IC50 of GaPpIX is well above 10 uM.  This GaPpIX is also much more potent than TMPyP in a head to head comparison.  This new drug could open the door for how treating MRSA is approached in the future. Advantages: -More potent than TMPyP-Anti microbial activity 60 uM or 0.06 uM Potential Applications: -Anthrax-Skin Infections
Liposomal Formulation of Combinational Antibiotics,Liposomal formulations have been developed for single drugs such as ciprofloxacin but not for combinational antibiotics. Liposomal formulations have shown significant less irritation to the respiratory tract and much better safety in previous clinical trials. Developing liposomal formulations for combinational antibiotics might be beneficial for the treatment of respiratory infections.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new liposomal formulation of combinational antibiotics for the treatment of respiratory infections. This new formulation incorporates two synergistic antibiotics to enable maximum bacteria killing against resistant pathogens while significantly reducing irritation to the respiratory tract.Advantages: -Maximum bacteria killing against resistant pathogens-Reduce resistance developmentPotential Applications: -Treatment of respiratory infections-Eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Martina: A Breastfeeding Simulation System,"Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce diabetes, obesity, and respiratory infections.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that mother's breastfeed their babies for six months.  Today, only 11.9 percent of babies are breastfed for this long. The main reason for this is mothers feel discomfort during breastfeeding.  Sore breasts and bleeding nipples are causing mothers to stop breastfeeding early and use formula.  Using formula is also a financial burden.  By breastfeeding, families could save $1200 to $1500 over the six month period.  There is a need for a way for mothers to properly learn how to breastfeed.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that can teach mothers the correct technique of breastfeeding to avoid the discomfort.  This technology is a breastfeeding simulation that gives mothers a realistic training session on the proper techniques of it.  It can teach them the proper way to hold the baby, proper orientation in which the baby should be held, and other important aspects that will reduce the discomfort to the nursing mother.  This simulation is hands on, providing a realistic baby and breast prosthetic for the mothers to practice using.  This system gives feedback, allowing the mother to adjust her technique until she gets it correct.  This technology could change how mothers approach breastfeeding. Advantages: -Hands-on training-Realistic simulation-Teaches correct technique Potential Applications: -Breastfeeding-Nursing mothers"
Antibacterial Agents Against Methicillin- and Vancomycin-Resistant Bacteria,"The discovery and development of antibiotics revolutionized health care in such a way that bacterial infections, which were otherwise deadly, could be treated; however, this was met with a rapid development of resistant bacterial strains that rendered many antibiotics ineffective. Consequently, millions of people are infected with drug-resistant bacterial strains yearly resulting in thousands of deaths. Efforts need to be directed towards identifying and developing novel structures as antibacterial agents with possibly novel mechanisms of action.Researchers at Purdue University have identified compounds with potent antibacterial activities. The most potent compounds inhibited growth of various-resistant Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Some compounds were active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA and VRSA respectively), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). Through resistance generation experiments it was revealed that MRSA could not develop resistance to one of these compounds.Advantages: -Compounds can kill methicillin and vancomycin-resistant bacteria-No resistance from MRSA-Potent activity against drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens	Potential Applications: -Pharmaceuticals/biotech companies-Animal medicine-Bacterial burden in skin wound infectionsRelated Publications:Clement Opoku-Temeng et al., N-(1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzamide analogs, bacteriostatic agents against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant bacteriaEuropean Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2018https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.06.023"
"Live Cell Conjugation Chemistry for Imaging, Sensing, Biomanufacturing, and Cell Therapy","Surface modification of live cells has many biomedical and therapeutic applications, such as live cell imaging and cell therapy. The current approaches have limitations including poor stability over time and incompatibility with mammalian cells due to toxicity. There is a need for a new technology that improves surface modification of live cells. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology that enables surface modification of live mammalian cells. This cell-modification technology has applications in live cell imaging, manufacturing of cell therapies, enhancement of cells for therapeutic applications, cell-drug conjugation for enhanced killing of cancer cells, and drug delivery in a pH dependent manner to sites of inflammation. This technology conjugates small molecules, proteins, fluorophores, and PET tracers to live cells without nanoparticles or other vehicles.Advantages: -Conjugation to cell membranes without killing cells -Functionalizes living cells with components such as small molecules, proteins, fluorophores, and PET tracers -No use of nanoparticles or other vehicles Potential Applications: -Cell membrane imaging -Enhanced cell therapy-Production of therapeutic cells"
Bioactive Glass-Polymer Bone Regeneration,"A broken bone unable to heal on its own is considered to have experienced a critical size defect; 5 to 10 percent of breaks fall into this category. The use of one's own bone tissue is currently the best available option, except it requires two surgeries, the material available is limited, and there is a risk of donor-site morbidity. The other option is to use bone tissue from a donor or a cadaver; these offer more material, but there is a risk of disease transmission, reduction of osteoinductive properties, and lack of osteogenic cellular components. In addition, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are sometimes used to improve osteoinductivity, but these proteins have a short half-life and must be added in supraphysiological doses. Without BMPs, there is a risk of ectopic bone formation. There is a need for a safer, more beneficial approach to bone regeneration.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology for healing bone defects using bioactive silicate glass (BSG) and a 3D osteomimetic composite porous scaffold containing microspheres comprised of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). Unlike other bioactive glasses which increase local pH, this demonstrates fast dissolution and ion release without impacting local pH; in addition, this BSG also contains higher calcium and phosphorous content. The beneficial mechanical properties of PLGA are combined with the bioactivity of the BSG, introducing the possibility of BSGs replacing autografts, allografts, and BMPs.Advantages: -Requires fewer surgeries-Displays minimal risk for disease transmission-Retains the osteoinductive properties-Retains the osteoinductive cellular components-Eliminates the need for BMPsPotential Applications: -Bone regeneration-Fixing critical size bone defects-Elimination of ectopic bone formation"
Athletic Performance Insole Sensor,"Many non-contact sports injuries occur due to limited capabilities in measuring reaction forces on the foot. Force plates, the current method of three dimensional (3D) measurement, restrict athletes to lab environments; while both shear and normal force can be measured in this setting, the devices are too large and bulky to be practical for athletes in their everyday environment. Wearable, non-intrusive devices are only able to measure pressure and therefore neglect all shear forces. No sensor currently exists that can measure 3D forces at the foot without being obtrusive to the user. There is a need for a sensor that can measure both normal and shear forces on the foot while being practical in daily applications. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an insole sensor to provide a practical method of measuring the full range of forces on the foot. The insoles can be substituted into shoes to be non-intrusive to the user and be used during daily activities. In addition, the insoles encompass the sensor electronics to ensure resistance to elements such as water, dust, and wear. The versatility of this solution allows it to be used in any type of shoe depending on the intended sport. Trainers would likely use the sensor to measure athletic performance and understand ways to avoid non-contact injury.  Advantages: -Measures full range of forces-Versatile-Non-intrusive-Water/dust/wear resistantPotential Applications: -Analyze athletic performance-Non-contact injury prevention"
Arylnapthalene Vacuolar-ATPase Inhibitors,"Ebola and Marburg viruses are a filamentous RNA virus that causes severe hemorrhagic fevers.  Recovery from these viruses relies fully on the patient's immune response, because currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine or medicine available to the public yet.  These viruses are deadly and there is a need for a vaccine or some type of medicine that can treat these viruses better than what is available now. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a potential drug treatment for virus infections including Ebola and Marburg.  This technology relies on selective inhibition of virus entry by a chemotype that inhibits the host vacuolar-ATPase.  This will allow for the inhibition of the viral cell.  This technology also allows for the inhibition of a host protein which will be key in treating these two viruses, because protein is needed for the viruses to achieve infection and replication.  This new technology could open the door for how Ebola and Marburg are treated.Advantages: -Inhibition of the viral cell-Inhibition of a hostPotential Applications: -Viral entry-Antiviral agents"
Wearable Device for Monitoring Health/Activity Levels,"Existing wearable technology for monitoring activity also monitors heart rates using plethysmography; however, such technology cannot detect respiration or blood oxygenation levels from plethysmograph or from the wrist. Photoplethysmography uses an LED and photodiode to measure reflected light through human tissue. Existing heart monitors and pulse oximetry sensors worn on the finger use photoplethysmography; however, respiration and pulse oximetry have not been performed on the wrist nor is respiration detected from a finger. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a wearable device, i.e., watch, that detects respiration rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation using photoplethysmography. All physiologic measurements are obtained in a single, easy-to-access device that is worn on the wrist. In addition, it can monitor exercise and disease states, such as drug overdose, asthma, seizure, or other health issues, affecting respiration, heart rate, and/or oxygen saturation. In addition, this device calls for emergency response when a drug overdose is detected, breathing/heart rate stops, and/or oxygen saturation drops below an acceptable threshold. This technology makes advances beyond the popular wearable watch that monitors activity, by using technology that monitors an individual's physiologic state and disease state and calls for emergency response.Advantages: -Wearable on wrist-Physiologic measurements-Monitors and detects drug overdose and disease states affecting respiration, heart rate, and/or oxygen saturation -Calls for emergency response-Potential integration with existing technologyPotential Applications: -Monitor health/activity-Detects respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation -Detects drug overdose"
Accelerated Degradation of Pharmaceuticals and Related Chemical Processes,"Forced degradation is an accelerated method of studying the stability of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in order to predict the shelf life of the drug. Forced degradation studies of APIs are an important aspect of pharmaceutical development. Typical forced degradation methods take one to seven days to complete and are then followed with product analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). These methods are time consuming and costly. There is a need for a more efficient method of forced degradation.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new forced degradation method.  Using Leidenfrost droplets to accelerate forced degradation and nanospray mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize the reaction products, the reaction/analysis sequence provided results within minutes, i.e., five minutes, versus taking up to a week to complete. The FDA requires forced degradation for licensing, which causes a bottleneck in pharmaceutical production. An accelerated forced degradation method could help eliminate this bottleneck.Advantages: -Faster-More efficient-Reliable-Potential to speed up FDA licensing processPotential Applications: -Pharmaceutical industry-Drug development"
Enhanced Drug Delivery Across Epithelial Barrier,"One of the most common practices of drug delivery is by the oral route. However, overcoming the gastrointestinal epithelial barriers is the major challenge for efficient delivery of drugs. Besides the intracellular route or passive diffusion, the paracellular route can be exploited by using a bacterial peptide for enhanced delivery of drugs through the epithelial barrier to reach the underlying lamina propria and submucosal compartment. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an approach for enhanced delivery of drugs through the intestinal epithelial barrier to reach the underlying propria and submucosal compartment. The use of the Listeria adhesion protein (LAP) enhances permeability through the intestinal barrier. This technology would be suitable for enhanced delivery of a variety of drugs across the mucosal epithelial barrier.Advantages: -Enhanced permeability-Improved efficiencyPotential Applications: -Drug delivery-Pharmaceutical companies"
Wearable Biometric to Predict and Prevent Preeclampsia and Hypertension,"Preeclampsia (or pregnancy related hypertension) is the most common complication to occur during pregnancy. It accounts for over $2.18 billion of U.S. health care expenditures in the first 12 months after birth. Of the 131 million pregnancies per year (4 million in the United States), approximately 10 percent are complicated by hypertension, leading to 3 million premature births. New insights suggest compromised blood flow through the kidneys plays a fundamental role in the development of preeclampsia. Researchers at Purdue University are refining a wearable biometric intended to screen for compromised kidney blood flow in 100 percent of pregnant women with the goal of predicting and preventing preeclampsia. Symptoms of preeclampsia can include high blood pressure, protein in the urine, swelling, and seizures. After the 20th week of pregnancy, the mass of the pregnant abdomen is well known to affect kidney blood flow, especially when a woman lies on her back. In women with a vulnerable anatomy, this compromised blood flow leads to high blood pressure. Previously published work has shown that an acute elevation in blood pressure associated with a pregnant woman shifting from her side to her back predicts approximately 90% of preeclampsia. The procedure is known as the supine pressure test (SPT). Furthermore, when detected early, rest in a therapeutic position, on one's side for example, has been shown to prevent preeclampsia. Purdue University researchers have developed a wearable biometric intended to both predict preeclampsia and better manage those women identified to be at risk. The technology couples a blood pressure measuring device with a body position sensor to ensure meticulous execution of the SPT. The device transmits via smartphone the changes in blood pressure and calculated predictive risk to a remote medical location. Sequential testing is intended to optimize test sensitivity. For those women identified to be at risk, the wearable device is also programmed to monitor a pregnant woman's resting position and communicate with her as needed to optimize position. The goal is to better predict and prevent preeclampsia and to allow expecting mothers to monitor their own health without frequent travel to a clinic.Advantages:-Predicts, manages, or prevents preeclampsia-Testing performed in the comfort of home-Results transmit to remote medical professionals-Affordable-PortablePotential Applications: -Early detection and prevention of preeclampsia-Reduce the number of premature births resulting from preeclampsia-Allow expecting mothers to monitor their own blood pressure without traveling to a clinic for frequent monitoring-Similar application available for those with obesity-related hypertension, since physiology has been shown to be similar. U.S. hypertensive population is 76 million."
Performing Human Movement Assessments Using Video Game Technology,"Commercial motion capture systems now offer systems that require no instrumentation and allow movement tracking without having to use markers or tracking suits. However, these systems are prohibitively expensive, require technical expertise, take up a large volume of space, and often require the analysis of movements by users before outcome measures are available. In general, this technology is not widely adopted in the clinical field despite some advantages over commercial motion capture systems that require instrumentation. The high cost, low portability, and required expertise associated with commercial motion capture systems frequently used in human movement research, does not afford its use in clinical settings.In general, physical and occupational therapists use visual inspection of posture or movement or handheld goniometers to assess patients in a clinical environment. Unfortunately, this limits a clinician's ability to incorporate more comprehensive examinations of posture and gait that may reveal subtle alterations to the underlying health and functional status of the neuromuscular system.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a software application that will serve as a tool for clinicians to measure and monitor body movements using an affordable, portable device, the Microsoft Kinect*. The application's design allows physical and occupational therapists to supplement movement assessments with more comprehensive metrics than currently available. In addition, features, such as longitudinal tracking of patient progress, will provide clinicians the opportunity to view how their patients are progressing under their current regimen. The proposed technology will provide an affordable interface for clinicians to carry out rigorous examinations of a patient's movement without adding significant time to their visit or diverting time away from their rehabilitation regimen. Advantages:-Uses existing technology-Affordable-Portable -Easy to use-Simultaneous evaluationsPotential Applications:-Physical and occupational therapists-Clinical evaluations-Therapy progression*Trademark"
Determination of IsoAspartate in a Peptide,"In vitro and in vivo isomerization of aspartate (Asp) to isoaspartate (isoAsp) is one of the main routes to protein degradation. Deamidation of asparagine (Asn) can also yield isoAsp via a common succinimide intermediate. Not only can this transformation change the structure and activity of a protein, it can also lead to immunological response. Furthermore, an increase in endogenous isoAsp has been linked to Alzheimer's disease and aging. The body naturally produces enzymes that work to reduce the levels of isoAsp, namely PIMT and PCMT, both of which methylate isoAsp to encourage isomerization to Asp. The spontaneous, post-translational generation of isoAsp poses an immediate problem to the development of protein-bound pharmaceuticals, where shelf life and activity may be directly affected; in fact, isoAsp generation is one of the most common contributors to heterogeneity in a protein-bound drug. Factors that induce the generation of isoAsp include pH, secondary and tertiary protein structure, and formulation. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a fast and inexpensive method to determine isoaspartate by chemical derivatization in the backbones of peptides by ionizing labeled peptides. This method is the simplest and most accessible assay for isoAsp determination, which makes it useful to researchers studying its link to disease or drug-bioconjugate degradation.  Advantages: -Fast -Inexpensive-Easily accessiblePotential Applications: -Research related to isoAsp's link to disease or drug-bioconjugate degradation-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical industry"
Mask Coupling Apparatus for Securing a Mask to a Helmet,"Traditionally, a user who needs to wear both a mask and a helmet will wear the mask straps over their head with a helmet worn over-top of the straps. This requires that the helmet be removed to adjust the straps. Additionally the adjustment mechanisms are sliding tables, which are difficult to adjust when worn in the field, particularly when wearing gloves. As a result, the adjustment of masks is difficult and time-consuming. Users have suffered with the adjustment mechanisms causing discomfort such as pressure points and headaches from poor fitting equipment.NSWC Crane has developed and patented a coupling apparatus for attaching a mask to a helmet with easier adjustments for fit while in the field. The coupling method reduces fatigue because there are fewer contact points with the mask wearer. The quick release buckle allows the wearer to detach one side of the respirator."
Smartphone Application Measures Postural Sway,"Postural sway controls the body's weight distribution around its center of mass. Its deviation from normal can be a symptom of a variety of neuromuscular and vestibular disorders. Despite the importance of sway assessment, current technologies used to collect these movements are either too expensive and/or too difficult for the general public to operate outside of a lab environment. Wearable devices that measure human movement can enable daily sway assessment using inexpensive and easier to use sensors.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a mobile system based on a widely available platform (smartphones) and a custom-designed image processing software for human movement and sway assessment. This is a low cost, easy-to-use design that is portable and provides accurate assessments. Older adults, athletes, and others suffering from balance disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, can use this technology. An additional use includes as a screening tool for concussion and/or traumatic brain injury for both athletes and military personnel. It offers the advantages of daily measurement by the end-user. Advantages: -Easy-to-use-Low cost-Accurate-Daily measurementsPotential Applications: -Older adults-Balance disorders such as Parkinson's disease-Screening tool for concussions and/or traumatic brain injury for both athletes and military personnel"
Multidrug-Resistant HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors,"According to the Centers for Disease Control, an estimated 1.2 million people in the United States live with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 1 in 7 are unaware that they have it. HIV is a virus that weakens the immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. There is currently no cure for HIV, but it can be controlled. If HIV is not treated, the virus can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS usually occurs in the last stage of HIV when the development of cancer and other diseases take advantage of the weakened immune system. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the most effective treatment for HIV. Unfortunately, drug side effects and the emergence of drug resistance have reduced the effectiveness of ART.Researchers at Purdue University have developed new compounds that have been shown to maintain potency against multidrug-resistant HIV variants. These compounds are novel protease inhibitors, but unlike current protease inhibitor drugs, these compounds bind to the protease backbone very tightly, exhibiting improved drug resistance. Many inhibitors in the current series have shown exceedingly potent enzyme inhibitory and antiviral potency. This class of inhibitors may exhibit much improved pharmacological properties compared to darunavir and other FDA approved inhibitors. Advantages: -Increased antiviral potency-Potent enzyme inhibitor-Improved pharmacological properties-Maintains potency against multidrug-resistant HIV variantsPotential Applications: -Pharmaceuticals-Treatment option for HIV/AIDS and specifically for multidrug-resistant HIV variants -Medical/Health"
Simultaneous Treatment of Alcohol Use and Psychiatric Disorders,"Alcohol use disorder is a chronic relapsing condition that includes alcohol withdrawal syndrome and is frequently comorbid with chronic pain disorders and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. There are only a few drugs approved to treat alcohol use disorder. Their only goal is to reduce alcohol cravings. They do not treat psychiatric disorders. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new technology for treating alcohol use disorder. In addition to targeting reduced alcohol intake, it simultaneously treats depression. This new treatment is meant to help patients suffering from both alcohol use and psychiatric disorders. This treatment should exhibit much fewer side effects and improved efficacy when compared to currently available treatments. Advantages:-Simultaneously treats alcohol use and psychiatric disorders-Exhibits fewer side effects -Improved efficacyPotential Applications: -Patients suffering from both alcohol use and psychiatric disorders-Alcohol treatment centers-Hospitals"
Improved Nanoparticle Based Targeted Drug Delivery to Cancerous Cells and Tissues,"Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth. Currently there are more than 100 types of identified cancer that affect human beings as well as animals. In 2016, there were an estimated 1,685,210 new human cancer cases diagnosed and 595,690 cancer deaths in the United States alone (Cancer Statistics 2016 - American Cancer Society, Inc.). Nanoparticles (NPs) have been considered a promising carrier of chemotherapeutic drugs, but are limited in delivery to tumors due to the diverse nature of the disease. There currently exists the need to leverage the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deliver NPs beyond the current levels possible.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for preparing polyol-modified nanoparticles for targeted delivery to cancerous cells and tissues via transcytosis across the peritumoral endothelium. This method does not depend on the leakiness of the vasculature like traditional nanoparticle formulations, but actively interacts with the vascular lining to enter tumors.Advantages:-Increases the amount of drugs deliver to solid tumors-Reduces the required dose and related side effects-Does not depend on long-term circulation and passive extravasationPotential Applications:-Cancer treatment-Drug deliveryRelated Publication:Quinic Acid-Conjugated Nanoparticles Enhance Drug Delivery to Solid Tumors via Interactions with Endothelial SelectinsSmall 14 (50), 1803601DOI: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.201803601"
Diffusive Optical Imaging of Arteries and Lesions in the Mouth for Assisting Oral Surgery ,"The greater palatine artery (GPA) is an anatomical landmark for oral surgery. Currently, a surgeon must rely on prior knowledge of the GPA location to avoid damaging it or surrounding nerves. Unfortunately, studies suggest that there can be a discrepancy of up to 4 mm and this uncertainty can cause a variety of surgical complications and injuries. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method to image arteries and lesions in the roof of the mouth. The technology described uses the contrast in optical properties between the arteries or lesions and the surrounding tissue to locate the GPA and lesions that are not visible to the naked eye. This allows for their exact location and depth to be computationally identified. In addition, researchers can print images of the artery on a surface mask that covers only the regions of tissue above the artery, providing surgeons a guide to areas of the mouth to avoid.  Custom surgical tools of limited length that could not damage the artery can be printed.Advantages:-Reduces likelihood of artery and nerve damage-Computationally identifies the exact location and depth of the GPAPotential Applications:-Custom surgical tools-Oral surgery"
Energy Efficient Electrode Design to Treat Neurological Disorders,"Numerous neurological impairments, including neuromotor deficit, hearing loss, chronic pain, and epilepsy, require the restoration and replacement of bodily functions by virtue of implantable neuroprosthetic devices. Advancements in neuroscience have increased the total market size considerably for various neural stimulation devices that target the spinal cord, cochlear, cerebral cortex, and other peripheral nerves. With advances in neurostimulation technologies, the demand for more precise targeting of neural substrate has fueled the development of higher density electrode arrays to improve the resolution of stimulation outcomes while minimizing unwanted side effects; however, chronic overstimulation is known to cause nerve damage. There is a need for developing higher efficiency, more durable electrodes.Researchers at Purdue University have developed new electrode designs to prolong the lifetime and function efficacy of implantable pulse generators. It was found that certain shapes can be used to more efficiently deliver electrical charge for stimulating the nervous system. Data shows that the electrode design reduces power consumption by up to 50 percent while increasing functionality effectiveness. This new electrode design could be used in implantable simulation systems that are used to treat a large number of neurological disorders. It will work in existing platforms or in a standalone system. Advantages: -Energy efficient-Increases lifetime of system-Increases functionality effectiveness-Compatible with existing platformsPotential Applications: -Implantable neuroprosthetic devices-Implantable pulse generators-Other implantable devices"
Synthetic Mimics of Malonyl-CoA as Fatty Acid Synthase Inhibitors,"Fatty acids are essential components of overall cellular metabolism. Malonyl-CoA is a coenzyme known to play a key role in the synthesis of fatty acids. Inhibition of malonyl-CoA results in defects in the biosynthesis of fatty acid. Development of such specialized inhibitors have applications in medicine. Therefore, there is a need, especially in medicine, for specialized inhibitors.Researchers at Purdue University, with various manipulations of malonyl-CoA, developed synthesized molecules that inhibit enzymes related to fatty acid synthases. These inhibitions may be the solution to treating bacterial infections, cancer, and obesity related diseases. These inhibitors are unique in that they can be modified to inhibit fatty acid metabolism in a specific organism. Advantages: -One inhibitor has the potential to treat bacterial infections, cancer, and obesity related diseases-Custom modification for single organismsPotential Applications: -Treating drug-resistant bacteria-Cancer treatment-Treating obesity related disease"
Muscle Progenitor Cells  Enhance Innervation,"Denervation, the loss of nerve supply in muscle fibers, occurs from a variety of causes ranging from serious physical injury to chronic disorders. This disruption in nerve fibers may cause flaccid paralysis, eventually leading to severe muscle atrophy. Following a major injury that results in denervation, the physical muscle tissue may heal, but without an adequate, functioning nervous system connection, no effective physical movement can be made. Research in this area has shown that if the damage is contained to certain nerves, the brain might rewire neurological circuitry and resume somewhat normal function. Unfortunately, in cases of muscle denervation, effective physical muscle movement cannot naturally be reversed.  A Purdue University researcher has developed a toolkit and a method for repairing and reconstructing a damaged or nonfunctional muscle using in vitro primed muscle progenitor cells to promote innervation of the damaged or nonfunctional muscle without any genetic manipulation. Muscle progenitor cells are harvested and grown to a critical mass in culture. The cells are then injected into the damaged or nonfunctional muscle and fuse with native muscle fiber. Following the injection, the muscle is innervated, atrophy has been shown to reverse, and the muscle fibers have an increased force of contraction.Advantages:-Does not use genetically modified cells-Allows the body to naturally regrow nerve connections-Clinically translatablePotential Applications-Innervation-Muscle repair-Tissue engineering"
Compounds with Promising Antibacterial and Antifungal Activity for New Therapeutic Development,"Invasive fungal infections are a serious cause of mortality in many patients including an increasing number of immunocompromised patients. Few treatment choices exist and first-line therapies have significant limitations due to safety problems and the lack of broad-spectrum activity. There is a need for novel antibacterial/antifungal agents and efficient methods of making these agents. Researchers at Purdue University have identified several compounds with novel structures that indicate promising antibacterial and antifungal activity. Researchers evaluated the compounds against important bacterial, yeast, and mold pathogens. Preliminary results demonstrated promising activity against toxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile. The compounds did not show a side effect on beneficial intestinal microflora and were nontoxic. Researchers are currently preparing analogues of the antibacterial and antifungal lead compounds to improve potency and physicochemical properties for new therapeutic development.Advantages: -Efficient -No effect on beneficial intestinal microflora-NontoxicPotential Applications: -Pharmaceuticals-Drug development-Treatment for fungal and bacterial infections"
Rope Climbing Machine for Exercise and Strength Training,"The U.S. Navy seeks a partner for licensing and collaboration on a rope climbing method for use in compact space without enough height to install a traditional climbing rope. Traditional rope climbing requires 20ft or more of height to provide any real exercise or training when climbing. Often it is not practical to install a rope in a gym or training facility due to high constraints. Additionally, it is a safety hazard to have inexperienced climbers at that height without harnesses and safety lines. There are some existing rope climbing machines, but they require supported positions and/or power outlets. NSWC Crane has developed and patented a rope climbing machine with a continuous rope and a variable braking system that can be used for fully suspended rope climbing technique practice and exercise. The machine can be used in a room with standard ceiling heights which prevents the necessity of having extra safety measures. The variable braking systems allows the speed to be customized for individual users."
Diagnostic Panel of Modified Proteins for Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women in the U.S. and Europe and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American women. Early intervention and treatment will produce healthier, more successful outcomes for patients. Diagnostic markers are important for prognosis, diagnosis, and monitoring disease and changes in health status. Diagnostic markers are important for predicting and monitoring response to treatment and selecting appropriate treatment. Identifying these health issues accurately is extremely important for correct treatment.  Improved diagnostics would greatly improve the health of these women. Unfortunately, there are currently no effective biomarkers reported that can differentiate between a benign or malignant breast lesion or tumor that has been visually detected by an imaging method.   Researchers at Purdue University have developed a diagnostic panel of modified proteins for breast cancer. The breast cancer diagnosis may be a determination of whether a breast tissue lesion or tumor is benign or malignant. The diagnostic breast cancer panel provides a method for diagnosing a malignant tumor based on a blood test. Using this diagnostic method as a screening test is a promising advancement for people who are susceptible to developing breast cancer, need periodic monitoring after surgery, or possess a high genetic risk for the disease. Early diagnosis and identification of the disease and changes in health status may permit earlier intervention and treatment that will produce healthier, more successful outcomes for patients.Advantages:-Breast cancer diagnostic markers-Distinguishes between benign or malignant tumors and skin lesions-Early diagnosis may permit earlier intervention and treatmentPotential Applications:-Breast cancer screening test-Breast cancer diagnostic test-Monitor treatment effectivenessRelated Publications:Chen, I-Hsuan, et al. Phosphoproteins in Extracellular Vesicles as Candidate Markers for Breast Cancer. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 2017, 114 (12), pp 3175-3180.

Novel Conformationally Constrained Memapsin 2 Inhibitors for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"The processing of a precursor protein by memapsin 2 (beta-secretase, BACE 1) is the first step in the pathway leading to the production of Alzheimer's disease-causing amyloid-beta; thus, it is a major target for the development of inhibitor drugs used in the treatment of this disease.  A Purdue University researcher has designed a series of novel memapsin 2 inhibitors that incorporate conformationally constrained cyclic amine derivatives in place of conventional hydroxyethylamine isostere-derived inhibitors.  These inhibitors' design improves pharmacological properties of drug forms, improving metabolic stability, oral bioavailability, and in vivo A-reductions. 	Advantages:-Improved pharmacological propertiesPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical industry"
Smart Contact Lens for Therapeutic Applications,"Soft contact lenses could offer an ideal platform for a broad range of devices ranging from medical devices offering ocular pain relief or drug delivery to augmented reality. Unfortunately, until recently, any combination of soft contact lenses with sensors, actuators, or any other semiconductor technology was not possible because current semiconductor processing requires a rigid, planar surface, which is not compatible with the soft, curved shape of a contact lens.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method for attaching sensors and other small devices to the soft, curved, silicone-based structure of a soft contact lens. This cutting-edge technology utilizes semiconducting nanomaterials, as well as metallic and insulating traces, to serve as a thermal actuator, a wireless power supply, and an array of sensors. Purdue researchers have used this new therapeutic contact lens system to unclog meibomian glands, the primary cause of dry eye syndrome, via the controlled application of heat to the clogged ducts. With the ability to combine soft, silicon-based contact lenses with a variety of different semiconductor devices, numerous advanced eye care applications are now possible. Advantages:-Noninvasive-Appears to be a standard contact to an observer-Improved eye carePotential Applications:-Treatment of dry eye syndrome-Augmented reality-Flexible ocular medication platform"
Humanlike Smart Electronic Gloves for Prosthetic and Robotic Controls ,"There are approximately 2 million people in the United States that have undergone an amputation and thus require a prosthetic, with an estimated 185,000 new amputees every year (Advanced Amputee Solutions LLC). Prosthetic development has advanced over the past 10 years, but there still remains many issues with the current generation of prosthetics. The advancement of prosthetic hands is of particular concern given the importance of social touch such as handshake, gentle strokes and pats, and even high fives. Disfigurement of the hands affects psychological well-being. Current prosthetic hands allow for artificial skin, but complex geometries lead to poor mechanical/electrical couplings, limiting humanlike social touch.A Purdue University researcher has developed an electronic glove (e-glove) in which various commercial gloves can serve as a platform for functional sensors. It can work with existing prosthetic hands by utilizing their intrinsic ergonomic designs.  In addition, the e-glove incorporates the mechanical softness and physical warmth to replicate humanlike social touch. Advantages:-Simple solution-Fits all prosthetic hands-Improved humanlike social touchPotential Applications:-Prosthetic hand improvement-Assistive robotic hand improvement-General prosthetic development"
Biosensor for Detecting Viscosity Changes,"When pharmaceutical preparations are improperly stored, drug safety and efficacy need to be monitored to ensure that the pharmaceutic delivers its intended effect and to prevent potential illness from degraded product. Current screening platforms for the stability of protein-based biopharmaceuticals in high throughput and low volume are unavailable outside of production and quality control laboratories. Miniaturized platforms for analyzing biopharmaceutical degradation could provide significant advantages to current macroscale systems. These include the ability to assess the quality of a pharmaceutical either during development, at distribution points, at the clinic, or within patient homes. Researchers at Purdue University have developed and designed miniaturized platforms for analyzing biopharmaceutical degradation. This technology provides significant advantages to current macroscale systems and allows for rapid testing of pharmaceuticals outside of the quality control laboratory using small sample volumes. The method has been proven with several different biopharmaceutical formulations and can discriminate as little as 5 percent degradation of insulin in a solution. This technology is a new tool for biopharmaceutical analysis and could readily be implemented at key points of the pharmaceutical delivery chain. Advantages:-Requires only a small sample to test-Eliminates the need for lab testing-Eliminates waste by discriminating degraded vs. intact product-Eliminates risk of using inactive biopharmaceutical for patientsPotential Applications:-Insulin testing-Biopharmaceutical efficacy tests"
Enhanced Imaging Using Vibrational Photoacoustic Tomography ,"Atherosclerosis is a degenerative disease that causes plaque accumulation in the arterial wall that can eventually inhibit blood flow to various tissues and organs. Patients may experience pain when walking and decreased wound healing, which can lead to amputation. In more serious conditions, plaques can rupture, leading to a blood clot that can induce a stroke or heart attack. Aneurysms, on the other hand, occur when the artery wall weakens causing the vessel to bulge. Aneurysms may remain silent or rupture, causing internal bleeding and even death. Diagnosing, treating, and managing atherosclerotic-related diseases represent a significant cost to society. Established methods of diagnosing and monitoring atherosclerosis have limitations such has high cost, long imaging times, and may be minimally invasive. Atherosclerosis-related diseases also have high recurrence rate of between 10 and 20 percent during the first 12 months after treatment. Taken together, these unmet clinical problems suggest that better imaging techniques are needed to cost effectively monitor atherosclerosis progression before, during, and after therapeutic and surgical interventions.Vibrational Photoacoustic Tomography (VPAT) is an emerging imaging method that utilizes pulsed laser light to induce acoustic waves and obtain tissue-specific compositional information. When used in combination with ultrasound, VPAT has the potential to identify the location, size, and distribution of lipids in vivo. This is especially important in atherosclerosis diagnosis, as better techniques are needed to identify and characterize plaques in high-risk and asymptomatic patients. Researchers from Purdue University have developed a photoacoustic probe that allows for improved imaging of tissue. This technology has the ability to rapidly, non-invasively, and cost effectively locate and quantify plaque composition in vivo. VPAT has the potential to be used in the clinic to study atherosclerosis plaque development, evaluate the effectiveness of prospective therapeutics, and improve the diagnosis of atherosclerosis or related vascular diseases.Advantages:-Disease tracking-Does not require contrast agents-Rapid in vivo imaging capabilities-Potential for 3D imaging-Estimated cost is lower than conventional imaging techniquesPotential Applications:-Therapeutic research-Diagnosis of atherosclerosis or related vascular diseases-Determine treatment options"
Synthetic Lung Surfactant for Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) causes nearly 40 percent of premature infant deaths worldwide. A lack of natural surfactant in their under-developed lungs is the initial cause of RDS. Treatment is not readily available for RDS in developing countries because conventional surfactant replacement therapy uses animal-derived surfactants that are costly to produce, must be carefully stored, and require highly trained practitioners to perform a sophisticated delivery procedure.Researchers from Purdue University have developed a synthetic polymer-based surfactant to treat RDS by supplementing the premature infant's naturally produced surfactants. The synthetic lung surfactant, proven effective by in vitro measurements using a lung-mimetic device, will be less expensive to produce and store and will not require delivery by skilled physicians. This simple, cost effective surfactant is a promising treatment to decrease the mortality rate of premature infants worldwide.Advantages: -Less costly to produce and store-Less variation in production versus current animal-derived surfactant-Treatment option for developing countries Potential Applications: -Respiratory distress syndrome"
Skin-Mounted Sweat Sensor,"The state of hydration in humans is a delicate physiological parameter with direct effects on body function at the cellular, organic, and systemic levels. Studies have shown that deviations as small as 2 percent lower than normal can reduce cognitive and physical performance by more than 30 percent. Unfortunately, monitoring and maintaining hydration can be difficult. Methods of analyzing these levels vary between serum ion concentration, urine color, and body mass. Body mass and urine analysis are the more conventional techniques, but lack accuracy due to measurement shortcomings. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a colorimetric dermal patch that measures human hydration by collecting and measuring sweat secretion over small areas of skin. Since most water loss in humans occurs via sweat, this method provides the most accurate analysis of hydration. The device consists of an inexpensive, laser-patterned filter paper sandwiched between two medical grade films, OpSite*. The filter paper contains a water-activated dye that provides an identifiable color change depending on moisture loss from small areas of skin. It is user friendly and easily identifies levels of moisture loss. Advantages:-Accurate-Inexpensive-User friendlyPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Athletics-Cosmetics -Military"
Cold Atmospheric Plasma Device Driven by DC Voltage,"Non-equilibrium atmospheric plasma jets (NEAPJ) are widely used in the fields of sterilization and disinfection without chemical damage to tissue, minimally-invasive surgery, cancer treatment, drug delivery, wound healing, cellular modifications, bioengineering, dermatology, cosmetics, etc. Conventional NEAPJ uses AC voltage or pulsed DC power supplies, which cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) and high ground leakage currents. There is a need for an NEAPJ without such problems.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new device for generating cold plasma jets that uses pure DC voltage as opposed to AC voltage or pulsed DC power devices. Using a pure DC voltage reduces the problems caused by EMI, such as problems with medical monitors and medical devices. When EMI causes such devices to malfunction, it puts the patient at risk.Advantages:-Reduces electromagnetic interference and high ground leakage currents-Does not damage tissuePotential Applications:-Sterilization and disinfection of tissue wounds-Medical applications"
Combination of Cholesterol Esterification Inhibitors with Existing Therapies for Cancer Treatment,"Despite recent advancements in cancer treatment, drug resistance remains a major impediment to developing successful control or cure for cancer. Numerous attempts have been made to decipher the mechanisms underlying cancer resistance, but none have attacked the issue regarding the role cholesterol metabolism plays. Purdue University researchers found an unexpected accumulation of cholesteryl ester in aggressive types of cancer. Their research has shown that applying an effective amount of at least one agent to an existing cancer treatment resensitizes the cancer cells to the existing cancer treatment by inhibiting cholesterol esterification pathways. Advantages:-Targets the metabolic pathway to overcome drug resistance-Works in conjunction with existing therapiesPotential Applications:-Cancer treatment-Drug resistance diseases-Therapeutics"
Therapeutic for Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Cancers,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has a five-year survival rate of 25 percent. Patients develop resistance to the current standard AML drug, ara-C, both alone and in combination with other cancer drugs. In AML as well as a number of other cancers, the disease is driven by protein kinases like FLT-3 and TrkC. Another structure implicated in cancer is the G-quadruplex formed through DNA interactions. This biology can be taken advantage of to design a more effective treatment for AML.A Purdue University researcher has developed a series of new compounds that inhibit the FLT-3 and TrkC protein kinases and bind to G-quadruplexes. These compounds display activity in AML cell lines with nanomolar IC50 values. In addition to their effectiveness against cancer cell lines, these compounds have been designed to be metabolically stable. It is anticipated that these compounds will have superior performance against AML compared to the standard treatment. The mechanisms that drive AML also drive many cancers, so these dual protein kinase inhibitors/G-quadruplex binders have broad potential as cancer therapeutics. Advantages: -Potent anticancer agents -Designed to be metabolically stable Potential Applications: -AML therapeutic-Treatment for multiple cancersRelated Publication:Identification of new FLT3 inhibitors that potently inhibit AML cell lines, via an azo cllick-it/staple-it approach.

Facile Expression and Purification of USP17 for use in Cancer Drug Discovery,"USP17, a ubiquitin specific enzyme, is responsible for the progression of the cell cycle to promote cellular proliferation. In many cancers, including breast and prostate, USP17 levels are upregulated, promoting unregulated proliferation and cancer. Over the last 10 years, cell-based studies have identified USP17 as a potential target for cancer therapy; however, there has been no advancement in the production of recombinant USP17. Availability of large amounts of purified, recombinant USP17 is critical for developing an anticancer therapeutic against this target.Researchers from Purdue University have developed a methodology for the expression and purification of recombinant USP17, which allows for the utilization of a much wider array of techniques compared to cell based assays. Recombinant USP17 can be used for kinetic, structural, biochemical studies, and other studies of the enzyme and its response to drug candidates. The Purdue researchers' protocol and the resulting recombinant protein provide others with the tools to develop therapeutics against cancers in which USP17 regulation is a major component. This method will help advance the development of anticancer therapeutics that target USP17.Advantages:-Recombinant protein now available-Facilitates drug discoveryPotential Applications:-Drug Discovery-Pharmaceutical industry-Biomedical industry-Biomedical and Pharmaceutical R&D-Medical diagnosis"
Injectable Elastic Polymeric System for Tissue Scaffolds,"Medications are drugs used to treat, cure, prevent, or diagnose an illness or medical condition. However, sometimes drugs are not effective by simply being ingested. Delivery of local or systemic drugs requires targeted doses to specific parts of the body. The accuracy of delivery is often hampered by inferior mechanical performance of the material used for delivery.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a functionalized hyaluronic acid (HA), a thermo-responsive elastic polymer system comprising functionalized HA, and the methods of fabrication and utilization for drug delivery. This polymer system is injectable and may be used for spatio-temporally controlled delivery of analgesics, anesthetics, antibodies, and other drugs as well as growth factors. Controlled drug delivery offers numerous advantages when compared to conventional dosage forms including improved efficacy, reduced toxicity, reduced need for specialized drug administration, and improved patient compliance/convenience. In addition, HA offers numerous useful biological benefits including wound healing, cell adhesion and proliferation, cell motility, angiogenesis, cellular signaling, and matrix organization.Advantages:-Injectable-Thermo-responsive-Highly elastic-Controlled drug deliveryPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Drug delivery-Tissue engineering"
Tissue Engineering Composites,"Tissue decelluarization has been shown as a viable means of tissue regeneration in the face of traumatic injury or degenerative diseases. Articular cartilage defects are resilient to natural repair and subject to high mechanical forces, which can lead to further tissue degeneration. Current microparticle systems require hostile exogenous crosslinking, have little control over the final microparticle density, and do not investigate the contribution of separate cartilage components to the chondrogenic induction and maintenance. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an alternative method of treatment that allows for custom molding of implants, increased porosity between particles for global cell delivery, and relatively small cartilage thicknesses for promoted cell infiltration. This technology uses native tissue and molecules, making it ideal in the application of articular cartilage. Unlike other methods that use synthetic polymer systems or native polymers that can lead to long-term degradation of cartilage, this technology provides dense packing of embedding matrix and cells.Advantages:-Eliminates potential for degradation of tissue after surgeryPotential Applications:-Biomaterials-Surgical components-Surgical technology"
Assistive Movement Device Expedites Recovery of Lower Leg Injuries ,"Studies conducted in 2011 show that approximately 864,000 people suffered from fractures requiring the use of crutches. Of those, approximately 319,000 occurred at or below the knee affecting the ankle, foot, tibia, fibula, and/or knee. It is known that the healing process can be made more efficient by gradually restoring load to an injured limb; however, there are no existing products that provide variable loading throughout the healing process. Therefore, there is a need for an assistive movement device that compliments the optimal recovery process below the knee injuries.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an innovative assistive movement device to aid those affected with lower limb impairments. This technology expedites the recovery process using variable weight adjustability on the injured limb. This device allows users to move freely in their everyday activities without the limitations of normal crutches. The total recovery time is further decreased by encouraging a stronger union through axial compressive dynamization of the limb.Advantages: -Reduces recovery time-Encourages a stronger union through axial compressive dynamization-Allows users to be more mobile during recovery periodPotential Applications: -Medical/Health-Orthopedics-Physical therapy-Lower limb injuries"
Novel Aryl Isonitrile Antimicrobials Active Against Clinically Important Bacterial Strains,"Antibiotics and infectious disease therapy made huge strides in the last century; however, the emergence of resistant strains and superbugs has increased. In the United States alone, 2 million people each year are affected by these infections, resulting in over 23,000 fatalities. Out of these, nearly half are caused by the pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and VRSA) cause a range of diseases including superficial skin infections, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and bloodstream infections. These strains have become resistant to nearly every class of antibiotics, including agents of last resort, such as vancomycin and linezolid.Researchers at Purdue University have identified a novel class of compounds that have an aryl isonitrile moiety that shows potent inhibitory activity against clinically important strains of MRSA and VRSA, Bacillus anthracis, and Listeria monocytogenes. These compounds demonstrate strong antimicrobial activity against MRSA strains that are resistant to numerous antibiotic classes such as penicillins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, lincosamides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. Not only are these compounds potent, they do not show any apparent toxicity against mammalian cells up to a concentration of 64 micrometers, compared to other antibiotics that have a narrow therapeutic to toxic concentration range. In addition, analysis implies that cross-resistance between other antibiotics and these aryl isonitrile compounds is unlikely. Hence, these compounds have the potential for use as future alternatives to other antibiotics for the treatment of resistant strains of MRSA and VRSA in clinical settings.  Advantages:-Potent antimicrobial activity-Minimal toxicity at high concentrations-Effective against resistant strainsPotential Applications:-Pharmaceutical industry-Drug R&D-Alternative antimicrobial therapy-Treatment of antibiotic-resistant strainsRelated Publications:Davis, Dexter C., et al. Discovery and Characterization of Aryl Isonitriles as a New Class of Compounds Versus Methicillin- andVancomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Enhanced Insect Susceptibility to Entomopathogens,"A termite population does not only pose a risk because of the significant structural damage they are capable of inflicting on buildings, crops, and forests, but their subterranean, eusocial lifestyle creates a breeding grounds for disease and microbial growth.  Despite decades of research, no commercially viable biocontrol agent targeted at termites has been developed.  Recent research has suggested termites possess superior defense mechanisms that provide them with virtual immunity against fungal and bacterial pathogens.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technology that can identify genes and proteins in termites that increase susceptibility to pathogens.  Whereas much research and development have gone into non-specific chemical insecticides that attempt to brute force their way through the termites' defenses, this new technology aims to dismantle the defense outright.  Using treatments of an immune-suppressive nicotinoid insecticide and fungi and bacterial pathogens, hundreds of genes that encode potential defense mechanisms have been identified; the expression of these genes can be suppressed, increasing the termites' susceptibility to pathogens.  Several protist symbiont enzymes were also identified which may have played a central role in protecting termites from fungal entomopathogens, and a recombinant form of these enzymes may have uses as novel drugs to fight fungal infections.Advantages:-More biorational and environmentally friendly than chemical insecticides-Protein-based enzymatic treatment offers a more ""organic"" approach than conventional drugsPotential Applications:-Termite control-Fungal infection treatmentRelated Publication:Molecular Signatures of Nicotinoid-Pathogen Synergy in the Termite Gut. PLoS ONE 10(4): e0123391. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0123391"
Peptoid Cancer Drugs Targeting PCNA Designed via a Novel in Silico/In Vitro Pipeline,"Fragment-based drug discovery is a popular method used to design molecules that bind to protein targets. In this method, many small compounds are screened for their binding to a target protein. Subsequently, steps are undertaken to combine more than one of the small compounds found to bind weakly into a larger, stronger-binding, drug-like compound. Fragment-based drug discovery presents a significant challenge; information must be known about the binding sites of the fragments so that they can be combined in a way that does not disrupt the binding of the individual fragments. In addition, many important drug target proteins participate in protein-protein interactions. Disrupting such interactions is critical to disrupting the chemical signals that drive cancer and other diseases.To overcome the challenges of traditional fragment-based drug design, researchers at Purdue University used a combination of computational and experimental technique to discover novel inhibitors of the interaction between proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and a peptide that binds to a site on PCNA responsible for multiple protein-protein interactions relevant to its cellular function. Specifically, thousands of tripeptoids (peptide-like molecules with three chemically distinct sites) were screened in silico, facilitating the selection of a small number of tripeptoids for in vitro testing. Several of the selected tripeptoids show a good ability to disrupt the PCNA-peptide interaction. This method of drug discovery successfully identified a small number of hit compounds that disrupt a protein-protein interaction involving PCNA, an important cancer target.Advantages: -Potential first-in-class cancer drug-Fewer compounds synthesized -Less structural information needed than in traditional fragment-based drug discovery-Well-suited to targeting protein-protein interactionsPotential Applications: -Drug discovery-Cancer therapy"
"High-Throughput, Quantitative Sensing of Protein Activity Using DNA-Encoded Probes","Molecular biologists and clinicians studying and diagnosing critical biological problems, including human disease and cancer, rely on methods to detect the activity of proteins that are often costly, not amenable to high-throughput detection, limited by their sensitivity, and ineffective for complex samples. A sensitive method to detect protein activity that overcomes these challenges has the potential to speed the pace and improve the quality of countless endeavors in biomedical research and diagnostics.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a platform that detects enzymatic activity in complex samples with high sensitivity that is cost-effective, high-throughput, and easily analyzed with current instrumentation. To accomplish this, a DNA sequence is used to encode a protein sample's activity in response to the presence of a drug or another change in conditions for each sample in a high-throughput assay. This technology has been successfully employed to detect activity of the metabolic protein, protein kinase A, and the proteins important to cancer biology, farnesyltransferase and caspase 3.Advantages: -Low cost-Highly sensitive-High-throughput profiling Potential applications: -Cancer diagnosis and characterization -Basic research -Drug development"
Aromatase Inhibitor Breast Cancer Therapeutics with Reduced Potential for Side Effects,"Aromatase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens, which is a crucial step in the biosynthesis of estrogens in the human body. Hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer cells are stimulated by estrogen; therefore, aromatase inhibitors (AI) have been widely used for treatment of this cancer in postmenopausal women. Despite the efficacy of AIs, these drugs have a variety of side effects including joint pain and susceptibility to bone fracture. More than 10 percent of patients discontinue AI therapy after six months due to musculoskeletal toxicity.To combat these side effects, researchers at Purdue University have developed a compound with dual activity as an aromatase inhibitor and selective estrogen receptor modulator. The compound's activity as a selective estrogen receptor modulator promises a way to avoid the undesired side effects. The compound's display binding to both aromatase and estrogen receptors and modulate estrogen receptor activity in vitro.Advantages: -Fewer potential side effects than current aromatase inhibitors-Modulates estrogen receptors  Potential Applications: -Breast cancer treatmentRelated Publications:Lv, Wei, et al. Synthesis of Triphenylethylene Bisphenols as Aromatase Inhibitors That Also Modulate EstrogenReceptors. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. 2016, 59, pp 157-170.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01677."
Questionnaire to Screen Adverse Patient Drug Reactions and Effects,"Many patients today are prescribed multiple medications to treat various health concerns. As the number of medications available grows, it becomes difficult for the doctor, pharmacist, and patient to know which medications are resulting in adverse drug reactions and effects. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a screening system, Pharmaceutical Therapy Related Quality of Life (PTRQoL) instrument. The PTRQoL system is a set of questionnaires that identify adverse drug reactions and effects associated with the 200 most popular prescription drugs. The PTRQoL system could be used by patients at a computer kiosk while they wait for their prescriptions to be filled. When the pharmacist is counseling the patient, they can utilize the results of the questionnaire to identify and focus on existing issues the patient may be experiencing. The PTRQoL system could also be used for mail-order patients to increase pharmacist/patient interaction.To view a video related to this technology, click this link:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJfv8S6ox0oAdvantages: -Patent is better served-Enhanced pharmacist/patient interaction-Pharmacies will be able to provide better, cost-effective counselingPotential Applications:-Pharmacies-Physicians-Patients"
P188 as a Treatment for Trauma to the Nervous System,"Following mechanical injury to the spinal cord, a large number of sensory and motor nerve fibers are disrupted and subsequently destroyed. The major pathology involved in such nerve loss is related to the breakdown of membranes of nerve cell axons, even to the point of complete severance. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and other copolymers seal nerve membrane defects and breaches caused by direct mechanical damage. Purdue University researchers have developed a technology that uses poloxamer P188 in spinal cord injury repair applications. P188 can be applied topically to exposed nerve fibers or by intravenous or subcutaneous injection. Similar research has been done with a related polymer, PEG; however, there are several advantages with using P188 in spinal cord injury applications. Advantages: -Can be produced in sterile form-Can be administered by intravenous or subcutaneous injection-Gives identical functional recovery to topically applied PEGPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Spinal cord injuries"
A Novel Method for Preparing Fusible Proteoliposomes for Biological Nanopore Sensing Technology,"The biological nanopore sensing technology is a technique that has been experimentally proven to sequence DNA and identify and quantify the targets of molecules with different sizes by means of a nanosized protein pore formed in a planar bilayer membrane at the single-molecule level. However, a huge challenge to this technique is how to realize efficient insertion of a variety of either the channel proteins from cell membrane or phage portal proteins into the bilayer membranes, which represents an extremely technical and tedious task. Especially for the proteins with high hydrophobicity, the proteoliposomes reconstituted with the proteins are always required. Unfortunately, the fusion of the proteoliposomes into the bilayers is often sporadic, unpredictable, and highly variable. Traditional methods, such as the use of high-cost biologically compatible detergents, can partially solve the issues, while they are not appropriate for mass production of the proteoliposomes. Moreover, improvements of the methods are also needed to extend the shelf life of the proteoliposomes for commercial purpose. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new method for the preparation of fusible proteoliposomes containing portal proteins from bacteriophages. To address the aforementioned issues with the proteoliposomes, this method eliminates the need for the high-cost detergents, making the proteins less hydrophobic and saving the time needed for detergent removal. The prepared proteoliposomes are more efficiently and rapidly inserted into the bilayers for nanopore sensing, maintaining an extended shelf life. This method has the potential for use as a practical and universal method for reconstituting the proteoliposomes with other hydrophobic channel proteins from cell membranes. It could be commercialized for different biomedical applications and enhance nanotechnology, biophysics, microbiology, and pharmaceutical research & development. Advantages:-Increased the protein stability in the proteoliposomes-Adjustable and highly efficient fusion of channel proteins into bilayer membranes -Better liposome longevity, easing storage and transport-Universal, simple, and practicalPotential Applications:-Biomedical applications such as nanopore sensing technology and liposome assisted drug-delivery systems-Enhance research areas that use proteoliposomes"
Microorganisms as Radiation Sensors,"Measuring radiation has been an ever-improving science since radiation became an important topic decades ago. While devices can measure radiation in quantitative fashion, measuring radiation dosages in organisms has been a harder case to solve. Current radiation sensing technologies cannot provide biologically relevant information regarding radiation exposure, which prohibits us from learning the level of radiation damage. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method of measuring radiation that correlates with the actual damage caused by radiation to DNA in organisms. By measuring the reaction outputs of microorganisms supplied by sugar, information can be gathered regarding the extent that radiation damaged the DNA of the cells. This method of measuring radiation in organisms can replace outdated film badges and similar sensors while providing better, more biologically relevant information.Advantages:-Simple design and easy to measure-Provides information useful for biological purposes-Correlates with DNA damagePotential Applications:-Radiation exposure treatment-Laboratory experiments"
Automatic Recording of Single Neurons Guided by Computer Vision,"One of the critical questions in neuroscience is how brain neural networks perform computations necessary for higher level cognitive functions.  To answer this question, one needs to record electrical activity of individual neurons with synaptic resolution.  The tool best suited to address this question is the whole-cell patch clamp technique, where multiple aspects of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents, cellular excitability, and interneuronal connectivity can be characterized.  However, this method is slow and requires users with high levels of expertise.Researchers at Purdue University have developed software that allows automatic patch-clamp recordings from individual neurons in a brain slice.  They have also developed a pressure control prototype that together with a micromanipulator, allow the program to control the patch-clamp process.  This technology uses computer vision to make this process completely automatic, requiring no human participation.  Automatic image guidance makes the whole-cell patch clamp technique faster, easier to perform, and accessible for less experienced users.Advantages:-Faster-Easier-Extensive training is not requiredPotential Applications:-Brain neural network research-Pharmaceutical testing"
Programs for Calculation of Electromagnetic Fields in MRI,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used as a noninvasive medical procedure to assist physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions. MRI scanners generate strong magnetic fields, which may pose risks or problems to patients with certain implants or medical devices, such as cochlear implants and many permanent pacemakers. Researchers at Purdue University have developed several programs for the analysis of the interactions between medical implants and the electromagnetic fields generated by MRI machines and others. Written in MATLAB, these programs are capable of calculating the heating of wires by an external magnetic field, calculation of electric currents induced by gradients in the MRIs magnetic field, calculation of magnetic fields induced in a patient by an MRI, and calculation of heating an entire medical implant during an MRI procedure. These programs are as of yet without a user interface; input and output are done with MATLAB. Advantages: -Increased patient safety -Calculates heating, electric currents, and magnetic field strength simultaneously Potential Applications: -Medical/Health-Monitoring interactions between MRI and medical implants"
Portable System for Imaging and Diffractometry,"Large microscopes are used for specimen analysis, restricting use to the laboratory setting. Diffraction measurements require custom built, experimental setups, which usually need a large amount of space and highly trained personnel to operate.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a completely portable package capable of performing bright-field imaging and diffraction-based measurements on samples.  This device includes all optics, electronics, on-board computer, touch-screen, and wireless interface.  Measurements and data analysis can easily occur outside of laboratories because the on-board computer is capable of performing a wide variety of analysis on captured images.Advantages:-Portable-Perform a wide variety of analysis and measurementsPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Medical testing-Research"
Impedance-Based Gas Detector Microchannels,"Fluidic microchannels are found in many biological systems and provide high rates of heat and mass transfer in organs such as the brain, lungs, liver and kidneys. Currently, these microchannels are frequently used for treating certain medical conditions; however, there is critical need to detect and avoid bubbles in the blood to prevent air embolisms during medical applications, a potentially fatal complication.Researchers at Purdue University have developed technology that can detect gas bubbles in microchannels coated with polyethylene oxide (PEO) and dielectric microchannels carrying a conductive fluid. Output signals from the low-cost and fast-responding electrical sensor can be used to monitor the fluid flow in the small-scale channel. This technology could have a significant impact on medical applications such as hemodialysis. Advantages: -Gas void fraction detection applicable at the microscale-Relatively inexpensive to implement -Prevent air embolismsPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Hemodialysis"
Waterproof Protein-Based Adhesives,"Around 230 million invasive surgical procedures are performed every year worldwide and almost all of these procedures introduce additional tissue damage when stitches and staples are used to seal the incision. Designing an effective surgical adhesive that does not cause extra damage and may be applied internally is an important goal in biotechnology research. To be effective, a soft tissue adhesive should be biocompatible, set in a wet environment, create a strong bond, and match the stiffness of the surrounding soft tissues. The surgical glues used most commonly, fibrin-based and cyanoacrylate, are not effective enough to replace stitches and staples. Fibrin-based sealants form weak bonds and cyanoacrylates cause inflammation.Researchers at Purdue University are developing an effective surgical adhesive that shows promise in other applications as well. The glue uses a family of recombinantly produced proteins and an enzymatically modified amino acid to form a strong elastic bond between the soft tissues being joined. The structural control afforded by this genetic engineering approach will allow molecular level alterations to the material's properties for promise in future uses. For example, the challenging process of integrating biologically inert prostheses with native tissue could be improved by adhering growth factor domains on prostheses to promote cell proliferation. This novel material may also be used to prevent migration of cells after chondrocyte implantation in cartilage repair.Advantages:-Matches soft tissue elasticity-Genetic approach allows many possible future usesPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Surgical adhesive to replace stitches and staples-Prostheses-Cartilage repair"
Dihydroquinazoline-Derived Inhibitors for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive mental deterioration, resulting in loss of memory, confusion and disorientation, and other behavioral problems. Unfortunately, no definitive cure has been developed to treat this disease. Beta-secretase, an important enzyme in the development and onset of Alzheimer's disease, contributes to the formation of amyloid-beta peptides that aggregate in the brain of Alzheimer's patients. Blocking beta-secretase is a potential strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Researchers at Purdue University have developed novel compounds that inhibit beta-secretase for Alzheimer's treatment. By focusing on a known dihydroquinazoline scaffold, a series of novel dihydroquinazoline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated. Several compounds in this series were shown to exhibit better beta-secretase cellular inhibitory activity compared to current compounds reported in literature. These compounds show increased potency, improved aqueous solubility, increased metabolic stability, and improved oral bioavailability.Advantages:-Improved beta-secretase cellular inhibition-Increased metabolic stabilityPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical industry"
Peptidomimetic Inhibitors for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive mental deterioration, resulting in loss of memory, confusion and disorientation, and other behavioral problems. Unfortunately, no definitive cure has been developed to treat this disease. Beta-secretase, an important enzyme in the development and onset of Alzheimer's disease, contributes to the formation of amyloid-beta peptides that aggregate in the brain of Alzheimer's patients. Blocking beta-secretase is a potential strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a series of novel compounds for beta-secretase inhibition that offer improved pharmacological properties. Novel peptidomimetic scaffolds were utilized to replace conventional hydroxyethylamine isosteres and were shown to be good inhibitors of beta-secretase. This series of compounds shows increased potency, improved aqueous solubility, increased metabolic stability, and improved oral bioavailability over previously identified inhibitors or beta-secretase.Advantages:-Improved pharmacological properties-Shown to be good inhibitors of beta-secretasePotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical Industry"
"Medication Use Simulation Software for Pharmacy, Nursing, and Medical Students
","At present, there are not many ethical methods to teach medication safety through practice based learning in the classroom environment. Purdue University added medication safety as a core course in 2014, when other universities had yet to fully implement the course. In healthcare facilities, professionals are not encouraged to experiment with safe practices as this can cost patient lives. In addition, no standardized level of training for safe practice is available.To bridge this gap in training, Purdue University professors have developed a tablet-based, mid-fidelity simulation that replicates the medication use process in a hospital environment. This simulator allows students to complete tasks according to their roles in the simulation. The tablets will simulate an electronic health record with real-time updates on medications prescribed and administered, as well as the clinical condition of the simulated patients. The focus of this technology is to track the impact of hospital processes on patient outcomes, especially with adherence of best practices in that setting. Compared to currently available options, the simulator would place the student in a physical environment similar to that of a professional site and includes peer interaction in a safe manner, with continuous tracking of outcomes. Since this is a mid-fidelity technology, it is less expensive to develop and maintain compared to high fidelity programs, but at the same time, it is more detailed and accurate to real world scenarios than low fidelity programs. This technology has potential for use in coursework and training for students in healthcare environments to replicate best medication use practices. It will be an adjunct to regular classroom lecture material.Advantages:-Hands on simulation of hospital environment-Practice for safe medication use-Mid-fidelity technologyPotential Applications:-University coursework and training-Replicate best medication use practices-Continuing education on medication safety for professionals"
SwayWatch: A Smartphone App to Quantify Balance,"According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of sports related traumatic brain injury (TBI) visits to hospital emergency rooms grew to 248,416 children (age 19 or younger) in 2009, an increase of 57 percent compared to 2001. In addition, TBIs were recently linked to costly and life altering medical problems such as Alzheimer's. Many sports leagues have taken an initiative to reduce TBI related risks by implementing new rules, but these guidelines are very subjective and difficult to determine. Therefore, there is a need for low-cost technology that can quickly and accurately determine the severity of head injuries. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an application for smartphones where the camera captures the motion of markers on the feet and/or ground while a person is standing. The motion of the markers is directly correlated to the person's trunk motion, which is used to quantify the body sway. The body sway can be used to quantify changes in balance resulting from a TBI in athletes. In addition, this technology can be used as a biomarker for diseases, such as Alzheimer's and autism. This technology is an effective and economical alternative given it relies solely on a smartphone. Advantages: -Superior accuracy -Simple and economical compared to current solutions -Better quantification of sway Potential Applications: -Capture the motion/sway of a person standing -Biomarker for diseases, such as Alzheimer's and autism -Monitor athletes following a TBI"
Bioresorbable Metals for Orthopedic Applications,"Currently, medical operations that require an orthopedic implant must be followed-up with a second surgery to remove the implant or the accompanying hardware of the implant. The additional surgery results in higher medical costs for patients and increases the risk of complications. However, the use of nontoxic, biodegradable implants could eliminate the need for a second surgery. According to BCC Research (2015), the global market for implantable biomaterials is expected to grow through 2019 at a compounded annual growth rate of 6.7 percent.Researchers at Purdue University have developed technology for a resorbable orthopedic implant that is safely absorbed after providing adequate support for damaged bones. This resorbable metal technology provides superior properties over its counterparts, including high porosity for vascular invasion, control of particulate size and degradation rate, and control of mechanical properties to support fixation. Furthermore, the inclusion of hydroxyapatite particulates helps promote bone cell mineralization.Advantages:-Eliminates the need for a second surgery to remove implant-Superior control over porosity, surface area and roughness, and corrosion rates-Promotes bone recovery with the inclusion of hydroxyapatite particulatesPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Orthopedic injuriesRelated Publications:Michael Heiden, Eric Nauman, Lia Stanciu.

Augmented Reality Tools for Telementoring and Telesurgery,"Problem Addressed:Optimal surgery and trauma treatment requires a multitude of surgical skills that are frequently unavailable in rural hospitals and field locations.  Currently, telementoring is used to provide this missing expertise to such locations; however, these systems require the trainee to focus on a telestrator, fail to illustrate upcoming surgical steps, and give the mentor an incomplete picture of the ongoing surgery. Therefore, there is an unmet need for technology to facilitate these complex telementoring processes. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel approach to surgical telementoring using an augmented reality (AR) simulated transparent display. The system allows a mentor to add annotations to be displayed for a mentee during surgery. The annotations are displayed on a tablet held between the mentee and the surgical site as a heads-up display. As it moves, the system uses computer vision algorithms to track and align the annotations with the surgical region. Among other applications, this system allows trainees to remain focused on the surgical region and reduces the potential for errors during surgery. Advantages: -Utilizes augmented reality to enhance the sense of copresence -Computer vision algorithms track and align the annotations with the surgical region -Allow trainees to remain focused on the surgical region Potential Applications: -Telementoring -Telesurgery -Distance learning"
Colony Imaging and Analysis,"Currently, for the identification of bacterial colonies, techniques have been developed using laser light scatter, which creates patterns or fingerprints that can be classified and used to identify the microorganisms. However, very small colonies are hard to identify and some colonies are not organized in a structured fashion, like bacteria; therefore, there is a need to have enhanced imaging other than just a laser scatter. To solve this issue, researchers at Purdue University have developed a technique that introduces an additional colony image by recording the entire colony image and associating it with a laser scatter pattern, which is later saved in a database where features can be extracted. This method of combining regular images of the entire macroscopic area of interest with the laser scatter fingerprint allows for the evaluation of very small colonies (less than 150 microns) or for cell systems other than microbial colonies. This technology is used in conjunction with current laser scatter techniques, adding only one second per colony to the current method. Different colored light sources can be used to collect reflected or back-scattered light from which additional information can be deduced regarding the colonies. Using the image camera, non-microbial populations, such as stem cells, fibroblast colonies, and other cell colonies, can be segmented and the image processed to identify appropriate or reduced to phenotypically useful groups. Advantages: -Additional images used -Enhanced imaging of colonies -Non-microbial species identifiedPotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Diagnostics-Drug development-Clinical trials-Food safety"
"Mechanism for Preventing Bone Density Loss from Sedentary Behavior
","When people lead a sedentary lifestyle by choice or due to age or illness for more than 5 to 10 weeks, they often experience significant bone loss and are at high risk for developing osteoporosis and fracturing a bone. When muscles are not used, the muscles atrophy and a loss of muscle strength occurs. Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, are a common occurrence for those that are bedridden or sedentary. As our population continues to age, more people will experience such effects. One challenge of extended space travel is the long-term effects of microgravity on the human body. Approximately 1.5 percent of bone tissue is lost per month of space travel, leading to an increased risk of bone fractures and osteoporosis when astronauts return to earth. Skeletal muscle is no longer required to maintain posture. Given the aforementioned, the unique subset of muscles used in microgravity leads to rapid overall muscle atrophy. In addition, elevated blood calcium levels from bone loss result in dangerous calcification of soft tissues and potential kidney stone formation. It is unknown whether bones ever truly recover completely. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a device that can provide daily mechanical stimulation to an appendage such as an arm, to prevent the loss of bone density and muscle atrophy in a bedridden environment or in space travel. This device is a comfortable, lightweight sleeve that can be worn every day for 30 minutes to promote bone and muscle health for those that are sedentary, bedridden, or traveling in space. The mechanical stimulation encourages natural blood flow throughout the arm, which is known to stimulate and maintain bone density and muscle tone. This device could be used to prevent bedsores in bedridden patients, fracture healing, osteoporosis prevention, and other ailments related to blood circulation. In addition, it could be used after extended space travel.Advantages: -Prevents loss of bone density and muscle atrophy in bedridden or microgravity situations -Prevents bedsores -Osteoporosis prevention -Increases blood circulationPotential Applications: -Aeronautics Engineering/Manufacturing -Medical/Healthcare"
Diaper-Embedded Transponder for Monitoring Urinary Tract Infection,"Urinary tract infections account for more than 8.1 million visits to physicians' offices per year. If not identified and treated early, urinary tract infections can be a major source of additional disease. To identify urinary tract infections, urine collection and lab urinalysis are two methods currently used; however, there is no existing method that uses a diaper-embedded sensor for patients and infants.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a diaper-embedded transponder for early detection/screening of urinary tract infections. Once activated by urine, the transponder measures and transmits the information via a wireless link to the caregiver. The transponder is autonomous, self-powered, and it provides accurate and timely information.  Advantages: -Diaper embedded-Autonomous and self-powered-Provides accurate and timely informationPotential Applications:-Nursing homes-Hospitals-Nurseries"
Hazardous Material Decontamination Platform,"Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane), has designed, patented, and deployed a Hazardous Materials Decontamination Platform to elevate a responder above possible chemical runoff during decontamination operations. The platform is a portable, re-usable, elevated platform providing a large, non-slip, grated surface on which an individual wearing a fully-encapsulated, hazardous materials suit may stand, and turn, to ensure thorough on-site decontamination. Advantages:- Increased stability and safety- Enhanced durability- Expedited decontamination process- Enhanded portability- Easy to store and deployPotential Applications:- First Responders- Fire Departments- Law Enforcement- Military- Haz-Mat Teams"
Electromagnetic Drug Delivery Using Nanowires,"Targeted drug delivery methods aim to confine the concentration of medication in some body parts relative to others. The goal of such treatments is to target only the diseased tissue maximizing the effectiveness of each dose and reducing negative side effects in other tissues. Cancer treatment is one of the most highly researched areas within targeted drug delivery due to the potential of therapies that target tumors, avoiding the nonspecific side effects of chemotherapy. Researchers at Purdue University have developed an electromagnetic drug delivery system constructed of polypyrrole (PPy) nanowire matting. This material is designed to act as a reservoir for drugs, and is responsive to an externally applied electromagnetic field (EMF) that induces the release of the captured drug into the local environment. Delivery can be turned on or off by using the noninvasive EMF source located remotely from the PPy drug reservoir. The therapeutic agent can be delivered from the inserted or surgically placed PPy mat for many weeks, and the specific region that is targeted can receive very high drug concentrations while systemic regions remain unaffected. Advantages: -Localized drug targeting -Dosage control -Reduction in negative, systemic side effects Potential Applications:-Medical/Health-Pharmaceutical Industry"
Gait Analysis to Predict Falls in Elderly Using a Smartphone Camera,"Falling is a major health issue among older adults (aged 65 and over). According to the CDC, one out of three older adults fall each year, and in 2010, 2.3 million nonfatal fall injuries among older adults were treated in emergency departments. Early identification and prediction of fall risk is likely to help minimize actual falls and the development of secondary problems such as reduced confidence and activity levels. Current methods include accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pressure sensors embedded in shoes; however, these methods are hard to use, not portable, and expensive.In response to the need for a more efficient and effective gait analysis and fall detection system, researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel gait analyzer and fall predictor that can measure stride length, stride time, velocity, and cadence using a camera feature in a smartphone-type device attached to a user. The gait analysis initiates when the user stands and the foot identifiers are recognized by the camera and software. The low cost and high accessibility of the gait analyzer and fall predictor device means that the fall risk can be assessed with an easy to use, unobtrusive solution when compared to existing expensive methods. To view a video related to this technology, click on this link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLXnTx6Rb6AAdvantages: -Multiple measurements - stride length, stride time, velocity, and cadence-Low cost, easy to use, and unobtrusivePotential Applications:-Medical/Health-Senior healthcare-Fall prediction/prevention"
Novel Diabetes Treatment,"Diabetes is a widely prevalent disease that currently affects 25.8 million people in the United States. The predominant form of diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from a combination of reduction in pancreatic beta cell activity and mass, which leads to insufficient insulin production. An enzyme called memapsin 1 is known to be part of the biochemical pathway that leads to the problems with pancreatic beta cells and ultimately causes insulin deficiency. Memapsin 1 deactivates a transmembrane protein shown to increase beta cell proliferation and improve glucose stimulated insulin secretion. The transmembrane protein is deactivated when it undergoes ectodomain cleavage in a process triggered by memapsin 1. Researchers at Purdue University in collaboration with Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation have developed and assayed a series of lead compounds that act as memapsin 1 inhibitors and increase pancreatic beta cell mass. Treatment with these compounds may also be complimented by other therapeutics that increase insulin production, improve glucose homeostasis, or inhibit hyperglucagonemia. Advantages: -Improved glucose homeostasis -Specific enzyme pathway regulationPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals"
SafePace:  Pacemaker Lead Placement System,"Pacemakers are biomedical devices implanted into patients with hearts that have difficulty pumping blood throughout the body. Electrical stimulation from leads in the pacemaker helps the cardiac tissue contract in an effective rhythm. The stability of the pacemaker leads must be assessed to guarantee successful pacemaker implantation, but current methods of testing can leave a wide range of inconclusive results.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new device that will allow surgeons to accurately determine if pacemaker leads have been implanted stably. The device will be fitted mechanically to the pacemaker lead and the surgeon will easily be able to determine if the device disengages from the lead or not. If the device disengages, the implantation has been successful. Otherwise, if the device does not disengage, the implantation is not stable and the pacemaker implantation must be repeated. This device provides a simple method for testing pacemaker lead stability with a clear result.To view a video related to this technology, click on this link:  http://youtu.be/YMSs4vFzf48Advantages:-Simple to use-Clear, accurate answer about pacemaker lead stabilityPotential Applications:-Medical/Health"
Synthesis of Novel Potent Nosocomial Antibiotics,"Hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections cause or contribute to 99,000 deaths each year in the United States alone. A patient's weakened state combined with bacteria's increasing resistance to antibiotics makes these infections difficult to treat. The current suite of antibiotics available for treating serious nosocomial infections, such as MRSA, can have unwanted side effects; hence, it is important to identify new antibiotics.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a class of antibiotic compounds designed to specifically target common nosocomial infections. By selectively targeting the mevalonate pathway of Gram-positive bacteria, these compounds will be more effective with fewer side effects. Several of the analogues also demonstrated selective antibacterial activity against MRSA and VRE, two of the most common and most dangerous nosocomial infections.Advantages:-Targets common nosocomial infections-Fewer side effectsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceutical Industry-Drug Development"
Recovery of Function In Chronic Spinal Cord Injury,"In the United States, there are between 240,000 to 337,000 people chronically injured with severe behavioral loss from spinal cord damage, with approximately 12,500 new cases each year. There is currently no treatment that can recover functions for those affected. Previously, researchers at Purdue University's Center for Paralysis Research have shown 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to be clinically effective in treating chronic spinal cord injury in both dog and man; the compound is now in phase II human clinical tests. Purdue University researchers have developed chemical analogues of 4-AP with superior pharmacological properties compared to the parent compound. Special analogues and cocrystals of the compound 4-AP were synthesized and their biological properties were tested. These compounds and all related derivatives and prodrugs dissolve readily at stomach pH facilitating the distribution of the parent compound and the analogues through the body subsequent to oral intake. These drugs (under stomach pH) have been shown to improve nerve impulse conduction through injured spinal cords in in vitro experimental models. Advantages: -More effective than 4-AP -Long-term stability -Slow dissolution -Facilitates ease of clinical administrationPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals"
Treatment for Demyelinating Diseases and Conditions,"Mechanical damage to the nervous system of mammals sometimes results in irreversible functional deficits. Most functional deficits associated with trauma to both the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) and Central Nervous System (CNS) result from damage to the nerve fiber or axon, blocking the flow of nerve impulse traffic along the nerve fiber. Spinal cord injury is a compression injury to the cord where the injured region of anatomically intact nerve fibers does not function. In particular, this local region (usually less than 1 vertebral segment in extent) does not conduct nerve impulses through the region of damage. 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) has shown promise in restoring nerve function in paralyzed persons; however, clinically meaningful recoveries of function only occur in about 30 percent of the treated population.  For the balance of those receiving treatment, recoveries are associated with numerous unwanted side effects, such as dizziness, loss of balance, and seizure. Researchers at Purdue University have developed analogues of 4-AP, which provide longer lasting effects at a lower concentration with fewer side effects than comparable treatments with 4-AP. The compounds, upon in vivo administration, reduced the effect of traumatic CNS tissue injury by the restoration of nerve impulse conduction through nerve tissue lesions. Advantages: -Analogue of known pharmaceutical -Restores nerve impulse and function in spinal cord injury -Longer lasting than current standard, with lower dose and fewer side effectsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals"
Morphologically Friendly Tissue Imaging,"Imaging mass spectrometry is currently in the translational phase as a tool in medical histopathology and offers a capability of mapping drugs, metabolites, lipids, peptides, and proteins without the need for labeling. Currently, a primary limitation preventing good correlational analysis is the use of chemicals that destroy native tissue structures.Researchers at Purdue University have developed a novel, morphologically friendly method for DESI-MS tissue imaging. The use of processing chemicals that preserve native tissue structures, instead of destroying them, expands the applications of DESI-MS to tissue imaging. DESI-MS has been used in real time to help surgeons decide how much tissue to take during cancer removal procedures. This new morphologically friendly procedure allows a facile means to distinguish between cancerous and healthy tissues. Advantages:-Native tissue structure preserved	 -Enhanced imaging of complex cancerous tissuesPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Medical imaging"
DNA Modified Nanocomposite Microbiosensors,"Electrochemical biosensors have offered new insights into cellular metabolism. The technology allows scientists to measure the metabolic activity (oxygen, glucose, lactate, etc.) of a single cell or a group of cells. Conventional biosensor materials suffer from low sensitivity and low spatial resolution, but single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) combined with black nanoparticles have been shown to significantly enhance performance. However, it was noted that the carbon nanotubes suffer from aqueous insolubility, limiting the ability to interact with the metabolite of interest.   Purdue University researchers have developed a technology that uses nanocomposites in electrochemical biosensors. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was used to modify SWCNTs to increase solubility in water, making it more useful in physiological applications. The ssDNA-SWCNT nanocomposite exhibits high sensitivity, wide linear range of detection, and low limit detection. This work is significant to biosensor development because this is the first demonstration of ssDNA-SWCNT nanocomposite as a platform for constructing both single-enzyme and multi-enzyme biosensors for physiological applications.Advantages:-Increased sensitivity and spatial resolution-Lowered limit of detectionPotential Applications:-Genetics-Biotechnology"
Detection of Oxidized Proteins for Medical Diagnostics,"Oxidative damage to DNA, RNA, and proteins can seriously threaten the survival of a biological system. High concentrations of radical oxygen species have been implicated in many diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and a variety of inflammatory diseases. Oxidative stress appears to be caused in part by an organism using iron to carry out oxidative processes. Free radicals, ranging from hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, and peroxynitrite to superoxide, occur widely in cells as part of the assimilation and metabolism of nutrients. Researchers at Purdue University have developed a diagnostic method for determining the absence or presence of a disease. This method includes assaying the amount and/or type of oxidized peptides in a sample from a subject and comparing them to the amount and types of reference oxidized peptides. For example, using this technique could identify and quantify changes in oxidized peptides or oxidized proteins associated with diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus or breast cancer. This diagnostic method can also be used to monitor a patient's response to a therapeutic agent, e.g., an antioxidant, and monitor disease recurrence. Using the vital information collected with this method, a tailored treatment plan can be created to better aid a patient's recovery. Advantages: -Proteomic approach to disease monitoring and diagnosis -Protein biomarkers detected at low concentrations -Earlier detection of a large number of diseases -Non-invasive testPotential Applications:-Bioinformatics-Medical/Healthcare"
Body Fluid Component Electrochemical Biosensor ,"There is a growing need for more sensitive instruments for biological sensing. With medical research proving that even minute changes in body fluid can show early warning signs of diseases, such as cancer, biosensors need to be sufficiently sensitive to detect these changes.Purdue University researchers have developed a functioning biosensor technology that incorporates nanotubes to successfully immobilize the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx). This permits the sensing of glucose in a blood sample with greatly improved sensitivity over existing technologies, and there are expectations that this technology could be applied to monitor glucose levels in other body fluids, such as saliva. The general nature of this technology means that it could be readily adapted to sense other important body fluid components. Advantages:-Monitors minute changes in glucose levels -Could be adapted to sense other body fluid componentsPotential Applications:-Medical/Health"
Potent Dimerization Inhibitors for HIV-1 Protease,"Advances in the treatment of HIV/AIDS with HIV-1 protease inhibitors in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), has resulted in improved life expectancy and significantly reduced HIV/AIDS-related mortality in the developed world.  Unfortunately, HAART suffers from adverse drug side effects, poor oral bioavailability, and drug interactions.  Also, drug-resistant HIV-1 variants have begun to emerge.  Development of antiretroviral therapy with broad-spectrum activity and minimal side effects is needed for current and future HIV/AIDS treatment.Purdue University researchers have created Darunavir, brand name Prezista, a drug used to treat HIV infection.

Cp-THF and Tp-THF-Based Novel Protease Inhibitors,"AIDS is an epidemic of global proportion; over 30 million people currently live with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Among many strategies to combat this disease, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with HIV protease inhibitors in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors continues to be the first-line treatment for control of HIV infection. This treatment regimen has definitely improved quality of life, enhanced HIV management, and halted the progression of the disease, and today, more people than ever before are living with HIV/AIDS. However, HIV is quick to develop resistance to new protease inhibitors. As a result, the pharmaceutical industry is continuously searching for new drugs to fight drug-resistant HIV. Darunavir is currently the industry gold standard and has shown the most efficacy in treating drug-resistant HIV strains. Researchers at Purdue University have designed a series of novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors for treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. These compounds have shown enzyme inhibitory activity and antiviral potency on par with Darunavir. Detailed virological studies suggest drug-resistance profiles with the potential to outperform Darunavir, positioning this promising class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors on deck in the fight against drug-resistant HIV.Advantages:-High enzyme inhibitory activity and antiviral potency-Exceptional drug-resistance profilePotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-HIV/AIDS Treatment"
Novel Ligands for HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors,"The AIDS epidemic is one of the most challenging problems in medicine in the 21st century. A retrovirus designated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a complex disease that includes progressive destruction of the immune system and degeneration of the central and peripheral nervous system.Among many strategies to combat this disease, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) continues to be the first-line treatment for control of HIV infection. This treatment regimen has definitely improved quality of life, enhanced HIV management, and halted the progression of the disease. Today, more people than ever before are living with HIV/AIDS thanks to this first-line treatment. However, despite the impressive success, there remain many challenges to treating this devastating disease, including decreasing both the toxicity and complexity of the treatment regimens. In addition, there is a growing population of patients that are developing multidrug-resistant strains of HIV, and there is ample evidence that these strains can be further transmitted. Purdue University researchers have designed and synthesized a novel class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors, which show potency 10x greater than that of Darunavir, an FDA-approved inhibitor developed by the same researchers. A number of these inhibitors are very potent against multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants and could lead to additional drugs used in HIV/AIDS treatment.Advantages: -HIV therapeutic with 10-fold potency increase over current standard-Effective for the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains of HIV Potential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug Development-HIV/AIDS Treatment"
Internalization of Anticancer Cargo by Bladder Tumor Cells,"Bladder cells are well protected and particularly difficult for topically applied therapeutic agents to penetrate.  Constant urine influx and periodic voiding of the bladder further limits the effectiveness of therapy.  Currently, instillation of live Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is most commonly used to increase penetration of therapeutic agents in the treatment of bladder cancer; however, administration of BCG is associated with high local morbidity and the potential for systemic infection.  There is a need for the development of safer, less toxic approaches to administer therapy.Researchers at Purdue University have developed an effective strategy to promote the internalization of anticancer cargo using the fibronectin attachment protein (FAP) from BCG to gain admittance to bladder tumor cells.  FAP binds strongly to targets on the surface of bladder tumor cells; it is subsequently internalized along with the chemotherapeutic cargo.  To combat the transitory nature of bladder contents, an antibody-induced microaggregation strategy is employed that promotes rapid internalization of FAP by bladder tumor cells.  Furthermore, FAP binding on the surface of bladder tumor cells is resistant to the acidic environment of the bladder.  These properties make it an excellent foundation for the design of more effective, less toxic bladder cancer therapies.Advantages:-High-affinity targeting of bladder tumor cells-Rapid internalization-Binding is resistant to the acidic environment of the bladderPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Pharmaceuticals-Drug development-Biotechnology"
Antimicrobial Activity of Substituted Thiazoles Against MRSA,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a global health concern due to its high mortality rate and ability to spread rapidly. For the year 2012, a study by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that 18.74 percent of patients in US healthcare facilities were infected or colonized with MRSA, contributing to an estimated 8,128 deaths from healthcare associated (HCA) infections. In addition, many treatments previously used against MRSA are no longer effective due to the development of microbial resistance to these antibiotics. Consequently, there is currently a dearth of effective treatments for MRSA. Given the severity of MRSA infections, attributed health care costs are estimated between $3 billion and $4 billion per year.Researchers at Purdue University found that a class of chemicals known as thiazoles could be substituted with specific molecular groups to be effective antimicrobials against MRSA and other microorganisms including listeria monocytogenes and bacillus anthracis. These chemicals were shown to inhibit the growth of MRSA cells in broth microdilution trials; furthermore, they were shown to be noncytotoxic to mammalian cells. These two factors mean that this class of substituted thiazoles holds great promise as a future treatment for MRSA infections.Advantages:-Effective at preventing MRSA cell growth-Does not harm mammalian cellsPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Medicinal Chemistry-MRSA Treatment"
Improved Speech Recognition for High-Frequency Hearing Loss,"With conventional hearing aid processing, individuals who have severe to profound mid- to high-frequency hearing loss still have great difficulty perceiving important speech information.  Alternative processing strategies that move inaudible high-frequency information to lower frequency regions where hearing loss is less severe have been proposed; however, they all have a common flaw in that they tend to increase confusion between certain sounds, especially 's' and 'z'.  The seriousness of this problem is illustrated by the fact that these sounds constitute about 8 percent of all spoken consonants in the English language.  Purdue University researchers have developed a unique digital signal processing technique that recodes high-frequency speech information in a way that enhances perceptual differences between commonly confused speech sounds.  In preliminary testing, the algorithm has worked better than commercially available alternatives, especially for the consonants 's', 'sh', 'ch', 'j', 't', 'k', and 'z'.  No degradation in vowel recognition has been observed.  The efficacy of using this technology for a broader range of hearing losses, including those with cochlear implants, is currently being tested.Advantages:-Improved identification of consonants-Vowel degradation has not occurred-Preliminary testing shows improvement over current commercial alternativesPotential Applications:-Medical/Healthcare-Heath Loss Technology"

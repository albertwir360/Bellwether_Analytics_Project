    Despite decades of research, there are currently no effective therapies for tauopathies, a class of neurodegenerative disorders that include Alzheimer’s disease. While recent studies have indicated that tau oligomers are the primary
    toxic species in these diseases, very few clinical compounds that target tau itself are being pursued. To fill this gap, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed biosensors that monitor tau oligomer and monomer
    conformations that can be used as a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform to identify novel compounds that modulate tau and attenuate associated toxicity. These compounds could be used in research to accelerate our understanding of
    tauopathies and how to treat them and/or could be developed as therapeutics.
</p>

<p>
    The technology works through two engineered distinct fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors. The first of these biosensors measures intermolecular interactions between separate tau proteins, allowing a readout of
    oligomerization. The second biosensor uses single-molecule FRET (smFRET), to assess conformational changes within single tau proteins. Combined, the readout from these molecular probes will facilitate identification of compounds that
    inhibit tau oligomerization, and provide immediate insights into mechanism of action. Another major advantage of these biosensors is that they are functional in live cells, allowing screening to be carried out in a biologically relevant
    context and without the need for costly and time consuming purification protocols.

    \nPhoton upconversion is a process in which low energy photons are converted into higher energy photons. Potential applications include solar energy harvesting as well as other applications such as photodynamic therapy, thermal
    management, and deep-tissue imaging. Most state-of-the-art photon conversion materials (such as lanthanides and non-linear crystals) require high intensity, coherent light and the alternatives (such as triplet-triplet-annihilation) have
    limited bandwidth of operation and are typically unable to make use of near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. In addition, materials that undergo upconversion under low intensity continuous wave excitation are extremely rare.\xa0
</p>
,
<p>
    \xa0\n\n<br />
    Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a plasmonic nanomaterial that shows strong upconversion with low-threshold continuous wave laser illumination. This material can convert low energy photons (in the near infrared
    region) to high energy photons (in the visible region) under non-pulsed illumination. This material ranks among the lowest threshold upconversion materials currently available and is non-toxic, highly stable in solution, and could
    easily be processed to make upconverting glasses or films.\n
</p>
,
<p>
    In current photovoltaics, about two-thirds of the incident spectrum is lost; low energy photons do not have enough energy to move electrons to the conduction band. Employing the process of upconversion, wherein two or more low energy
    photons are converted to one higher energy photon, can reduce these spectrum losses and increase the efficiency of solar panels. This material could be applied as coatings on top of conventional solar cells, thus increasing their
    efficiency at very low cost. In addition, as this material is non-toxic and small enough to be easily endocytosed, it could be used for phototherapeutic or deep tissue imaging applications using excitation in the near-infrared window.

    Cancerous cells exhibit alterations to their metabolism that may contribute to proliferation, survival and the development of drug resistance to commonly prescribed cancer treatments. Unfortunately the mechanisms of these metabolic
    changes aren’t well understood, limiting progress on cancer drug therapies. Laurie Parker’s lab at the University of Minnesota developed four artificial, cell-permeable kinase substrates that serve as biosensors for serine/threonine
    kinases (LKB1, AMPK, mTOR and Akt) that are intimately involved in metabolism regulation. The ability to determine the activity of these critical kinases in normal, cancerous and drug-resistant cancer cells will help determine the
    metabolic activities of cells, how resistance develops, and provide molecular targets for therapeutic development.

    The kinase-specific biosensors have the potential to be combined with assayable fluorophores or other signal moieties, or the phosphorylation of the peptidesalone can be measured using alternate methods such as mass spectrometry.
    Substrates can further be selected based on their ability to permeate the membrane and their compatibility with live cells, The capability of the sensors to provide real-time signaling facilitates the potential to simultaneously monitor
    distinct kinase activities in native cellular environments. The sensors are antibody independent, can be optimized for high-throughput screening methods and (unlike other approaches to monitoring kinase activity) do not need to be

    Kinase signaling is a major mechanism driving many cancers, particularly leukemias. However, due to variation between cancers, chemotherapeutic kinase inhibitors (such as imatinib/Gleevec) exhibit different levels of efficacy on a
    patient-by-patient basis. With no feasible way to determine which treatment is best suited to each patient, nearly $100 million dollars and precious treatment time are lost every year to ineffective therapies. To determine the best
    kinase inhibitor treatment strategy on an individual basis, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a multiplexed mass spectrometry assay that is capable of analyzing and comparing the specific activity of multiple
    kinases exposed to different therapeutics. Furthermore, the analysis for all these conditions can be run in tandem, saving time and money.
</p>
,
<p>
    The power of the assay to simultaneously measure a variety of kinases exposed to multiple compounds is enabled by isotope-coding of kinase-specific substrates. Cancer cells, various inhibitors and kinase specific peptide substrates are
    coincubated. The substrates are isotopically distinct for each condition, allowing kinase inhibitor activity to be measured and directly compared after carrying out mass spectrometry on pooled samples.This provides a robust, fast and
    affordable method to determine if a patient will respond to a variety of different kinase inhibitor therapeutics. Furthermore, since clinics already routinely use mass spectrometry for metabolite analysis, this approach can immediately
    be implemented using existing workflows and machinery. This technology has the capability to transform kinase inhibitor treatments and serve as a model system for introducing pharmacodynamics into personalized medicine for leukemias and
    other cancers.

    Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) kinase is one of the most frequently mutated genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Early studies have shown that mutations in FLT3 are correlated with poor long-term prognosis with increased risk for
    relapse. To assess FLT3 activity, Laurie Parker’s lab at the University of Minnesota designed substrates phosphorylated by FLT3 in a manner that is highly efficient and specific. Coupled with fluorescent and/or mass spectrometric
    readouts, these peptides are valuable tools in both drug discovery and diagnostics for FLT3-linked AML.
</p>

<p>
    The developed FLT3 artificial substrates (FAS-A) is compatible with living cells and facilitates rapid detection of kinase activity in real time. When compared to alternatives, FAS-A is phosphorylated 200% more effectively than the only
    other FLT3 substrate reported in the literature (FLT3tide). Due to its high selectivity, FAS-A can be used in complex lysates or mixtures and with negligible off-target effects and can be multiplexed with other assays. Finally, the
    phosphorylation of the substrate can be measured using ELISA, mass spectrometry, or through incorporation of terbium binding segments, facilitating a fluorescent readout. This flexibility facilitates the use of the substrate in a wide
    variety of applications including high-throughput and drug discovery methods.

    Due to their universal presence in cells, the ability to measure and compare the activity of kinases is critical for basic research and to develop drugs and diagnostics for a myriad of diseases. However, the variability in activity
    between different kinases or between batches of the same kinases has hampered the development of robust control/normalization techniques. Dr. Laurie Parker’s lab used their previously developed KINATEST-ID platform to design and
    optimize a non-selective “universal” substrate for tyrosine kinases that can serve as a normalizer for any kinase of interest. This fully characterized standardizing compound allows for more accurate comparisons of activities from
    reaction to reaction for other substrates or inhibitors.
</p>
,
<p>
    Currently the only identified universal tyrosine kinase substrate is the polyGlueTyr polymer, which is a relatively poor substrate with slow rates of phosphorylation. The newly developed substrate is efficiently phosphorylated by all
    tyrosine kinases tested and compatible with high-throughput screening methods. The substrate can be used as a “standardizer” for intrinsic activity, for quality control, and for normalization of kinase enzyme preparations in comparative
    experiments. Since the method does not require kinase modification or tagging of kinases, it can further serve as a real time baseline of total tyrosine kinase activity in living cells. When combined with biosensors for specific
    tyrosine kinases of interest, the approach facilitates monitoring specific kinase activities in their novel cellular environment over time. This technique can be applied to diagnostics and drug discovery methods that require monitoring

    \nResearchers in Prof. Jiarong Hong’s laboratory have developed <b>an image reconstruction algorithm using a machine learning approach for accurate reconstruction of three-dimensional particle fields from digital holography.</b> Image
    reconstruction algorithms are used to extract useful particle information (such as size and 3D position of bubbles, aerosols, cells, etc.) encoded as complex interference patterns in digital holograms. However, currently available
    algorithms perform suboptimally at realistic conditions such as when high particle concentrations, high dynamic, background or cross-interference noises are present. Moreover, practically relevant particle field reconstruction often
    requires sophisticated data acquisition, tedious fine tuning and is computationally intensive. \n\n<br />
    <br />
    \nUsing specialized U-net architecture, the algorithm disclosed here has been shown to accurately reconstruct images and extract particle information with high prediction accuracy and extraction rate at significantly wider range of
    concentrations than previously demonstrated. Particularly, instability issues and reduced localization accuracy caused due to sparsity in the particle field is tackled in this novel algorithm. The algorithm is developed using a
    combination of synthetic and experimental data, and is optimized for quickly producing high localization accuracy, smooth background and reducing ghost particles. The design of this system reduces the need to fully learn the required
    physics, therefore reduces the training and tuning requirements for new hologram datasets and is easily adaptable in a wide range of applications. In other words, this learning-based algorithm is highly generalizable. Lastly, this
    learning-based hologram reconstruction is &gt;30 times faster than currently available methods, making it suitable for developing systems with real-time reconstruction capabilities. \n

    While wearables, such as FitBit and other activity trackers, are useful for tracking and recording user’s physical and sleep activities, annotation and effective interpretation of data requires expertise. Moreover, evaluation of
    longitudinal activity data is done only in retrospect. Recently, researchers at the University of Minnesota developed a data mining and machine learning approach to optimize a prediction framework, that anticipates sleep quality
    beforehand. By evaluating a person’s physical activities over time, the algorithm recommends a set of activities to improve the quality of the individual\'s sleep.
</p>
,
<p>
    Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for clinical sleep diagnosis, and requires multiple sensors to track brain activity, body movement, heart rate, breathing frequency, and O2 levels. While PSG provides high-fidelity data,
    accuracy can be low because patients are required to sleep in the hospital, missing the more accurate picture of a patient’s behavior in familiar settings. Wearables on the other hand, can track sleep and physical activities
    (actigraphy) around-the-clock in familiar settings. This recommender system was developed to evaluate actigraphy data of individuals using human activity recognition algorithms. After evaluation, the algorithm can identify behavioral
    patterns that lead to good or poor quality sleep. These patterns are then used as target behavior, to ensure a good night\'s sleep. This machine learning algorithm can be integrated with existing wearables to predict and recommend

    This technology is a software based model for analyzing whole brain diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to estimate function specific brain circuits. The approach reveals
    detailed anatomical connectivity patterns for each functional module and recovers structural connections that are underestimated by diffusion MRI (dMRI). Using Human Connectome Project (HCP) data, the model successfully identified
    function specific anatomical circuits, such as the language and resting state networks.
</p>
,
<p>
    Traditionally, estimating brain circuits by incorporating information from functional MRI into diffusion MRI is challenging. Seed regions for tractography are selected from fMRI activation maps to extract the white matter pathways of
    interest. This new method jointly analyzes whole brain dMRI and fMRI data revealing detailed anatomical connectivity patterns for each functional module. This novel framework explicitly models interactions between structural and
    functional connectivity measures, thereby improving anatomical circuit estimation.

    This technology is a new MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) acquisition sequence implemented in software that provides clinical quality images under extremely inhomogeneous magnetic fields. The novel method employs radiofrequency (RF)
    pulse trains for signal excitation and acquires refocusing echoes generated by the RF pulse train excitations. It does not use refocusing RF pulses.\xa0
</p>
,
<p>
    This new steady state sequence uses a train of low-flip-angle (e.g., 5°) short duration (e.g., tens to hundreds of microseconds) pulses and a wide bandwidth for signal excitation. It is specifically designed to yield robust data in the
    face of extreme B0 inhomogeneity while limiting RF peak power and specific absorption rate (SAR).\xa0
</p>
,
<p>
    A modified version of this MP-SSFP sequence can also be used to map the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of B0, even when the degree of B0 inhomogeneity is extremely large. For example, high quality three-dimensional (3D) images and
    B0 mapping have been demonstrated using a magnet with 200 kHz of resonance frequency variation across the object of interest. In a clinical 1.5 Tesla magnet, this degree of B0 inhomogeneity corresponds to ~3000 ppm.
</p>
,
<p>
    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) under highly inhomogeneous static magnetic fields faces fundamental difficulties in signal excitation and data acquisition. The conventional approach of using spin-echo sequences is limited by the
    requirement to use short, high-flip-angle (180°) refocusing pulses which results in high SAR in subjects. This new approach introduces an MRI method under inhomogeneous magnetic fields that uses only short, low-flip-angle RF pulses. A
    3D B0 map can be measured by using phase-encoding in all three spatial directions.

    This technology is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) pulse sequence for cardiac imaging which enables an increased number of slices across the heart volume per heart beat resulting in enhanced temporal and spatial resolution. The
    method may result in a decrease in overall scan time.\n\nThe novel method combines outer volume suppression (OVS) and accelerated imaging, such as simultaneous multi-slice (SMS)/compressed sensing (CS), without introducing fold-over
    artifacts.
</p>
,
<p>
    Cardiac MRI is often slow and is typically limited to only three slices across the heart per heartbeat. In addition, 3D high resolution cardiac imaging sequences can take up to 10 minutes. Current OVS techniques do not usually allow for
    a reduction of the FOV, as the residual signal creates fold-over artifacts. This novel method enables increased acceleration rates and reduces fold-over artifacts. Combining OVS with SMS and CS accelerates scan time, particularly for
    body imaging and improves temporal and spatial resolution.
</p>
,
<p>
    A novel imaging sequence uses the CAIPIRINHA method for multi-band (MB) imaging to allow myocardial perfusion imaging. This method adds an outer-volume suppression module to reduce signals from the chest and back while the heart is
    imaged. Multi-band imaging may increase the coverage significantly, and adding the OVS module may enable faster multi-band imaging rates.

    This technology is a new magnetic resonance spectroscopy-magnetization saturation transfer (MRS-MST) pulse sequence implemented in software that provides the ability to measure adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis rate in vivo. It is
    a double-saturation 31P MST protocol that uses inversion-recovery data and spectral data to measure ATP hydrolysis rate without requiring quantification of inorganic phosphate levels. By eliminating the need to quantify inorganic
    phosphate (Pi, 31P), this technology overcomes the primary barrier in determining the ATP turnover rate in vivo. The method will help basic science researchers investigate the energetic foundation of the function and dysfunction of
    certain organs and tissues. Clinically, it may be used to grade tissue function, to grade the severity of certain heart diseases (e.g. myocardial infarction) and evaluate stem cell treatments and other therapies with high spatial
    resolution.
</p>
,
<p>
    It has been speculated that decreased myocardial ATP production may contribute to cardiac dysfunction. However, accurate measurements of myocardial ATP turnover rates could never be examined in vivo. Magnetic resonance
    spectroscopy-magnetization saturation transfer (MRS-MST) has been extensively used for more than a decade to measure the ATP flux via creatine kinase (CK) in myocardial tissue. However, MRS-MST has generally not been successful in vivo
    in large animal models because the products of ATP hydrolysis (ADP and Pi) are at levels too low to be accurately measured. This new MRS-MST method can calculate the ATP hydrolysis rate in vivo in humans. It allows ATP hydrolysis rate
    to be measured in organ systems where inorganic phosphate levels are difficult to quantify.

    This technology is algorithms implemented in software on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. The method is expected to increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which enhances image fidelity, reduces tissue heating (SAR), and enables
    image acceleration. It comprises the beam forming invention: Receive-only, Transmit (B1 shimming) and Receive, and Synthetic Aperture. The latter is expected to improve SNR even though computational complexity and scan time may
    increase.The method is expected to be compatible with most 3T clinical scanners.
</p>

    To improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), current magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners borrow phased arrays techniques from radar. However, when this approach digitizes image data it does not use certain information (e.g., geometric
    information pertaining to the directivity of each individual MR coil element) and may lose other information (e.g., phase), which could further improve SNR. This new software adapts the advanced radar techniques of beam forming and

    This invention uses ultrasound to measure the nonlinear mechanical properties of an object including those of biological tissues. This information can be used to detect abnormalities in tissues. The technique combines the advantages of
    using acoustic radiation force (ARF) ultrasound for local tissue characterization and the capability of assessing the nonlinear tissue elasticity as an additional new modality for differential cancer diagnosis.
</p>
,
<p>
    At present, no techniques are capable of assessing nonlinear tissue elasticity locally via acoustic radiation force (ARF) ultrasound. ARF generated by modulated ultrasound is already used in a number of medical diagnostic techniques:
    Vibroacoustography, Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI), Supersonic Imaging, and Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging (ARFI). However, these techniques only diagnose the tissue locally by assessing its linear elastic parameters.
    Estimating a tissue’s nonlinear elastic parameters may elevate the differential diagnosis of cancerous lesions. This localization is especially important when imaging highly heterogeneous tissues as it allows the user to distinguish, in
    terms of linear and nonlinear tissue, between neighboring regions with high spatial resolution.

    A new pre-scan method can measure radio-frequency (RF) induced currents flowing on metallic leads during an MRI excitation. The method first acquires low-power images around a metallic lead (including those used for Deep Brain
    Stimulation, or DBS) using conventional Gradient Echo Sequence (GRE) accelerated by parallel acquisition (i.e., GRAPPA). Then it analyzes the images and quantifies the magnitude and phase of the RF induced current. To do so, it uses the
    relative location of the B1+ null with respect to the lead position in axial images. Finally, it models/matches the null location at the vicinity of the lead. The calculated induced current is patient and lead location specific. The
    measurement can be used to predict safe excitation scenarios, reduce heating around the lead and may also significantly improve image quality.

    A new technology localizes the origins of cardiac arrhythmia via clinically available 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) enhanced by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a realistic computer heart model. After registering the cardiac
    model with individual patient’s heart, training datasets are generated and the origin(s) of focal cardiac arrhythmias are localized. ECG data is fed into one or more CNNs (one CNN classifies atrial applications; two CNNs classify
    ventricular sources). The applicable CNN identifies the segment of the heart where the arrhythmia originated and whether it has an epicardial or endocardial focus. This novel technology can not only map premature ventricular contraction
    (PVC) in patients, but may apply to other cardiac disorders (e.g., ventricular tachycardia and atrial arrhythmias). It may provide real-time monitoring and localization of cardiac arrhythmias origins which can be used to guide ablation
    treatment.
</p>

    A novel referenceless technique corrects magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images by removing Nyquist ghost artifacts from echo planar imaging (EPI). The algorithm seeks to find a set of optimal phase correction parameters that minimize

    A novel metabolomics method can detect pre-invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells by measuring aerobic glycolysis (conversion of glucose to lactate). The ability of cancer cells to produce lactate through aerobic glycolysis is a
    hallmark of cancer, and increased glucose uptake and elevated aerobic glycolysis are closely correlated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.\n \nPre-invasive or metastatic cancer cells have dramatically increased
    production of 3-13C-lactate produced from 1-13C-glucose, over non-invasive cancer cells. By measuring the rate of aerobic glycolysis, which closely correlates with glucose uptake and lactate production in cancer cells, this technology

    Adaptive 3D printing is a new approach that allows 3D printing on moving freeform surfaces. The closed-loop method combines direct ink writing of functional materials and real-time feedback control to fabricate devices on moving

    A new algorithm tracks exterior and interior surfaces of organs to provide a surgeon with a real-time, 3D view of organs as they deform. The 3-D reconstruction allows the surgeon to “see” through the wall of an organ during surgery
    rather than just look at its surface. The algorithm is based on sparse sampling of the exterior surfaces tracked by identifying subspaces in which the coefficients of spherical harmonic representations of the surfaces live. It uses
    pre-operative CT/MRI scans during training and needlescopic images acquired during tracking. Viewing live tissue deformation allows the surgeon to track the 3-D reconstructed image and guide surgical intervention. This technology will

    Existing technology cannot track 3D organs during surgery using needlescopic incisions. Procedures that minimize the size and number of incisions should reduce hospitalization time, lower complication rates, and ultimately reduce the

    eliminating the major drawback of single port interventions. It provides the first-ever real-time interior organ surface reconstruction using sparse sampling of exterior surfaces with error rate as low as 0.095%. When the algorithm was

    uniquely feature PBP2x localization at both the septal ring and the center of the septa during division. Adding clickable groups or affinity groups such as biotin can isolate the PBPs and proteins associated with them in the cell. The
    probes enable imaging and visualization of specific PBPs expressed and catalytically active in bacteria by conjugation to fluorophores and through click chemistry handles. The compounds have potential for studying specific PBPs, their
    physiological role in bacteria, and their mechanisms of resistance. Advancing knowledge of the physiological role of specific PBPs may allow development of new and selective PBP inhibitors. Additionally, these probes could serve as
    safer molecular diagnostic tools that aid in identifying resistant bacterial strains and contribute to personalized therapies.

    Fluorescently labeled antibiotic probes bind to PBPs along an antibiotic backbone consisting of a β lactam antibiotic. The binding process allows for specific PBP labelling so researchers can visualize activity and isolate PBPs for
    further use (i.e., studying bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, gel-based analysis of penicillin-binding proteins and bacterial imaging applications). Studying PBP activity in cell wall synthesis also lends important insight to bacterial
    resistance mechanisms.
</p>
,
<p>
    PBPs, targets for many antibacterial agents, are involved in the synthesis and crosslinking of the peptidoglycan polymeric structures that comprise bacterial cell walls. Standard methods for detecting PBPs use probes that are
    radioactive and difficult to handle for large scale analysis. Furthermore, current methods are insufficient in the study and characterization of individual PBPs expressed in bacteria, and analysis is time consuming. This new technology
    generates selective activity-based probes to evaluate PBP localization and activity in Streptococcus pneumoniae, where the alternative β-lactones scaffold can generate PBP-selective imaging agents for assessing PBP2x. These
    fluorescently labeled chemical structures can be used for gel-based analysis of penicillin-binding proteins and bacterial imaging applications. The primary advantage of these probes is their demonstrated ability to selectively probe for
    individual or groups of PBPs, not currently possible with commercial PBP inhibitor-fluorophore conjugates.

    An adaptive image-based refocusing algorithm uses synthetic-aperture imaging data for safe and effective focused ultrasound in imaging and treating tissue abnormalities in complex media. The refocusing technology, designed for
    ultrasound arrays with transmit-receive capabilities, is well-suited for any imaging array with transmit-receive capability (in particular, for large-aperture arrays capable of operating in therapeutic and imaging modes, like dual-mode
    ultrasound arrays (DMUAs)). The array is capable of imaging in both synthetic aperture (SA) and single-transmit focus (STF) modes, and imaging provides real-time feedback for quality refocusing. The algorithm can be implemented on any
    existing imaging system with software or hardware access to pre-beamformed raw element data and contains hardware features for efficient real-time adaptive refocusing as new system architecture.
</p>

    Ultrasound imaging arrays are increasingly being used in pulse-echo imaging of complex media (e.g., transcranial imaging of the brain, breast, large-aperture trans-thoracic cardiac imaging), and non-invasive high-intensity focused
    ultrasound may even be used for deep-brain stimulation (instead of electrical stimulation via embedded electrodes). However, bone causes beam distortions and defocusing, a major hindrance of using focused ultrasound successfully in
    these applications. This new adaptive refocusing method offers imaging interspersed within energy bursts/shots and combines synthetic aperture (SA) and single-transmit focus (STF) echo data and performs the optimization in multiple
    bands in order to maximize the focusing gain.

    A site-specific patch, which attaches to the skin like an adhesive bandage, offers non-invasive transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) neuromodulation via dual-mode ultrasound array (DMUA) transducers. The DMUA transducer patch features
    lightweight transducers with a low-profile, layered structure of a 3D-printed lens (based on the treatment target and surface topography), thin polymer piezoelectric transmitting-receiving elements and a thin backing material (i.e.,
    alumina or flexible circuit boards). A low power driving circuit is driven by a battery-powered handheld device. The patient-specific design and the 3D printed lens allow this device to target specific volume within the brain or other

    Ultrasound imaging using a dynamic nonlinear post-beamforming filter (e.g., based on a pth-order Volterra model) is capable of separating the linear and nonlinear components of image data (e.g., extracting the nonlinear components of
    the image data). The technique is applicable (but not limited) to both tissue and contrast agent nonlinearity. A system identification algorithm derives the filter coefficients. The filter based approach is capable of extracting a broad
    band of frequencies that allow for contrast enhancement while preserving image detail. True nonlinear interaction between these frequency components is accounted for by using a pth-order Volterra filter. The method for ultrasound
    imaging of matter in a region provides wave energy into the region, where the wave energy has a pulse spectrum centered at a fundamental frequency. Wave energy returned from the region is transduced to form a set of receive signals,
    which are beam-formed to provide data representative of at least a portion of the region. The linear and nonlinear components of the beam-formed data are separated based on a pth-order Volterra model (where p is equal to or greater than
    2). The non-linear components of the beam-formed data can be processed to form an image.

    A two-stage variational approach for segmenting 3D bone computed tomography (CT) data performs robustly with respect to thin cartilage interfaces. The method uses fracture mechanics in the second stage to remove fine-scale contact
    bridges that connect object contours generated in the first stage. This approach eliminates spurious contacts between individual segmentation regions based on the transfer of the phase-field fracture approach to segmentation and the
    seamless integration of fracture mechanics principles with existing (variational) segmentation methods. The process segments objects (e.g., bone objects) from surrounding tissues in a medical image (e.g., those obtained with CT or other

    Multi-band echo planar imaging (MB-EPI), a new approach to increase data acquisition efficiency and/or temporal resolution, can potentially overcome critical limitations of standard acquisition strategies for obtaining high-resolution,
    whole brain perfusion imaging using arterial spin labeling. While multiband may also introduce certain confounding effects, recent studies reveal that the amplified noise (given by the geometry factor, or g-factor) and the leakage
    contamination (assessed by the total leakage factor) have minimal impact on cerebral blood flow estimation. The studies demonstrated that compared to SB-EPI, MB-EPI improves high-resolution, whole brain pCASL perfusion imaging in terms
    of improved spatial and temporal signal-to-noise ratio efficiency. Furthermore, it increases compliance with commonly used single blood compartment models, resulting in improved cerebral blood flow estimates.

    A computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tool, based on a novel predictive model for cancer detection from quantitative multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) data, uses magnetic resonance images to identify key markers of prostate cancer to aid in
    diagnosing and monitoring prostate cancer. The method, validated on histological prostate cancer tissue, requires the implementation of a multi-parametric MRI study consisting of multiple echo time fast spin echo acquisitions, dynamic
    contrast enhanced MRI, diffusion weighted imaging at multiple diffusion weightings (b-values), and gradient echo acquisitions at different flip angles. The software automatically processes datasets into a composite biomarker that

,
<p>
    The current gold standard for prostate cancer screening, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, results in many false positives and false negatives, and is unable to localize possible tumors or give information on the seriousness of
    the illness. Current standard for evaluating mpMRI data by way of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System are largely subjective using qualitative measures for disease identification and monitoring, and other current diagnostic tests
    (i.e., digital rectal exams (DRE), and trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy), do not provide the information needed to confidently diagnose and manage prostate cancer in an optimized, cost effective way. These limitations result
    in high numbers of unnecessary, untargeted, painful biopsies (e.g., “random” cores from partitioned sections), and grading based on cores that may not strongly indicate aggressiveness of tumors. This new mpMRI technology overcomes these
    limitations by way of a unique database of in vivo MRI and correlative pathology, and predictive models (composite biomarkers) for disease detection, grading (and eventually for assessing aggressiveness) on a voxel-by-voxel basis.
    Essentially, it offers improved models for imaging radiogenomics (i.e., the correlation between cancer imaging features and gene expression) that will improve or change the prostate cancer patient workflow. For example, the process
    could introduce MR imaging prior to biopsy for detection/grading and/or guidance for biopsy, reduce overtreatment, and improve targeting of therapy (e.g., brachytherapy, external-beam radiotherapy, etc.). Advantages over current
    approaches include improved performance in terms of overtreatment and under-staging, potential for improved detection, grading, and therapy guidance (which may improve patient outcome and reduce healthcare costs), and voxel-by-voxel
    quantitative assessment without user intervention.

    A dual mode ultrasound array system provides real-time 2D/3D displacement and strain imaging in the vicinity of a vessel to identify and localize the vessel walls. The system uses a real-time monitoring and feedback image control of the
    therapy based on imaging data acquired using the dual mode ultrasound array (DMUA) of transducer elements, and adaptive, real-time refocusing improves imaging and therapy by using array directivity vectors obtained from DMUA pulse echo
    data. The technique provides simultaneous imaging of the vector flow field and the wall/tissue motion and the corresponding strains at high spatial and temporal sampling, which may provide an essential tool in modeling fluid-solid
    interactions between the blood and blood vessel. The DMUA imaging capability is sufficient for target identification and treatment, and the high resolution imaging removes the “shooting in the dark” element from image-guided HIFU
    procedures when targeting vascular structures.
</p>
,
<p>
    Most relevant ultrasound work on vascular imaging relies on grayscale data and uses normal frame rates. By using 2D/3D speckle tracking with specialized imaging modes for identification of the vessel boundaries, this new approach
    improves the localization of the vessel wall and constructs its boundaries, making it easier to identify plaques and other abnormalities. The method images displacement and strain fields in the vicinity of flow channels and shows that,
    at sufficiently high frame rates, speckle tracking methods produce well-behaved displacement estimates of both the tissue motion and flow in the channel.

    No existing focused ultrasound devices employ vessel wall and flow imaging in the planning and execution of thermal and nonthermal treatment of target vessels. Current treatment probes lack the special characteristics this technology

    Multi-band SWIFT (MB-SWIFT) is a magnetic resonance pulse sequence that produces better diagnostic images by significantly increasing excitation and acquisition bandwidths, which reduces blurring, increases signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
    for fast relaxing spins, and allows imaging even without comprehensive shimming of the static magnetic field B0. This method is the first in the class of ultra-short (or zero) TE sequences to use a multiband excitation for imaging. The
    MB-SWIFT technology can image all types of human tissues including cortical bone or dental tissues that are problematic in current scanners, and will be advantageous in musculoskeletal and maxillofacial imaging, particularly near
    implants. It is also expected to be useful for lung imaging as well as in iron nanoparticle-based imaging and MR-PET combination scanners where accurate determination of bone location is critical. It also has the potential to look at
    other nuclei, such as phosphorus, to directly measure bone mineral density and could replace dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. In addition, using high bandwidths allows shortened time for acquisition of 3D images, which is beneficial
    for fast diagnostics or functional imaging types of study.
</p>
,
<p>
    Some of existing ultra-short (or zero) TE sequences can reach a high RF efficiency, but are limited by effective excitation bandwidth. Others can use high excitation bandwidth, but only at the cost of RF efficiency, which results in
    limited flip angles and less than optimal SNR. MB-SWIFT technology offers the flexibility to add a required number of pulse elements to excite extremely high bandwidth at still optimal flip angles. This advancement can be especially
    useful for MRI scans that necessitate the use of big and inefficient body or other RF coils.
</p>
,
<p>
    SWIFT (SWeep Imaging with Fourier Transformation) MRI is a “quiet” imaging technique that can image a wide variety of tissue types, including bone. However, limited bandwidth, inherent in all imaging, decreases transmit power efficiency
    and sensitivity in ultrashort TE imaging. And it reduces the amount of information about fast and slow relaxing spins in a single scan. As a result, SWIFT suffers from decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), increased specific absorption
    rate (SAR) and increased off-resonance blurriness. Similarly, current “silent” imaging sequences suffer from low SNR and blurring. This MB-SWIFT technology is a next generation of gapped SWIFT pulse sequence in which multiband
    (sideband) excitation dramatically increases bandwidth with reduced RF power, resulting in reduced SAR and increased SNR. In addition, it is easier to implement this version of SWIFT on current scanners, since pixels are based on the
    number of sidebands rather than number of gaps. Its improved diagnostic capabilities, due to increased image fidelity, allow expansion of MR into areas of the body that are less conducive to MR imaging, and for anatomical regions
    currently visualized well by conventional MRI methods, MB-SWIFT can add silence and increased speed.

    An intraoral radiofrequency (RF) loop coil placed, between the teeth, efficiently images teeth and associated dental structures. The coil is oriented with its axis parallel (coaxial) with the Zeeman field (coil plane perpendicular to
    B0) and captures B1 information using the coil’s transverse sensitivity volume. This orientation provides one of the most appropriate fields of view (FOV) for orofacial applications (i.e., it “sees” the necessary structures but does not
    “see” adjacent—and therefore non-relevant—anatomy). This orientation appears the most ideal for obtaining MR images for dental applications, as the sensitivity volume includes the most important dental structures (e.g. teeth, jaw) while
    mostly excluding cheeks, lips and spinal cord.
</p>
,
<p>
    Traditional dental image techniques (e.g. bite-wings, cone beam CT (CBCT), and Panorex) use ionizing radiation and have been linked to brain tumors and cataracts. Moreover, these imaging modalities cannot simultaneously image hard (e.g.
    dentin, bone) and soft tissues (nerves, inflammation, fat), have limited sensitivity to detect small anomalies in teeth (e.g. early caries/cavities, cracks/root fractures), and cannot be using in continuous fashion to obtain functional
    imaging (e.g. TMJ movement, blood flow in teeth). Using an extraoral coil for dental MRI is hindered by high signal from the cheek and the larger field of view reduces the resolution that is obtainable. Using an intraoral coil for
    dental MRI that is place beside the teeth is uncomfortable for the patient, does not image the apices/tips of the teeth, and only obtains images of 3-4 teeth at a time. This new intraoral MRI coil design solves these problems with a
    coil configuration that maximizes patient comfort, provides full coverage of the complete dental region, and largely excludes signal from unwanted tissues. This new approach uses a highly advantageous configuration that limits the field
    of view limited to a small region above and below the coil and allows the total scanning time to be reduced while maintaining high resolution.

    conditions of the RF coil caused by the subject during the imaging process. Automatically tuning the RF coil circuits provides real-time tuning that electrically maintains impedance matching conditions under various human anatomies. The
    method first measures a reflected signal of the RF coil, determines an adjusted (tuned or detuned) condition, and then adjusts matching capacitor array banks. The technology employs a fast tuning and matching procedure and offers robust
    performance (regardless of differing anatomy types) and a simple structure that can be integrated a small board or semiconductor chip.

    When a human subject is placed in an MRI scanner, a body “loading” effect degrades image fidelity by shifting the Larmor frequency and reducing the quality factor (Q). In current high-field (3T) clinical scanners, this effect can be
    largely ignored, but as emerging parallel transmit techniques become more prevalent at 3T and the industry moves to higher field strength systems (&gt;3T) it must be addressed. In current pre-clinical multi-channel parallel transmit
    systems and UHF MRI systems (&gt;3T) the manual tuning step to adjust for loading adds several minutes to the imaging procedure and requires skilled technician intervention, both of which are expected to hinder clinical adoption of
    &gt;3T MRI scanners and multichannel parallel transmit systems. With this new method, in only seconds each RF coil element in the auto-tuned circuit can be electrically tuned without technician intervention. A control circuit adaptively
    determines the optimal tuning conditions and electrically tunes the system. This new approach offers improved image fidelity, which enables more accurate diagnosis and clinical diagnostics not previously possible, and will likely be
    required for market acceptance of clinical 7T scanners and emerging “full” multi-channel parallel transmit systems.

    A new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach uses a spatiotemporally-encoded MRI pulse sequence (e.g., SWIRLY and/or STEREO) in combination with a smart, adaptive, or phased RF transmit front end. Combining these two components
    allows highly spatially localized regions of uniform excitation, even in the presence of B<sub>0 </sub>and B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> inhomogeneities. The transmit front end is comprised of a multichannel transmit array and multiple RF
    power amplifiers; each amplifier has dynamic phase and gain control over the output waveform. In addition, by exciting only a small region at any given time and allowing more freedom to optimize selected parameters, the technology is
    expected to reduce specific absorption rate (SAR).
</p>

<p>
    Beam forming techniques (e.g., B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> shimming or Transmit SENSE), while previously shown in MRI, use a “static” B<sub>1 </sub>shim or are based on k-space (Fourier) formalisms. In certain applications, these
    techniques are not optimal because they cannot avoid exciting signal outside the region of interest. Spatiotemporal imaging methods like STEREO (also known as SWIRLY) can achieve spatially-selective excitation while simultaneously
    compensating for B<sub>1 </sub>and B<sub>0 </sub>inhomogeneities. When combined with an RF front end that dynamically shims the RF B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> field and\ndynamically changes the B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> shim throughout
    the pulse sequence, these spatiotemporally-encoded MRI methods can further avoid destructive interference patterns typically seen in imaging sequences at ultrahigh field strengths. And as field strength continues to increase, current B
    <sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> shimming techniques for homogeneous transmit pattern will fail in the body (possibly even the head) because of the reduced wavelengths in the body, whereas this method will actually benefit from this better
    defined basis set.

    A new technology allows first-ever in vivo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR). The process employs a feedback system with real-time load compensation that enables in vivo simultaneous
    transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) images. The RF front-end and coil subsystem maintains high isolation over variable loading conditions. Phase and gain adjustments facilitating per-experiment load centering of this isolation demonstrated safe
    and successful human head imaging in vivo in a 4T MRI system. The load-insensitive design uses a feedback system to compensate load shifts during MR experiments. Fast decaying spin-to-spin imaging means there is no delay between Tx and
    Rx, so it can measure any signal regardless of decay time. Ultra-low\nRF peak power uses a continuous wave (CW) mode, which transmits and receives RF signals at the same time. Significantly, only 50 mW peak power over a 10-minute image
    acquisition was used. The use of ultra-low RF peak power offers great potential for the future development of a compact, low-cost, and safe MRI scanner.

    MR imaging based on simultaneous excitation and reception has great potential but has suffered from significant sensitivity to load (e.g. motion, respiration, swallowing, etc.). Until now, live in vivo simultaneous Tx/Rx (transmit and
    receive) experiments were not possible. Current MRI scanners transmit an RF pulse, wait a short period (dead time) and then receive a very small, decaying signal. This new technology features a feedback circuit implemented in hardware
    that cancels leakage signals, thus providing isolation between transmit and receive and allowing both to occur simultaneously. In addition, this new approach offers significant reductions in peak power and power deposition (specific
    absorption rate, or SAR) as well as an increased ability to image fast decaying signals for greater diagnostic capabilities.

    An accelerated MRI reconstruction approach, Robust Artificial-neural-networks for k-space Interpolation (RAKI) improves the noise properties of GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partial Parallel Acquisition (GRAPPA), which translates to image
    acceleration\n(i.e., faster scan times). This method learns a deep non-linear convolutional neural network (CNN) from limited scan-specific auto-calibration signal (ACS) data, and extends the linear convolutional kernels of GRAPPA while
    performing both training and reconstruction on a per image basis, leading to marked performance improvement. The method also extends to k-space interpolation techniques other than GRAPPA, and it is directly applicable to 3D parallel
    imaging, simultaneous multi-slice imaging, random\nundersampling and non-Cartesian sampling.

    Long scan times remain a limiting factor in MRI, often necessitating trade-offs with spatial and temporal resolution or\ncoverage. Accelerated imaging techniques are commonly required, with parallel imaging, e.g. SENSE or GRAPPA, being
    the most clinically used approach. However, image acceleration in parallel imaging is limited by the noise properties when estimating missing k-space points in GRAPPA (linear). While machine learning has previously been used in MRI, it
    required large databases\nof MR images for rigorous training, and relied on patterns across the training set rather than within each individual image. Until now, no other methods use deep learning in k-space in a self-contained manner.
    Applying machine learning techniques to train neural networks for interpolating missing points in k-space achieves higher acceleration rates and better noise properties. Once the CNN is trained, the reconstruction takes on the order of
    milliseconds.

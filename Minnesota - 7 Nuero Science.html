    Despite decades of research, there are currently no effective therapies for tauopathies, a class of neurodegenerative disorders that include Alzheimer’s disease. While recent studies have indicated that tau oligomers are the primary
    toxic species in these diseases, very few clinical compounds that target tau itself are being pursued. To fill this gap, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed biosensors that monitor tau oligomer and monomer
    conformations that can be used as a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform to identify novel compounds that modulate tau and attenuate associated toxicity. These compounds could be used in research to accelerate our understanding of
    tauopathies and how to treat them and/or could be developed as therapeutics.
</p>
,
<p>
    The technology works through two engineered distinct fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors. The first of these biosensors measures intermolecular interactions between separate tau proteins, allowing a readout of
    oligomerization. The second biosensor uses single-molecule FRET (smFRET), to assess conformational changes within single tau proteins. Combined, the readout from these molecular probes will facilitate identification of compounds that
    inhibit tau oligomerization, and provide immediate insights into mechanism of action. Another major advantage of these biosensors is that they are functional in live cells, allowing screening to be carried out in a biologically relevant
    context and without the need for costly and time consuming purification protocols.

    G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a prominent pharmacological target for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases and disorders. Exemplifying the success of this approach, more than 30% of FDA approved drugs target at least one
    GPCR and worldwide more than 25% of drug sales come from GPCR modulating compounds. To expand this promising this pharmacological space, Dr. Joseph Topczewski developed structurally novel small molecules that act as GPCR modulators with
    either agonist or antagonistic effects. Furthermore, some of these compounds target Sigma 1, a recently identified target for COVID-19 therapies.
</p>

    The new molecules are small, rigid derivatives of phenethylamine, a structural motif that is part of several natural GPCR ligands including dopamine and epinephrine, as well as morphine and pseudoephedrine. The GPCR binding affinity of
    these compounds was assessed through the Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (National Institute of Mental Health). In vitro testing has revealed one of the compounds to have negligible cytotoxicity and to be capable of inhibiting

    Traditional opiate-based pain therapeutics are linked to opioid use disorders, thus necessitating the development of novel, non-additive alternatives. One potential target for such new compounds is the human Histidine Triad Nucleotide
    Binding Protein 1 (hHint1). hHint1 is involved in the regulation of a broad range of CNS functions including opioid signaling, tolerance, neuropathic pain, and nicotine dependence. These roles, along with its widespread expression in
    the brain, have led hHint1 to be of high interest for research and therapeutic targeting. Given hHINT1’s role in modulating tolerance to opioids, it is a viable non-opioid receptor target for the next generation of pain medications.
    Researchers at the University of Minnesota rationally designed and synthesized hHint inhibitors that bind the protein with submicromolar affinities. These unique small-molecules could be used to further determine the role of Hint1 in
    the CNS or developed into therapeutics for indications for which there are limited options.
</p>
,
<p>
    Previous work using the hHint inhibitor Tryptamine Guanosine carbamate (TrpGc) has shown that hHint1 inhibition is a successful strategy to enhance the pain relieving effects of morphine while preventing tolerance. However, TrpGc
    exhibits low solubility which limits the applications it can be used in. The newly developed inhibitors are nucleoside analogs containing acyl-sulfamate or acyl-sulfimide that show increased solubility as well as binding to hHint1, up
    to 16 times higher affinity than TrpGc. These favorable properties facilitate the use of these compounds in a variety of applications and formulations as well as in the treatment of indications ranging from neuropathic pain and drug
    dependence.

    \nResearchers in Prof. Jiarong Hong’s laboratory have developed <b>an image reconstruction algorithm using a machine learning approach for accurate reconstruction of three-dimensional particle fields from digital holography.</b> Image
    reconstruction algorithms are used to extract useful particle information (such as size and 3D position of bubbles, aerosols, cells, etc.) encoded as complex interference patterns in digital holograms. However, currently available
    algorithms perform suboptimally at realistic conditions such as when high particle concentrations, high dynamic, background or cross-interference noises are present. Moreover, practically relevant particle field reconstruction often
    requires sophisticated data acquisition, tedious fine tuning and is computationally intensive. \n\n<br />
    <br />
    \nUsing specialized U-net architecture, the algorithm disclosed here has been shown to accurately reconstruct images and extract particle information with high prediction accuracy and extraction rate at significantly wider range of
    concentrations than previously demonstrated. Particularly, instability issues and reduced localization accuracy caused due to sparsity in the particle field is tackled in this novel algorithm. The algorithm is developed using a
    combination of synthetic and experimental data, and is optimized for quickly producing high localization accuracy, smooth background and reducing ghost particles. The design of this system reduces the need to fully learn the required
    physics, therefore reduces the training and tuning requirements for new hologram datasets and is easily adaptable in a wide range of applications. In other words, this learning-based algorithm is highly generalizable. Lastly, this
    learning-based hologram reconstruction is &gt;30 times faster than currently available methods, making it suitable for developing systems with real-time reconstruction capabilities. \n

    Spinal cord injuries can result in serious, debilitating outcomes including quadriplegia or paraplegia. There is a dire need to identify treatment strategies for this type of nervous tissue damage. Regenerative therapy has focused on
    the use of stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries and all related clinical trials have reported favorable safety profiles. Unfortunately, these same trials have failed to show improvement in patient nerve function. Drs. Leslie Morse
    and Ricardo Battaglino identified dental pulp stem cells as a promising therapeutic and have developed a method to prepare these cells and subsequently used them in rat models of spinal cord injury. These dental stem cells could be
    developed into treatments for patients with nervous tissue injuries.
</p>

<p>
    The researchers found in a rodent model of spinal cord injury, transplantation of dental pulp stem cells into the damaged tissue enhanced recovery through inhibiting apoptosis, preserving neural fibers and differentiating into mature

    Opioids like morphine have been used extensively for the treatment of chronic pain, including pain that is the result of diseases like cancer, AIDS and sickle cell disease. The analgesic effect from activation of the mu opioid receptor
    (MOR) is unfortunately accompanied by undesirable side-effects including tolerance and dependence. Furthermore, the administration of morphine and other opioids has been shown to actually enhance HIV infection in patients. To overcome
    these limitations, researchers at the University of Minnesota developed a two-part molecule, MCC22, that activates MOR to deliver analgesic effects while antagonizing CCR5 to suppress opioid-induced side effects.
</p>
,
<p><br /></p>
,
<p></p>
,
<p></p>
,
<p>
    Although mu opioids reduce pain, chronic use promotes increased pain sensitivity through the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines, including CCL5. This chemokine binds CCR5 (which colocalizes with MOR in glia and neurons) and the
    CCL5/CCR5 complex plays a major role in neuroinflammation. CCR5 is also the main co-receptors utilized by HIV-1 viruses to enter cells and accelerate AIDS progression. Through activating MOR and blocking CCR5, MCC22 is a potent
    analgesic that mitigates the pain sensitivity and neuroinflammation commonly associated with opioids. Furthermore, MC22 inhibits immune cell migration into the central nervous system, which is a critical step in HIV-mediated
    neuropathogenesis that leads to NeuroAIDS. MCC22 shows promise as a treatment of both inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions where conventional analgesics have reduced efficacy.

    \nProf. Lim at the University of Minnesota has developed a new method to suppress and potentially cure tinnitus using synchronized multi-modal stimulation of the brain. The technology consists of algorithms and devices that
    non-invasively or transcutaneously stimulate auditory and non-auditory pathways in a highly synchronized fashion. The technique stems from the hypothesis that tinnitus patients who experience abnormal brain representations continue to
    retain the normal (original) brain representations; and, by “shocking” specific regions of the brain, the brain can be switched back to the normal representation. Using highly synchronized multi-modal stimulation of specific regions in
    the brain, this technology acts as a “neural switch” that can switch neural activity to suppress tinnitus and phantom limb pain.
</p>
,
<p>
    Tinnitus, the perception of sound with no external source, affects 15-20% of the population and currently has no cure. Existing therapies include medications, using masking noises, or simply retraining the brain using individually
    programmed tonal music. While these methods eases tinnitus to a certain degree, they do not address the underlying cause. The technology disclosed here, on the other hand, induces a strong synchronous shock to specific regions of the
    brain to reset it from an abnormal state back to the normal state. Owing to such novel method of action, this non-invasive treatment technology has the potential to successfully switch the firing pattern of tinnitus-affected neurons to
    suppress and cure tinnitus and phantom limb pain. \n

    This technology is a noninvasive hearing multiplexing device that uses ultrasound signals to transmit audible sounds by exploiting cochlear regions that are under-utilized. The device, which is attached to the head/neck region, sends
    modulated ultrasonic signals to vibrate brain fluids. This vibration, in turn, produces audible sound signals in channels that are typically not used. As the signals are sent as vibrations through brain fluid, the airborne sound coming
    through the ear canal remains undisturbed. In other words, the device can be used to perform multiplexing with the cochlea to send desired sound signals in new perceptual channels without affecting normal hearing.
</p>
,
<p>
    Humans can hear sound signals in frequency ranging from 20Hz to 20kHz. However, some frequencies in this range are attenuated by the outer/middle ear (e.g., below 100Hz and above 8kHz). The technology described here uses modulated
    ultrasonic signals to enable hearing in those under-used frequencies. Multiple transmitters can be used to simultaneously stimulate different regions of the cochlea without distorting airborne sound. Such a technology can be utilized to
    send speech or other useful sound signals in a noisy environment, such as construction sites, war zone, or manufacturing facilities. This technology can be integrated with cell phones and other consumer products. This technology may
    also be used to develop new types of music production that combines normal sound along with ultrasound hearing. The device and accompanying algorithm can be optimized based on individual’s hearing preference and anatomy.

    \nNon-invasive techniques to reversibly modulate neural activity can be valuable in research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications. Researchers at the University of Minnesota recently discovered that transcranial low-intensity
    focused ultrasound (tFUS) can reversibly suppress evoked-responses and modulate functions within the nervous system. This technology uses a high-precision dual-mode, phased-array ultrasound system to deliver tFUS neuromodulation signals
    to target nervous tissues with high spatial resolution (voxel size: &lt; 2 cubic mm). Using specific parameters, tFUS can reversibly modulate neural activity by non-invasively heating a spatially-restricted volume of neural tissue
    without histological damage. This technology has also been shown to have superior temporal and spatial resolution when compared to other neuromodulation platforms, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct
    current stimulation (tcDCS). \n<br />
    \nProfessor Emad Ebbini’s team has demonstrated suppression of somatosensory-evoked potentials using tFUS in rodents. Activity suppression is found to be highly correlated and temporally consistent with <i>in vivo</i> temperature
    changes. Noninvasive heating of spatially-restricted volume of neural tissue without damage may provide a method of temporarily suppressing specific neural pathways or controlling networks through multiple foci. This technology may also
    be useful in investigating the basis of disease and neural function. Focused thermal neuromodulation pairs a method of noninvasive investigation of the underlying locations and networks of diseases of the central nervous system with a

    This technology is a system for coordinated reset deep brain stimulation (CR DBS) which uses a segmented DBS array electrodes and short-term electrical pulses delivered in a fixed or varying sequence. This therapy uses multiple contacts
    in different locations of the target brain structure to offer flexibility to CR contact configuration and intensity selection. In some cases, this can also provide flexibility to cross structure CR configuration. In addition, a novel
    stimulation strategy delivers high stimulation intensity at the beginning of treatment, until optimal therapeutic improvement is achieved, and then reduces the stimulation to a low intensity to maintain the therapeutic effect.
    Directional CR DBS could be used to treat nervous system or multiple movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson\'s disease, essential tremor, dystonia, and other neurological and/or psychiatric conditions).
</p>
,
<p>
    Traditional isochronal DBS, while a successful treatment for Parkinson\'s disease, has not changed for decades. Constant high frequency stimulation from the traditional DBS drains the device battery within several years, requiring risky
    battery replacement surgeries. In addition, current spread related side effects limit its application and therapeutic window. Directional CR DBS combines new DBS lead technology and a novel strategy to produce a comparable—or even
    better—therapeutic effect than traditional DBS therapies and with fewer side effects. Because it uses a very low stimulation intensity (one third or less than traditional isochronal DBS), it significantly reduces battery consumption.

    New membrane-permeable synthetic peptides could slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. These new peptides inhibit tau phosphorylation by targeting specific and multiple phosphorylation sites. This halts
    disease progression by inhibiting tau mislocalization to dendritic spines and subsequent tau-mediated neural deficits. The technology is anticipated to treat Alzheimer’s disease and other tau-associated neurodegenerative conditions
    (e.g., frontotemporal dementia, traumatic brain injury, chronic traumatic encephalopathy).

<p>
    Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has two main pathological hallmarks: beta-amyloid (Aβ) forming plaques and neurofibrillary tangles containing phosphorylated tau protein. No therapeutics currently exist that can slow or stop AD progression.
    Hyperphosphorylation of tau is associated with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Preventing hyperphosphorylation has become a key strategy. Previous attempts to treat AD by blocking tau phosphorylation failed because inhibiting
    the kinases (including CDK5 and GSK3) also shuts down other necessary cellular processes, leading to high toxicity. These two new peptides (termed WT and AP) prevent tau hyperphosphorylation. They act as targets for kinases so they do
    not hyperphosphorylate the tau protein. The WT peptide acts as a competitive inhibitor for the two kinases; the peptide becomes phosphorylated and native tau is not hyperphosphorylated. The AP modified peptide is unable to be
    phosphorylated but instead binds with the kinases, essentially “distracting” the kinases from native tau by so they phosphorylate native tau to a lesser extent. Because the peptides do not affect the global kinase activities of CDK5 and
    GSK3, they are likely to be highly effective without high toxicity.

    A site-specific patch, which attaches to the skin like an adhesive bandage, offers non-invasive transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) neuromodulation via dual-mode ultrasound array (DMUA) transducers. The DMUA transducer patch features
    lightweight transducers with a low-profile, layered structure of a 3D-printed lens (based on the treatment target and surface topography), thin polymer piezoelectric transmitting-receiving elements and a thin backing material (i.e.,
    alumina or flexible circuit boards). A low power driving circuit is driven by a battery-powered handheld device. The patient-specific design and the 3D printed lens allow this device to target specific volume within the brain or other
    neural targets like DBS, but without having to drill a hole in the patient’s skull.

    Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) neuromodulation shows promise as a noninvasive modality with a high degree of spatiotemporal control, but such spatial control often requires hundreds or even thousands of transducer elements,
    significantly limiting tFUS use to hospital settings. This patch design offers the highest level of spatial precision possible while requiring very low channel count, eliminating the need for a bulky driver for hundreds of array

    An accelerated MRI reconstruction approach, Robust Artificial-neural-networks for k-space Interpolation (RAKI) improves the noise properties of GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partial Parallel Acquisition (GRAPPA), which translates to image
    acceleration\n(i.e., faster scan times). This method learns a deep non-linear convolutional neural network (CNN) from limited scan-specific auto-calibration signal (ACS) data, and extends the linear convolutional kernels of GRAPPA while
    performing both training and reconstruction on a per image basis, leading to marked performance improvement. The method also extends to k-space interpolation techniques other than GRAPPA, and it is directly applicable to 3D parallel
    imaging, simultaneous multi-slice imaging, random\nundersampling and non-Cartesian sampling.
</p>

<p>
    Long scan times remain a limiting factor in MRI, often necessitating trade-offs with spatial and temporal resolution or\ncoverage. Accelerated imaging techniques are commonly required, with parallel imaging, e.g. SENSE or GRAPPA, being
    the most clinically used approach. However, image acceleration in parallel imaging is limited by the noise properties when estimating missing k-space points in GRAPPA (linear). While machine learning has previously been used in MRI, it
    required large databases\nof MR images for rigorous training, and relied on patterns across the training set rather than within each individual image. Until now, no other methods use deep learning in k-space in a self-contained manner.
    Applying machine learning techniques to train neural networks for interpolating missing points in k-space achieves higher acceleration rates and better noise properties. Once the CNN is trained, the reconstruction takes on the order of
    milliseconds.

    The Sliding Windowed Infinite Fourier Transform (SWIFT) algorithm analyzes and extracts frequency amplitude/phase information from digital signals in real time. This spectral analysis technique analyzes any real-time digital signal,
    from neural signals to accelerometer data to radio waves. The algorithm uses an infinite length causal exponential function as its window, which gives more weight to more recent samples, allowing SWIFT to be more sensitive to transient
    changes. This technology is guaranteed stable and has lower computational cost and memory requirements and improved frequency resolution and sampling as compared to other real time techniques. In addition, a modified version (αSWIFT)
    further reduces spectral leakage.
</p>

<p>
    The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is the standard tool for spectral analysis in digital signal processing, typically computed using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). However, for real-time applications that require recalculating the
    DFT at each sample or only over a subset of the N center frequencies of the DFT, the FFT is far from optimal. Sliding DFT (SDFT) computes individual DFT bins recursively but is only marginally stable and requires storing N previous
    inputs. Furthermore, its rectangular window causes spectral leakage. The SWIFT technology overcomes these limitations and is faster, requires less\nmemory, produces cleaner data, can select any frequency and is more stable than
    currently used algorithms.

    A new multi-modal, targeted approach to deep-brain stimulation (DBS) therapy manages multiple symptoms simultaneously to treat various neurological and co-morbid conditions. In particular, the technology can help Parkinson’s disease
    (PD) patients overcome co-morbid sleep disturbances by using DBS waveforms and stimulation parameters to promote sleep. The technology uses the same electrodes to deliver different stimulation at night to the same targets stimulated
    during the day. Sensing and stimulation algorithms detect and monitor stages and quality of sleep via electrophysiological recordings in the same deep brain targets used to stimulate and treat PD motor symptoms. Delivering waveforms and
    patterns/frequencies to these same targets at the appropriate times can modulate/induce the next stage of sleep. The method can be expanded to other severe sleep disturbances as well as other eventual DBS indications with sleep
    co-morbidity.

    DBS therapy treats PD motor symptoms when patients are awake, but no method currently exists to treat the common sleep disturbances that can be more disabling and resistant to treatment than the motor symptoms. Pharmacological
    treatments can cause undesired side effects and their efficacy is complicated by PD medication regimens. This precise DBS approach targets several relevant nodes within brain circuitry to provide stimulation therapy while monitoring
    multiple symptoms for efficacy. It can be used as an extra stimulation setting in already extant DBS devices (particularly those equipped for both stimulation and sensing). Many movement disorder patients with implanted DBS devices

    values estimated from the magnitude and relative phase values\nderived from measurements of multiple transmit and receive B1 fields. Using a 7\nTesla MRI system, results report high-quality in vivo human brain electrical\nproperty

    The FDA places guidance limits on heating and specific absorption rate (SAR) in humans during magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI), but there is currently no way to measure SAR locally. Generic numerical SAR models, which are not

    permittivity of biological tissues in vivo using a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. This technology is a novel gradient-based EPT approach with greatly improved tissue boundary reconstruction and largely elevated robustness against
    measurement noise compared to existing techniques. It also features a novel EPT G-algorithm that generates SAR maps, based on conductivity and permittivity, with potentially sufficient fidelity to accurately measure local SAR.

    Multi-Banded (MB) RF-pulse Enhanced Magnetization Imaging (MBE-MTI) uses multi-banded RF pulses in MT preparation. These multi-banded RF pulses not only provide simultaneous off-resonance saturations of bound water spins on both sides
    of the central\nfrequency of mobile water, but also increase the coverage of off-resonance frequency range without increasing the potential of direct saturations while eliminating the need to increase the gap between the central
    frequencies of mobile water and the MT RF pulse to maintain optimal MT contrast.
</p>

    Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) usually requires increased bandwidth to achieve off-resonance saturations of bound water spins within a large frequency range. A consequence of increasing the bandwidth is the undesired augmentation

    An algorithm using particle swarm optimization (PSO) in programming electrodes in deep brain stimulation arrays (DBSAs) provides clinicians with an intuitive, semi-automated approach for programming multi-electrode neuromodulation
    systems. The system and methods optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy by producing a range of optimal electrode configuration solutions that can achieve a number of objectives, such as maximizing neural activation of a region of
    interest, minimizing activation in a region where stimulation is not desired, minimizing battery power consumption, and maximizing the closeness to sources of sensed functional data. The computed solutions are presented visually to
    clinicians via Pareto front visualization, enabling them to intuitively select a stimulation setting that matches desired activation outcomes and programming goals for each specific patient.

    current delivered to the patient. This new approach is particularly robust when axonal activation could reasonably occur along multiple points along a given axon and is robust to variation of maximum electrode currents on each site.

    A new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parallel transmission (pTx) pulse design targets RF homogenization in multiband (MB) excitation and refocusing and other spin manipulations while limiting the specific absorption rate (SAR). These
    pulses can significantly improve RF uniformity in each image slice while largely reducing global and local SAR. With full pTx hardware capable of synthesizing channel specific RF waveforms, the new approach can design band-specific pTx
    multi-spoke RF pulses to improve signal and contrast uniformities while complying with both technical and safety limits. In the case of limited pTx capability (for example, that using phase and gain controllers to split a single RF
    output from the console), the new approach also provides an effective strategy to design band-joint pTx multi-spoke pulses that outperform the traditional single transmit RF pulses. The new approach was originally validated in the human
    brain at 7T using a 16-channel pTx system. Most recently, its utility for rapid acquisition of high resolution whole brain imaging has been demonstrated at 7T by using a commercial multi-channel transmit RF coil (Nova Medical) and
    acquiring Human Connectome Project (HCP) style diffusion and functional MRI. The pulse design algorithm can be used offline or integrated into scanners and can be used with current 3T or 7T scanners that allow for pTx acquisitions and
    new 3T or 7T scanners entering the market that come with pTx capability.
</p>

<p>
    Despite the many benefits of slice accelerated multiband methods, their optimal use at 3T and 7T is precluded by RF non-uniformity and SAR constraints. The RF non-uniformity will cause Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and image contrast to
    become spatially non-uniform across the brain or other organ under scan. The elevated SAR as a result of imaging acceleration has been a\nlimiting factor that prevents higher slice acceleration factors from being utilized (especially
    when a spin echo type sequence is employed such as in diffusion MRI). This new technology demonstrates that when acquiring 7T HCP style diffusion and functional MRI, using pTx MB pulses can produce better image quality and contrast than
    the state of the art HCP protocols relying on a\nsingle transmit configuration. For diffusion MRI, because of the SAR reduction, the use of pTx MB pulses can also double the slice acceleration (MB4 vs MB2), holding great potential for

    layout achieves simultaneous high-voltage compliance, high output impedance and high channel count. A foreground current calibration uses a single external capacitor to support the entire stimulation channels, and an active
    charge-balancing scheme uses a low-resolution SAR ADC\n(or comparator) to monitor the residual voltage and adapts subsequent stimulation current and timing parameters. A current steering network allows one set of current drivers to
    support multiple non-concurrent stimulation channels. The chip is designed in a high-voltage process that allows up to 20V power supply and 19V output voltage compliance. A broad range of current mode stimulation waveforms and patterns
    can be generated, including symmetrical/asymmetrical, biphasic/monophasic, and pulse train stimuli, and the current amplitude, pulse width and stimulation rate are all adjustable. Integrating two complementary charge-balancing
    techniques reduces residual voltage and stimulation artifacts. The stimulator triggers neural spikes, modulates neuronal firing rates and alters mesoscopic neuronal activity, and can support a wide variety of neuroscience applications
    requiring\nelectrical microstimulation.
</p>

    Previous stimulator designs that achieve high-voltage compliance and high output impedance are unsuitable for implantable devices due to bulky design, low channel count and high power consumption. System-on-chip (SoC) stimulators that
    employ feedback-assisted current mirror structure and high voltage processes require a large chip area, while off-chip DC blocking capacitors suffer from poor channel density and are difficult to integrate into large-scale stimulator
    implants. High-channel stimulator SoC are feasible, but because these designs often trade channel density for performance and lack mechanisms to actively monitor residual charge and ensure charge-balancing, they are not suitable for
    acute microstimulation applications. This new microstimulator chip presents a fully-integrated stimulator with high-voltage compliance, high output impedance, built-in foreground and active charge balancing. The design achieves a good
    trade-off between high performance and channel density due to adequate resource sharing and efficient chip layout. The smaller and more efficient design is scalable and retains the small chip area and high channel density needed for

    amplitude and frequency of the stimulus that drives each individual contact of the multichannel lead, thus the orientations of the electromagnetic stimulation is not controlled. This constant shape and frequency modulation limits the
    volume of neurons that can be consistently stimulated. In addition, neurons can adapt to continuous stimulation, resulting in diminished neuronal response and lessening neuromodulation efficacy. The novel electrode design provides more
    precise and efficient simulation by using orientation selective and rotating electric fields, where shaped pulses and phase modulation of the current more selectively control orientation of the field relative to axons (parallel
    orientation allows \xa0maximal stimulation). This new, more flexible approach allows selective tuning of the excitation to the relevant population of neurons or axons, eliminating tissue damage from excessive heat production and eddy
    currents, and offering a controllable strategy easily adapted to avoid seizures and other side effects (such as heat damage). Furthermore, the new electrode design features geometric configurations that further improve performance.

    A first-ever magnetic brain array can modulate (stimulate) neuron cells and other biological components sensitive to magnetic fields. The array offers low energy consumption and high density, and consists of magnetic tunneling junction
    (MTJ) sensors for 3D mapping with potential for closed-loop operation. The technique generates magnetic fields for biomedical applications by rotating a magnetic layer in an MTJ and using electrical current and/or light to modulate the
    magnetic status of the magnetic nanostructures. The magnetic nanostructure stimulation array is integrated with a magnetic sensor mapping array into one chip for simultaneous mapping.

    Current electrical-based stimulation devices have limited ability to “steer” stimulation to highly targeted locations. Moreover, the simulation points must be in direct contact with the targeted tissue. This new magnetic array offers
    more precise stimulations of the intended target, thereby reducing stimulation-induced side effects. It features an array of magnetic (not electrical) nanowires in which localized magnetic stimulation is generated to provide non-contact
    stimulation. Compared to state-of-art electrode based neuron modulation array, this new array reduces power requirements, offers higher density arrays than standard electrical-based DBS, and delivers more precise stimulation.

    A unique algorithm quickly and accurately determines optimal stimulation settings for deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode arrays. The algorithm generates a patient-specific “grid,” representing a target tissue to be activated, by
    compiling brain geometry and lead-specific geometry data. It then determines a maximum activation function value for each point on the grid and uses an optimization method to calculate optimal stimulation settings for each electrode on
    the DBS array. By steering current through a deep brain stimulation array (DBSA), clinicians may be able to more effectively treat symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, dystonia, severe obsessive compulsive disorder and
    other neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.

    Standard DBS leads, which effectively treat disorders like Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor, consist of only four electrodes. A DBSA, however, may a higher number of electrodes arranged along and around one or more DBS leads.
    While having more electrodes vastly increases current steering capability, it also presents new programming challenges. Conventional programming methods using clinical exams are often tedious and long in duration and do not take the
    unique structure of a patient’s brain tissue into account. Other computational modeling approaches require vast computational resources that a clinical setting may not have. This new optimization algorithm surpasses these obstacles by
    providing quick, patient-specific stimulation settings and recognizing that therapeutic “hot spots” may differ from patient to patient.

    An imaging device based on the variable near infrared (VNIR) Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) system can be used for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The device combines conventional imaging with spectrophotometry to create
    pixel-level spectral quantification of a sample. The HSI system is non-invasive; imaging samples are obtained through a simple retinal scan that doesn’t require any dyes or additional reagents.
</p>

<p>
    Prior to cognitive symptoms of AD, plaques form in the brain from amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, an event known as Aβ aggregation. <i>In vitro </i>assessment with this new imaging system detected cellular cytoplasmic changes before Aβ
    aggregation. In mouse tests, AD was detected 25% sooner than visible plaque formation. This is the only existing diagnostic method that can detect AD before Aβ plaque formation. This diagnostic approach may be critical to new compound
    development\xa0 and commercialization to halt and reverse disease progression.
</p>
,
<p>
    The efficacy of current AD treatments is severely limited by the lack of an early diagnostic method. Presently, patients can only be diagnosed with AD after visible plaques have formed in their brains. At this point, treatments can only
    slow down the inevitable progression of cognitive symptoms. With the new HSI system, a physician could make an AD diagnosis long before visible\nplaques formed in the patient’s brain. This would enable the patient to begin treatment
    significantly sooner, improving their prognosis.
</p>
,
<p>Additionally, the HSI system could be used to determine the success of AD treatments by measuring cellular changes and levels of Aβ aggregation. This would enable physicians to fine-tune treatments to better suit the patient’s needs.</p>
